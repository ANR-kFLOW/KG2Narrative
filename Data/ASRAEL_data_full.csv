""And of course indirectly, they are absolutely an interference in our domestic affairs.""</p><p>A US mission spokeswoman said US embassies and consulates around the world routinely issue safety messages to US citizens.</p><p>""This is a common, routine practice of many countries' diplomatic missions,"" she told AFP on Sunday.</p><p>The US embassy in Moscow on Saturday said that Washington supported ""the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression"".</p><p></p><hl2>- Protests in over 100 cities -</hl2><p></p><p>Peskov also accused protest organisers of seeking to ""rock the boat"" and said the number of people who had demonstrated paled in comparison to Putin supporters.</p><p>""A lot of people vote for Putin,"" Peskov said, pointing to last year's constitutional plebiscite that allowed 68-year-old Putin to remain in power until 2036.</p><p>Navalny, Putin's most prominent critic, was arrested on returning to Moscow last weekend following months of treatment in Germany for a near-fatal poisoning with a Soviet-designed Novichok nerve agent.</p><p>He then called for Saturday's unauthorised protests, which took on an unprecedented geographic scale, spanning more than 100 cities. </p><p>Around 20,000 people protested in Moscow and more than 10,000 in Saint Petersburg, according to estimates from AFP journalists, with rallies also held in numerous countries including France and Lithuania.</p><p>Leonid Volkov, the head of Navalny's regional network, praised the turnout.</p><p>""I am certainly proud, very impressed and inspired,"" Volkov told AFP. Navalny's team is hoping to stage another rally next weekend.</p><p>Many at the protests said they were angered by the findings of a Navalny investigation into an opulent Black Sea property allegedly owned by Putin. </p><p>Peskov said the luxury mansion on the Black Sea was ""private"" property and had nothing to do with Putin.</p><p></p><hl2>- Protester in intensive care -</hl2><p></p><p>Moscow officials said that 29 people received medical assistance in hospitals and were released. </p><p>Saint Petersburg prosecutors said they were probing violations on ""the part of law enforcement"" and the use of force against a woman.</p><p>The statement was released after local media published a video showing a middle-aged woman falling to the ground after being kicked by riot police.</p><p>In the video, a woman -- identified as Margarita Yudina -- is seen asking three policemen in full riot gear why they were detaining a young unarmed protester. One of the policeman then kicks her in the stomach.</p><p>The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it had launched criminal inquiries in Moscow over the use of violence against law enforcement, hooliganism and property damage.</p><p>The OVD Info monitor said police seized at least 3,521 protesters, with 1,398 people detained in Moscow and 526 in Saint Petersburg.</p><p>The head of the Kremlin's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, said most of those detained in Moscow had been released.</p><p>He also defended the detentions, saying the protests were illegal and took place during a coronavirus pandemic. ""I see no violations whatsoever,"" he said. </p><p>Navalny, who rose to prominence a decade ago, accuses the FSB security agency of seeking to poison him on Putin's orders. </p><p>He is the target of several criminal probes and supporters fear authorities are planning to sentence him to a long prison term.</p><p>mak-as/dl/pvh/har</p><p><org>GOOGLE</org></p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

Truth. Russia"".</p><p></p><hl2>- A meme movement -</hl2><p></p><p>Many of the demonstrators expected they would face consequences for attending the rallies, which saw some 3,500 people detained nationwide. </p><p>On TikTok, the video-sharing app popular with teenagers, users shared videos preparing for the protests with a song featuring the lyrics: ""I will get jailed"".</p><p>The power of the internet was visible at the rallies in other ways too.</p><p>One viral photo from over the weekend was of police detaining Russia's own version of the so-called ""Q Shaman"": a man wearing a fur headdress with horns.</p><p>emg/jbr/wdb</p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

One of the policeman then kicks her in the stomach.</p><p>Yudina was hospitalised in a ""serious condition"" with a head injury before being released on Sunday evening, local health committee spokeswoman Olga Riabinina told AFP.</p><p>The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it had launched criminal inquiries in Moscow over the use of violence against law enforcement, hooliganism and property damage.</p><p>In a separate statement, investigators said a 36-year-old man was detained after hitting two policemen at the Saint Petersburg protest.</p><p>The OVD Info monitor said police seized at least 3,521 protesters, with 1,398 people detained in Moscow and 526 in Saint Petersburg.</p><p>The head of the Kremlin's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, said most of those detained in Moscow had been released.</p><p>He also defended the detentions, saying the protests were illegal and took place during a coronavirus pandemic. ""I see no violations whatsoever,"" he said. </p><p>Navalny, who rose to prominence a decade ago, accuses the FSB security agency of seeking to poison him on Putin's orders. </p><p>He is the target of several criminal probes and supporters fear authorities are planning to sentence him to a long prison term.</p><p>mak-as/dl/har</p><p><org>GOOGLE</org></p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure in his fourth re-election battle in two years, is trying to court voters he has previously demonised: Arab Israelis.</p><p>""A new era begins today,"" the veteran right-wing premier said during a rare visit this month to Nazareth, Israel's largest Arab city.</p><p>Netanyahu, threatened by a damaging split in his Likud party, has made several stops in a game-changing charm offensive toward Arab voters that some observers have found jarring.</p><p>He highlighted Israel's rapid novel coronavirus inoculation pace at a vaccination centre in Umm al-Fahm on January 1, while in Nazareth he promised investment and anti-crime initiatives and apologised for potentially offensive past remarks.</p><p>Arab Israelis -- Palestinians who stayed on their land following the Jewish state's creation in 1948, and their descendants -- make up about 20 percent of the country's roughly nine million people.</p><p>The community's growing political importance was evident in the last vote, in March 2020, when the mainly Arab Joint List alliance won an unprecedented 15 seats in the 120-member Knesset, forming a key part of the anti-Netanyahu bloc.</p><p>Netanyahu, a hardliner on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, has on several occasions in recent years condemned Arab Israelis and their political leaders as terrorism supporters and enemies of the Jewish state.</p><p>Experts described his new pitch to Arabs as a nuanced political manoeuvre aimed at boosting his own support while also sowing enough political chaos to discourage some Arabs from voting, thereby trimming the influence of his Arab rivals.</p><p>Netanyahu is seeking to ""win Arab votes but especially wants to weaken the Joint List"", Tel Aviv University political science professor Jamal Amal told AFP.</p><p></p><hl2>- Discrimination -</hl2><p></p><p>Among Netanyahu's long record of anti-Arab rhetoric, a statement from Israel's 2015 election stands out.</p><p>In a polling-day bid to energise right-wing voters, he warned that Arab Israelis were voting ""in droves"" and suggested left-wing groups had bussed Arab citizens to polling stations.</p><p>Then-US president Barack Obama accused Netanyahu of portraying Arab Israelis as ""an invading force"".</p><p>Arabs have long complained of discrimination by Israeli police, and insist their plight has worsened since Netanyahu returned to power in 2009.</p><p>The so-called Nation-State law passed in 2018 at Netanyahu's urging, which declared Israel as the ""national home of the Jewish people"", was widely perceived as legally downgrading Arabs as lesser citizens.</p><p>Despite that record, Netanyahu has often argued that his governments have invested heavily in minority communities and ""done more for Arabs than any other government"".</p><p>While some protesters in Nazareth attempted to shout Netanyahu down, the premier secured an endorsement from the city's mayor, Ali Salam.</p><p></p><hl2>- 'Breaking the polygraph' -</hl2><p></p><p>Netanyahu, known as the great survivor of Israeli politics, faces the daunting challenge of securing a 61-seat Knesset majority in Israel's March 23 election.</p><p>Multiple recent polls suggest that right-wing Likud defector Gideon Saar, who has formed his own New Hope party, could peel a substantial number of seats away from Netanyahu.</p><p>Saar has categorically ruled out joining a Netanyahu-led government.</p><p>The pledge, if true, could deliver a hammer blow to the premier, who failed to secure a majority in three elections since April 2019 when Likud was united behind him.</p><p>The fraught coalition he formed with his centrist rival Benny Gantz in May following the third inconclusive election collapsed last month.</p><p>Because of the Saar threat and the dangers posed by his upcoming corruption trial, Netanyahu has been forced to seek support in unfamiliar terrain, experts said.</p><p>The prime minister has reached out to Mansour Abbas, a lawmaker from the Joint List, who is at odds with the Arab alliance.</p><p>Political analyst Yoav Stern told AFP he believes Netanyahu's true strategy is ""to confuse Arab voters"" so they will ""tell themselves that all parties are equal and there is no reason to go and vote"".</p><p>Jafar Farah, who heads the Mossawa Center that works to defend Arab Israeli rights, said Netanyahu has decided to soften his anti-Arab rhetoric because he fears that energising Jewish nationalist sentiment could benefit his right-wing opponents.</p><p>Joint List member Ahmad Tibi, more bluntly, charged that underlying Netanyahu's bid to win over Arabs is a dishonesty that has defined the premier's political career.</p><p>""If we gave Netanyahu a polygraph test,"" Tibi said, ""the machine would break because it wouldn't be able to cope with that many lies.""</p><p>mab-cgo/bs/fz</p><p><org>STERN GROEP</org></p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

""This president should not hold office one day longer.""</p><p>""If the Vice President and the Cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,"" Schumer said.</p><p>US lawmakers had begun to address the question of power transfer from the chief executive in the late 1950s amid the ill health of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p><p>It took on added urgency following the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the 25th Amendment was passed by Congress in 1965 and ratified by the required three-fourths of the 50 US states two years later.</p><p>Section 3 of the 25th Amendment addresses the transfer of presidential powers to the vice president when the chief executive declares that he or she is unable to fulfill the powers and duties of the office.</p><p>Section 4 addresses a situation in which the vice president and a majority of the cabinet determine that the president is no longer able to discharge their duties. This section has never been invoked.</p><p></p><hl2>- Invoked on three occasions -</hl2><p></p><p>Section 3 has been invoked three times.</p><p>The first was in July 1985 when President Ronald Reagan underwent surgery under general anesthesia for removal of a cancerous polyp from his large intestine.</p><p>Vice President George H.W. Bush was made acting president for about eight hours while Reagan was in surgery. </p><p>President George W. Bush temporarily transferred power to Vice President Dick Cheney in June 2002 and in July 2007 while he underwent routine colonoscopies under anesthesia.</p><p>Following Reagan's serious wounding in a 1981 assassination attempt, a letter invoking Section 3 was drafted but it was never sent.</p><p>Under Section 3, the president informs the president pro tempore, or presiding officer, of the Senate -- currently Republican Chuck Grassley -- and the speaker of the House of Representatives, currently Democrat Nancy Pelosi -- in writing that he is unable to discharge the duties of the office and is temporarily transferring power to the vice president.</p><p>Under Section 4, the vice president and a majority of the members of the cabinet inform the leaders of the Senate and House that the president is incapable of discharging his duties and the vice president becomes acting president.</p><p>""It's time to evoke the 25th Amendment and end this nightmare,"" Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said after Wednesday's mayhem in Washington.</p><p>""The president is unfit. And the president is unwell,"" he added.</p><p>If a president contests the determination that he or she is unable to fulfill their duties, it is up to Congress to make the decision.</p><p>A two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate would be needed to declare the president unfit to remain in office.</p><p>Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe has claimed that former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein raised the possibility of invoking Section 4 against Trump after he abruptly fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017.</p><p>But Rosenstein has denied the allegation.</p><p>cl/dw/st</p></body.content></nitf>"

Top Republican senator Mitch McConnell was warning of a democratic ""death spiral"" if Biden's win was overturned.</p><p>The first sign of trouble came as some Congressional offices were evacuated with pro-Trump protesters demonstrating outside. Shortly after, the mob began storming the Capitol itself. </p><p>Thousands descended on the building.

Minutes later the first reports of one person being shot and wounded inside the US Capitol emerged. The victim, a woman, died several hours later.</p><p>Pence, also on Twitter, issued his own -- much more forceful -- call for the violence to ""stop now."" Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle as well as foreign leaders watching in horror began following suit. </p><p></p><hl2>- Biden takes the stage -</hl2><p></p><p>With the president holding back from forcefully condemning the violence it was his successor, Joe Biden, who was the first to go on television and brand it an ""insurrection.""</p><p>""I call on President Trump to go on national television now to... demand an end to this siege,"" the veteran Democrat said in Wilmington, Delaware. </p><p>""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, the floor of the United States Senate... threatening the safety of duly elected officials? It's not a protest, it's insurrection.""</p><p></p><hl2>- Trump to protesters: 'We love you' -</hl2><p></p><p>Minutes after Biden spoke, Trump tweeted a video in which he told supporters to ""go home"" -- but repeated his incendiary claim the election was ""stolen"" and told them ""We love you.""</p><p>""I know your pain,"" Trump said in a one-minute video on Twitter. """"We had an election that was stolen from us.</p><p>""But you have to go home now,"" he said. ""We have to have peace. We have to have law and order.""</p><p>Inside the Capitol more photos were emerging of rioters inside the debating chamber, occupying the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, posing for selfies and carrying away souvenirs. </p><p></p><hl2>- Riot police push mob back -</hl2><p></p><p>But -- as Facebook and Twitter began limiting and removing both Trump's posts and other posts stoking violence -- police in riot gear and backed by the National Guard set up a perimeter around the Capitol building.</p><p>Using more tear gas they finally began to push the mob back. </p><p>As the 6:00 pm curfew began, thousands were still surrounding the grounds and streets outside the Capitol.</p><p></p><hl2>- Congress vows to resume -</hl2><p></p><p>US media quoted the sergeants-at-arms of the House of Representatives and the Senate as saying the Capitol was finally secure about four hours after it first came under attack.</p><p>House Speaker Pelosi said the Biden win certification would resume ""tonight,"" once the Capitol was secure. </p><p>The senior lawmaker blasted the storming of the Capitol as a ""shameful assault"" but said ""it cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden.""</p><p>Shortly after 8:00 pm, lawmakers resumed their task.</p><p>bur-st/ec</p></body.content></nitf>"

Eisenhower.</p><p>It took on added urgency following the 1963 assassination of president John F. Kennedy, and the 25th Amendment was passed by Congress in 1965 and ratified by the required three-fourths of the 50 US states two years later.</p><p>Section 3 of the 25th Amendment addresses the transfer of presidential powers to the vice president when the chief executive declares that he or she is unable to fulfill the powers and duties of the office.</p><p>Section 4 addresses a situation in which the vice president and a majority of the cabinet determine that the president is no longer able to discharge their duties.

Bush was made acting president for about eight hours while Reagan was in surgery. </p><p>President George W. Bush temporarily transferred power to vice president Dick Cheney in June 2002 and in July 2007 while he underwent routine colonoscopies under anesthesia.</p><p>Following Reagan's serious wounding in a 1981 assassination attempt, a letter invoking Section 3 was drafted but it was never sent.</p><p>Under Section 3, the president informs the president pro tempore, or presiding officer, of the Senate -- currently Republican Chuck Grassley -- and the speaker of the House of Representatives, currently Pelosi -- in writing that he is unable to discharge the duties of the office and is temporarily transferring power to the vice president.</p><p>Under Section 4, the vice president and a majority of the members of the cabinet inform the leaders of the Senate and House that the president is incapable of discharging his duties and the vice president becomes acting president.</p><p>If a president contests the determination that he or she is unable to fulfill their duties, it is up to Congress to make the decision.</p><p>A two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate would be needed to declare the president unfit to remain in office.</p><p>Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe has claimed that former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein raised the possibility of invoking Section 4 against Trump after he abruptly fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017.</p><p>Rosenstein has denied the allegation.</p><p>cl/ft</p></body.content></nitf>"

Hahish",2021-01-28T09:58:28Z,"<nitf><body.content><p>Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank are demanding concessions from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of a March general election which could hinge on a battle for right-wing votes. </p><p>While most countries consider all Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal, Israel broadly divides them into two categories: government-recognised settlements and so-called wildcat outposts. </p><p>In the former, Israel aims to provide similar services -- water, electricity and the like -- as it does to citizens within its internationally agreed borders.</p><p>Wildcat settlements, often ramshackle collections of portacabins set up by hardline religious nationalists deep inside the West Bank, generally have no connection to the Israeli grid.</p><p>Some outposts have been given retrospective authorisation in the past, particularly by Netanyahu-led governments.</p><p>As another Israeli election nears, pro-settler groups are using tactics including a hunger strike outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem office to demand recognition for another 70 wildcat outposts, home to some 25,000 of the 650,000 settlers in east Jerusalem and the West Bank.</p><p>Yossi Dagan, an influential settler leader who staged a week-long protest fast outside the premier's office this month, insisted that distinguishing between types of settlements was ""absurd"".</p><p>""There is no logical reason why 25,000 Israeli citizens do not have the same rights as others, it's not a political question, it's a question of social rights,"" he said.</p><p></p><hl2>- Limited 'wiggle room' -</hl2><p></p><p>Dagan, head of a regional council for Israeli settlements in the northern West Bank, fainted and was briefly hospitalised after speaking to AFP last week.</p><p>He had launched his hunger strike as former US president Donald Trump was about to leave office -- timing that experts suspect was far from coincidental.</p><p>Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967. </p><p>Both Republican and Democratic US administrations have long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory. </p><p>But Trump's staunchly pro-Israel administration broke with this policy, announcing in 2019 that it did not regard such activity as illegal.  </p><p>Trump's four-year term saw an unprecedented boom in settlement construction and spared Netanyahu from Washington's traditional criticism in response to new West Bank housing projects. </p><p>President Joe Biden is set to restore Washington's opposition to settlements, so right-wing settlers are trying use the window before Israel's next election to secure firm commitments from Netanyahu -- who is desperate for their votes. </p><p>""The settlers know that (with Biden in office) the government's wiggle room will not be as great as it was during Trump's tenure, so they need promises, not just statements of support"" from Israeli politicians, said Denis Charbit, a political scientist at the Open University of Israel. </p><p>Hagit Ofran, who monitors settlements for the Israeli anti-occupation group Peace Now, said Biden's presidency and Israel's election results could impact both wildcat settlement recognition and broader questions around the ""appropriation of Palestinian land"".</p><p></p><hl2>- Battle for the right -</hl2><p></p><p>Netanyahu partly owes his record as Israel's longest-serving premier, in power since 2009, to his status as the unchallenged leader of the Israeli right. </p><p>But polls suggest the March election, Israel's fourth is less than two years, could swing against him.</p><p>Gideon Saar, a leading right-winger with pro-settler credentials, defected from Netanyahu's Likud party last year, and polls suggest his breakaway party could win a solid chunk of seats in the parliament.</p><p>Surveys also suggest that the staunchly pro-settler Yemina party of Naftali Bennett, a former defence and economy minister, is on the rise. </p><p>Both Saar and Bennett have ruled out joining a Netanyahu-led coalition, which could complicate the premier's bid to forge a 61-seat majority -- something he already failed to do after three recent elections when the Likud was united behind him. </p><p>In Givat Hahish, a wildcat outpost near Bethlehem where some 40 families live in a mixture of mobile homes and permanent dwellings, father of four Matan Fingerhut declined to state his political preferences. </p><p>But he made clear that he wants political recognition of Givat Hahish. </p><p>""I like this place and I want to live here legally,"" said Fingerhut, who built his own house on a hill without Israeli government permission.</p><p>He said he hoped recognition could lead to better services. </p><p>""We often find ourselves in the dark, without heating, without hot water,"" he said.</p><p>Uriya Loberbaum, a 38-year-old father of five, recently staged an 18-day hunger strike in support of recognition for his wildcat settlement of Sde Boaz. </p><p>He dismisses the international consensus that the West Bank must form part of a future Palestinian state.  </p><p>""We have to make it clear that it is ours, this region belongs to the Jewish people,"" he said.</p><p>mib/scw/bs/par/kir</p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

However, the situation has major differences from the crisis over the 737 MAX, which was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes.</p><p></p><hl2>- What happened? -</hl2><p></p><p>A United Airlines flight bound for Hawaii quickly returned to Denver soon after takeoff Saturday after one of the engines caught fire and began breaking apart, scattering debris over a nearby suburb.</p><p>The incident badly shook passengers, but nobody was harmed -- a huge difference from the two tragic crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines MAX planes that together claimed 346 lives and led to the aircraft being banned from the skies for 20 months. </p><p>In the aftermath of the Denver incident, US and Japanese aviation authorities grounded the planes, and Britain banned them from its airspace.</p><p>In addition, about a half dozen carriers around the world removed from service 69 planes that had the same Pratt & Whitney PW 4000 engine involved in the incident.</p><p>Federal Aviation Administrator Steve Dickson ordered ""immediate or stepped-up"" inspections on 777 planes with the same engines.</p><p></p><hl2>- What is the nature of the problem? -</hl2><p></p><p>Investigations are ongoing, but Dickson said the probe would center on ""hollow fan blades"" unique to these Pratt & Whitney engines. The vast majority of the more than 1,600 777 aircraft that have been delivered over the years do not have this type of engine.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which also is investigating the incident, said an initial examination showed two fan blades were fractured.</p><p>Michel Merluzeau, an expert at consultancy AIR, said the problem with the engine could stem from an issue with metallurgy, fabrication, maintenance or operations.</p><p>""It's not really a problem for Boeing,"" he said. ""It's more an issue of maintenance -- how United or Pratt & Whitney is maintaining engines that have been in use for a while.""</p><p>Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia said the inspection probably would only require a matter of days, but even so airlines may not rush to return the jets to service because of the overcapacity of widebody planes and the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p></p><hl2>- How will the incident affect Boeing's business? -</hl2><p></p><p>Again the situation differs from the MAX, which had been Boeing's most popular plane. The lengthy grounding meant Boeing could not deliver aircraft during that period, badly denting revenues.</p><p>By contrast, the 777 models have been in service for years, and Pratt & Whitney has not manufactured this engine for 15 years, Aboulafia said.</p><p>Moreover, ""after all those years of service, it is unlikely to be a design issue with the engine,"" said Aboulafia, adding that the problem seems to lie with maintenance.</p><p></p><hl2>- What does this latest issue say about Boeing? -</hl2><p></p><p>While the particulars of this 777 problem do not appear to relate to Boeing's manufacturing, the issue comes at a ""bad moment"" for the aviation giant, Merluzeau said.</p><p>Besides the MAX debacle, Boeing's deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner were delayed after problems were unearthed during inspections. Boeing also pushed back the timing for its new 777X amid the downturn in commercial plane travel.</p><p>Boeing's operational problems in recent years dwarf those at rival Airbus, which also is struggling with reduced plane demand amid the coronavirus.</p><p>Merluzeau expects a major rethink of Boeing production systems in the coming years, with ""big changes"" in plane development and manufacturing.</p><p>jum-jmb/hs</p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

He then saw big waves.</p><p>Preliminary data suggested it was ""most likely"" that the plane was intact when it hit the water, according to a senior Indonesian transport safety agency investigator.</p><p></p><hl2>- Who was on board? -</hl2><p>The plane was carrying 50 passengers, including 10 children, and 12 crew members.</p><p>The captain was Afwan, a 54-year-old veteran aviator who flew for the Indonesian Air Force from 1987 to 1998, according to local media. </p><p>Married with three children, he was known as a devout Muslim and well-respected figure in his local community. </p><p>The profile of one of his social media accounts was reported to be a picture of Superman praying alongside the words: ""no matter how high you fly, you won't reach heaven if you don't pray five times a day"".</p><p>Among the passengers were newlyweds Putri Wahyuni and Ihsan Adhlan Hakim, en route to their wedding celebration.  </p><p>Rapin Akbar spoke to AFP after giving blood for DNA analysis at a hospital where body bags with human remains were being taken. He said he had five relatives on board, including an older sister, a nephew and his wife and their seven-month-old baby.</p><p></p><hl2>- What kind of plane was it? - </hl2><p>It was part of the Boeing 737 Classic series, a popular workhorse aircraft that entered service in 1990. The model used by Sriwijaya Air was configured to carry a maximum of 120 passengers, according to the carrier's website. </p><p>The jet was 26 years old and had previously been flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.</p><p>""This (plane) is considered an ageing aircraft and has special added inspections to perform by the airlines to ensure airworthiness,"" said Michael Daniel, a retired US Federal Aviation Administration officer who is now an international aviation consultant.</p><p>It was not a variant of Boeing's newer MAX series, which was grounded worldwide after two deadly crashes six months apart, in Indonesia and Ethiopia.</p><p></p><hl2>- Does Indonesia have a poor aviation safety record? - </hl2><p>In short, yes. The number of people flying in the world's biggest archipelagic nation of over 17,000 islands has skyrocketed but safety standards have failed to keep pace.</p><p>The most serious crash in recent years was the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max accident in 2018, which claimed 189 lives, although that was blamed on the aircraft's faulty anti-stall system.</p><p>Others include the 2014 crash of an AirAsia jet with the loss of 162 lives and a year later, the crash of a military plane shortly after take-off, killing 140 people.</p><p>But Sriwijaya Air had not previously recorded a fatal crash since starting operations in 2003. </p><p>More minor accidents also occur frequently in a country where conditions for pilots can be challenging, ranging from poorly-maintained runways to mountainous terrain and sudden tropical downpours.</p><p>One of the more unusual air accidents in Indonesia happened in 2013 when a passenger jet crashed into a cow and skidded off the runway as it came into land at a small airport on Sulawesi island. </p><p>The only casualty was the cow, crushed to death under the Lion Air plane's wheels. </p><p>bur-sr/pb/am</p><p><org>BOEING</org></p><p><org>UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS</org></p><p><org>AIRASIA BHD</org></p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

Both armies are later charged in The Hague with looting Congo's resources, killing and torturing civilians and using child soldiers.</p><p>Museveni would also be accused of supporting rebels in the region -- an allegation that would resurface time and time again during his long tenure.</p><p></p><hl2>- Broken promises -</hl2><p></p><p>In 2001, Museveni defeats his main opposition rival Kizza Besigye at the ballot box, and commits to standing down at the next election. </p><p>But instead, he changes the constitution in 2005 to do away with presidential term limits.</p><p>The following year -- his 20th in power -- he again defeats a popular Besigye in a vote marred by violence and irregularities.</p><p>That same year, the Lord's Resistance Army is largely driven out of northern Uganda after a grinding and brutal 20-year insurgency -- although Ugandan troops hunt the rebel leadership in Sudan, DRC and Central African Republic for another decade.</p><p>Museveni pleases Washington -- a close friend which has provided Uganda billions in foreign aid -- by sending troops to serve under the US in Iraq and to Somalia, where they form the backbone of an African Union mission to confront Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists Al-Shabaab.</p><p></p><hl2>- Drift toward autocracy - </hl2><p></p><p>In 2010 the UN accuses Ugandan troops of war crimes in eastern Congo. Uganda threatens to withdraw its peacekeepers from Somalia, South Sudan, Darfur, Ivory Coast and East Timor -- a trump card it would use again in future when accused of further meddling in DRC.</p><p>Museveni wins a fourth term in 2011 over Besigye, who again decries the vote as a sham. Not long after, security forces are deployed to violently suppress major street protests as food and fuel prices soar and the economy teeters.</p><p>Ugandan troops fight alongside South Sudan's forces as the new country descends into civil war in 2013. At home, the crackdown on critics intensifies, with radio stations taken off air and newspapers raided for airing suggestions Museveni is grooming his son for succession.</p><p>In 2014, Museveni signs a controversial anti-gay bill into law, drawing resounding criticism from around the globe, and attracting US sanctions and a freeze on EU donor funds.</p><p></p><hl2>- President for life - </hl2><p></p><p>""I am not power-hungry, but mission-hungry"" Museveni said in 2015, describing the economic transformation of Uganda as his only purpose, and vowing to return to cattle-keeping should he lose the election the following year.</p><p>But he won that, too, and proceeded in 2017 to change the constitution once more.

Here are five things to know about the East African nation: </p><p></p><hl2>- Pearl of Africa -</hl2><p></p><p>Uganda is landlocked, straddling the equator roughly 800 kilometres (500 miles) inland from the Indian Ocean and borders five nations -- South Sudan to the north, Rwanda and Tanzania to the south, Kenya to the east, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the west.</p><p>Though it has no access to the sea, Uganda is in the middle of Africa's Great Lakes region and is nearly one-fifth water. It boasts a long shoreline on Lake Victoria, is criss-crossed by a major tributary of the Nile, and sources most of its electricity from hydropower.</p><p>It is roughly the same size as the United Kingdom, encompassing some 241,000 square kilometres (93,000 square miles) of misty rainforests, great lakes and swamps, plateaus and snow-capped mountains -- a natural diversity that earned Uganda the colonial-era moniker the ""Pearl of Africa"".</p><p>Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a tranche of ancient forest in the country's southwest, is home to half the world's mountain gorillas while Mount Stanley, on the border with DRC, is Africa's third-highest peak at 5,109 metres (16,762 feet).</p><p></p><hl2>- Young population -</hl2><p></p><p>Britain's protectorate in Uganda was forged in 1894 from a group of neighbouring and sometimes rival kingdoms, including the dominant Buganda kingdom in the south and Bunyoro in the northwest.</p><p>Christian missionaries had arrived not long before, as did the first British explorers seeking the source of the Nile. Today, three-quarters of Uganda follows Christianity, and English and Swahili are the official languages though the country is multilingual.</p><p>Uganda is one of the youngest countries in the world, with a median age of 15.9 years. Nearly half its 45 million people are 14 or under, while just two percent are aged over 65.</p><p>It is also growing quickly. The population has nearly doubled since the turn of the century and the fertility rate remains among the world's highest, with about five children born to every woman, according to the UN Population Fund.</p><p></p><hl2>- Black gold -</hl2><p></p><p>But the economy struggles to keep up. About 700,000 young people reach working age every year -- a figure set to rise to one million by 2030 -- but only 75,000 new jobs are created for them.</p><p>The World Bank says this disparity, if left unaddressed, will keep most young Ugandans locked in poor-quality jobs or unpaid work on the family farm, while dragging on growth and efforts to diversify the economy.</p><p>Uganda is blessed with fertile soils and most of the country is engaged in agriculture, with coffee, vegetables, tea and fish among the top exports.</p><p>But the discovery of an estimated 1.7 billion barrels of oil in the northwest Lake Albert region has buoyed hopes of boosting economic growth and stemming reliance on foreign aid, though environmental and social concerns have been raised.</p><p></p><hl2>- Troubled neighbourhood - </hl2><p></p><p>Nestled in one of Africa's most volatile regions, Uganda has been involved in numerous armed and bloody conflicts at home and abroad since achieving independence from Britain in 1962.</p><p>Ugandan troops have fought two wars in DRC, clashed with Rwandan forces, backed government soldiers in South Sudan, and hunted rebel movements both inside their borders and beyond in places like Central African Republic and eastern Congo. </p><p>President Yoweri Museveni, who took power at the head of a rebel army in 1986, has tried to position himself as something of a regional statesman and peace broker, but has faced allegations of meddling and UN accusations that his forces committed war crimes in DRC.</p><p>An ally of the United States in its global ""war on terror"", Ugandan soldiers have served as guards under US command in Iraq, and since 2007 have been the largest contingent of African soldiers in Somalia fighting the Islamist militants Al-Shabaab.</p><p></p><hl2>- Open doors -</hl2><p></p><p>Uganda has a long history of accepting refugees from over its borders, and hosts more civilians fleeing persecution than anywhere else in Africa.</p><p>Uganda's refugee population has tripled since mid-2016 and is now approximately 1.4 million -- one for roughly every 30 of its citizens -- mostly from South Sudan and DRC.</p><p>Bidibidi, a sprawling refugee settlement in the country's north, houses 250,000 people, rivalling most Ugandan cities in population. </p><p>Uganda's refugee policy is relatively progressive, allowing the displaced to move freely and access jobs and land, but aid groups say they struggle to assist the ever-expanding population.</p><p>np/fb/dl</p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

Here are some excerpts from his inaugural address.</p><p></p><hl2>- The election, and democracy -</hl2><p></p><p>This is America's day. This is democracy's day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve through a crucible for the ages. America has been tested anew, and America has risen to the challenge.</p><p>Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people, the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.</p><p>We've learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. </p><p></p><hl2>- The Congress attack -</hl2><p></p><p>Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.</p><p></p><hl2>- Covid and 'this dark winter' -</hl2><p></p><p>Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found the time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. (A) once in a century virus that silently stalks the country. It's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost, hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.</p><p>In the work ahead of us, we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.  </p><p>We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.</p><p></p><hl2>- Racial justice -</hl2><p></p><p>A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.  </p><p>We can deliver racial justice and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world.</p><p>I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart.</p><p></p><hl2>- A president for all America -</hl2><p></p><p>Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.  </p><p>Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war.</p><p>To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America.</p><p>The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly, disagreement must not lead to disunion.  </p><p>And I pledge this to you, I will be a president for all Americans. All Americans.</p><p>We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue. Rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.</p><p>We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility... because here's this thing about life: There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. </p><p></p><hl2>- Truth and lies -</hl2><p></p><p>We must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.</p><p>Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies, lies told for power and for profit.</p><p>And each of us has a duty and a responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies.  </p><p>bur-bgs/ft</p></body.content></nitf>"

who shattered political norms by ruthlessly belittling rivals, denouncing entire ethnic groups and trying to cast doubt on basic facts.</p><p>""I will be a president for all Americans,"" the veteran Democrat said.</p><p>But Biden confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as evidenced during Trump's presidency by the Capitol assault, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants, and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>The United States faces ""a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat,"" Biden said.</p><p>""Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear and demonization have long torn us apart.""</p><p>At 78, Biden is the oldest-ever US president, a job he first sought in 1987, and is only the second Roman Catholic president after John F Kennedy. </p><p>Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history, and the first Black person and first person of Asian heritage as the nation's number two. </p><p>She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever ""second gentleman"" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who became a hero by luring away the mostly white

national intelligence chief Avril Haines.</p><p></p><hl2>- Empty Washington -</hl2><p></p><p>Washington took on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops who sealed off the city center.</p><p>With the public essentially barred from attending the proceedings, Biden's audience instead was 200,000 flags planted to represent the crowds absent from the National Mall.</p><p>Biden, who has vowed a major escalation in the nation's Covid vaccination drive, warned that the ""toughest and deadliest period"" was still ahead. </p><p>So far, more than 400,000 people have died of Covid in the United States, more than in any other country.</p><p>""We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation,"" he said, striking a new tone after Trump's mockery of mask-wearing and business closings meant to halt the virus.</p><p>While the public crowds were gone, Biden brought in celebrity power -- absent four years ago with Trump.</p><p>Lady Gaga, in a dress with a black bodice and a billowing red skirt, sang the national anthem and Jennifer Lopez gave a pop rendition of ""This Land is Your Land,"" ending by exclaiming the final words of the pledge of allegiance -- ""one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"" -- in Spanish.</p><p>The new first lady, Jill Biden, invited a 22-year-old poet, Amanda Gorman, who became a star of the day with verse on how democracy ""can never be permanently defeated.""</p><p>In lieu of inaugural balls, Biden joined a prime-time television broadcast from the Lincoln Memorial that featured Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, a number of Broadway stars and Justin Timberlake -- some live at the monument, but many of them appearing from remote locations.</p><p>Biden and Harris started their administration by jointly paying respects to fallen soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery followed by an inaugural parade -- without spectators -- that featured both an Army fife and drum corps in the red coats of George Washington's time, and a drumline and dancers from Howard University, the historically Black institution that counts the new vice president as a graduate.</p><p></p><hl2>- Trump vows to be back -</hl2><p></p><p>Trump left Washington hours before the inauguration, walking on a red carpet on the White House lawn with his wife Melania into the Marine One presidential helicopter, which flew near the inauguration-ready Capitol before heading to Andrews Air Force Base.</p><p>""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters at a campaign-style event with cannons before leaving for his Florida resort in his last trip on Air Force One.</p><p>""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.</p><p>In a first hint of graciousness, Trump wished the next administration ""great luck and great success"" -- without saying Biden's name.</p><p>Biden said that Trump left him a traditional letter that was ""very generous"" but declined to reveal the contents.</p><p>In the middle of his last night at the White House, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 73 people including close allies and lifted a ban on his administration's officials serving as lobbyists -- an order he had issued at the start of his presidency as he vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington.</p><p>bur-sct/sst</p><p></p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

A story of decency and dignity, love and healing and goodness.""</p><p>But Trump, who falsely said that he was cheated out of a second term and egged on his supporters before their rampage at the Capitol, broke 152 years of tradition by refusing to attend his successor's inauguration.</p><p>Biden pushed through a flurry of orders the moment he entered the White House, starting with rejoining the 2015 Paris climate accord, from which the United States was the sole outlier after a withdrawal by Trump, an ally of the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>""We are going to combat climate change in a way we have not done so far,"" the new US leader said in the Oval Office as he signed papers to rejoin the Paris deal, which was negotiated by Barack Obama when Biden was his vice president.</p><p>Biden also halted the US exit from the World Health Organization, rescinded a ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority nations and halted construction of Trump's cherished wall on the Mexican border.</p><p></p><hl2>- 'President for all Americans' -</hl2><p></p><p>In his inaugural address, Biden appealed to supporters of Trump, who shattered political norms by ruthlessly belittling rivals, denouncing entire ethnic groups and trying to cast doubt on basic facts.</p><p>""I will be a president for all Americans,"" the veteran Democrat said.</p><p>But Biden confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as evidenced during Trump's presidency by the Capitol mob, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants, and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>The United States faces ""a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat,"" Biden said.</p><p>""Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear and demonization have long torn us apart.""</p><p>At 78, Biden is the oldest-ever US president, a job he first sought in 1987. He is only the second Roman Catholic president after John F Kennedy and swore his oath on a bulging old family Bible. </p><p>Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history, and the first Black person and first person of Asian heritage as the nation's number two. </p><p>She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever ""second gentleman"" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who was seen luring the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers in a video that went viral.</p><p></p><hl2>- Empty Washington -</hl2><p></p><p>Central Washington took on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat of the January 6 violence. </p><p>With the public essentially barred from attending due to the pandemic, Biden's audience at the National Mall instead was 200,000 flags planted to represent the absent crowds.</p><p>Biden, who has vowed a major escalation in the nation's Covid vaccination drive, warned that the ""toughest and deadliest period"" was still ahead. </p><p>So far, more than 400,000 people have died of Covid in the United States, more than in any other country.</p><p>""We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation,"" he said, striking a new tone after Trump's mockery of mask-wearing and business closings meant to halt the virus.</p><p>While the public crowds were gone, Biden brought in celebrity power -- absent four years ago with Trump.</p><p>Lady Gaga, in a dress with a black bodice and a billowing red skirt, sang the national anthem and Tom Hanks prepared to host a televised evening appearance with the new president.</p><p>Jennifer Lopez sang a pop rendition of ""This Land is Your Land,"" often considered the unofficial US national anthem, ending it by exclaiming the final words of the pledge of allegiance -- ""one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"" -- in Spanish.</p><p>The new first lady, Jill Biden, invited a 22-year-old poet, Amanda Gorman, who became a star of the day with verse on how democracy ""can never be permanently defeated.""</p><p>Biden and Harris started their administration by jointly paying respects to fallen soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery followed by an inaugural parade -- devoid of the usual crowds -- that featured both an Army fife and drum corps in the red coats of George Washington's time, and a drumline and dancers from Howard University, the historically Black institution that counts the new vice president as a graduate.</p><p></p><hl2>- Trump vows to be back -</hl2><p></p><p>Trump left Washington hours before the inauguration, walking on a red carpet on the White House lawn with his wife Melania into the Marine One presidential helicopter, which flew near the inauguration-ready Capitol before heading to Andrews Air Force Base.</p><p>""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters at a campaign-style event with cannons before leaving for his Florida resort in his last trip on Air Force One.</p><p>""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.</p><p>In a first hint of graciousness, Trump wished the next administration ""great luck and great success"" -- without saying Biden's name.</p><p>Biden said that Trump left him a traditional letter that was ""very generous"" but declined to reveal the contents.</p><p>Mike Pence, the outgoing vice president who clashed with Trump in his final days by acknowledging he could not overturn the election, attended the inauguration and was spotted laughing with Harris.</p><p>Also taking part were former presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and their wives -- including Hillary Clinton, for whom Biden's victory was especially sweet four years after her narrow, surprise defeat to Trump.</p><p>In the middle of his last night at the White House, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 73 people including his former campaign chief Steve Bannon, who was charged with defrauding donors who thought they were building Trump's wall.</p><p>Trump in a final act lifted a ban on his administration's officials working as lobbyists -- an order he had issued at the start of his presidency as he vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington.</p><p>bur-sct/sst</p><p></p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

Since then, ERC has relinquished support for a unilateral break from Madrid and pushed for dialogue with the Sanchez government.</p><p>""We will begin talks today,"" Aragones said on Monday, ahead of tough negotiations with his potential partners who advocate a confrontational line with Madrid. </p><p></p><hl2>- Won't be easy -</hl2><p></p><p>""Their relationship isn't great and it will be complicated because they have contradicting aims,"" Barbet said.</p><p>Even though Sanchez's hope of dislodging the separatists from power didn't come off, the outcome is ""good news for the Spanish government"", said political analyst Josep Ramoneda.</p><p>On the one hand, Madrid will have a easier partner in Barcelona, while on the other, the outcome ""grants legitimacy to the government's policy"" of dialogue, he said. </p><p>This will give Sanchez room to tackle the Catalan issue and make gestures such as pardoning nine separatist leaders who were jailed for their role in the 2017 crisis in which the region held a banned referendum and briefly declared independence.</p><p>Since the end of January, the prisoners have benefited from a semi-open regime allowing them to work on weekdays and spend weekends at home, privileges which were overturned by Spain's top court late last year. </p><p>Despite the willingness on both sides to engage in dialogue, their positions remain far apart and difficult to reconcile, with Aragones already calling for a referendum on self-determination that has been firmly ruled out by Madrid. </p><p>dbh/hmw/ds/ach </p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

attempts to redirect power to occupied areas was ""unacceptable"".</p><p>Britain's defence ministry said satellite imagery showed an increased presence of Russian troops at the power plant with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60 metres (200 feet) of one reactor.</p><p>In another development Friday, French energy firm TotalEnergies said it was divesting its stake in a Russian gas field following a media report that some of its fuel was ending up in Russian fighter jets.</p><p>The company said it had signed a deal Friday with its local Russian partner Novatek to sell its 49 percent in the Termokarstovoye gas field ""on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field"".</p><p>It said the divestment had been agreed in July and Russian authorities gave the approval on August 25.</p><p>A day earlier, French daily Le Monde had reported the alleged refining of natural gas condensates from Termokarstovoye into jet fuel for fighter-bombers involved in Russia's assault on Ukraine.</p><p>TotalEnergies is the only major Western energy group to continue its operations in Russia but chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said in March Russian gas fields exploited by the company's joint ventures were vital for supplying energy to Europe.</p><p>Also Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's office said he would visit Germany next week for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that are expected to focus on Europe's energy crisis.</p><p>Germany is hugely dependent on Russian gas and Scholz says an Iberian

at and see as a profound threat.""</p><p>Last week, The Washington Post quoted anonymous Western intelligence officials as saying that Russia ""plans to use the satellite for several months or longer"" to assist its war efforts before allowing Iran to take control.</p><p>Less than two hours after the satellite was launched on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket, the Iran Space Agency (ISA) said ""ground stations of the Iran Space Agency"" had already received ""first telemetric data"". </p><p>The space agency stressed on Sunday that the Islamic republic would control the satellite ""from day one"" in an apparent reaction to the Post's report.</p><p>""No third country is able to access the information"" sent by the satellite due to its ""encrypted algorithm"", it said.</p><p>The purpose of Khayyam

ambitions.</p><p>The United States -- which quit the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump -- has accused Iran of effectively supporting Russia's war against Ukraine while adopting a ""veil of neutrality"".</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin met Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran last month -- one of his few trips abroad since Moscow's February 24 invasion. </p><p>Iran's Khamenei called for ""long-term cooperation"" with Russia during their meeting, and Tehran has refused to join international condemnation of Moscow's invasion of its pro-Western neighbour.</p><p>Iran insists its space programme is for civilian and defence purposes only, and does not breach the 2015 nuclear deal, or any other international agreement. </p><p>Western governments worry that satellite launch systems incorporate technologies interchangeable with those used in ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, something Iran has always denied wanting to build.</p><p>Iran successfully put its first military satellite into orbit in April 2020, drawing a sharp rebuke from the United States.</p><p>Borisov, who last month replaced bombastic nationalist Dmitry Rogozin as head of the Russian space agency, had acknowledged that the national space industry is in a ""difficult situation"" amid tensions with the West.</p><p>Russia will continue its space programme but end activities at the International Space Station -- an outlier of cooperation between Moscow

""For me it's another motivation that supports me and helps me to focus my mind on the job in hand.""</p><p>Nearby, Chekh's comrades sit under the forest canopy smoking and swapping stories as they take a break from digging trenches, their main job while the pause in fighting continues.</p><p>Around 150 civilians have died in the war in the Sumy region, its 39-year-old governor Dmytro Zhyvytsky told AFP.</p><p>The towns and villages along its 564-kilometre border with Russia are still experiencing almost daily bombardment by Grad rockets, howitzers and mortars, he said.</p><p>But for now, at least, the 10th Battalion's part of the frontline seems oddly peaceful.</p><p>On the short trek through dense woodland to get to the new frontline, there is no crackle of gunfire or the familiar boom of exploding shells that tightens the throat and quickens the blood.  </p><p>In a moment of unintentional comedy, the air vibrates with a cacophonous wail that sounds like a warrior's battle cry -- but then a snare drum kicks in and it's obvious that it's just someone's ringtone. </p><p></p><hl2>- Role model -</hl2><p></p><p>The laconic company commander, Captain Roman, oversees the excavation of the new trench, hands joined formally behind his back as if on a parade ground rather than a mound of mud.</p><p>He scans the treeline, eyes narrowing, looking for signs of movement from the enemy that never come.</p><p>""They shoot artillery and grenades from time to time and there is always the odd single shot,"" the 43-year-old tells AFP, almost apologetically.</p><p>Around 90 percent of the fighters in the 10th Battalion are volunteers who have seen little or no combat, but their commanding officers say that what they lack in experience, they make up for in heart. </p><p>""We are here to defend our country,"" Roman tells AFP. ""The soldiers know they can die, but they are ready to fulfil their task -- to defend Ukraine.""</p><p>Down below, platoon commander Lieutenant Volodymyr proudly shows off the new trench -- apparently a labour of love -- as he explains his motivation for volunteering.</p><p>An administrative worker at Lviv's polytechnic in another life, the 43-year-old quit his job and signed up because he wants to be a role model for his two sons.</p><p>He has thought about the effect that his death in combat would have on 12 and 16-year-old boys, but he argues that his valour would also set them a good example.</p><p>""If I'd stayed in Lviv doing nothing, what example would that be to my sons about being patriotic to Ukraine?""</p><p>ft/jbr/imm</p></body.content></nitf>"

Truth. Courage. Resilience,"" Biden said in a statement.</p><p>Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon. Police provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.</p><p></p><hl2>- Effective death sentence -</hl2><p></p><p>The 75-year-old novelist had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran's then-supreme leader Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.</p><p>The fatwa followed the publication of the novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" which enraged some Muslims who said it was blasphemous for its portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.</p><p>In a recent interview with Germany's Stern magazine, Rushdie spoke of how, after so many years living with death threats, his life was ""getting back to normal.""</p><p>""For whatever it was, eight or nine years, it was quite serious,"" he told a Stern correspondent in New York.</p><p>""But ever since I've been living in America, since the year 2000, really there hasn't been a problem in all that time.""</p><p>Rushdie moved to New York in the early 2000s and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.</p><p>Security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community near Buffalo.</p><p>Witnesses said Rushdie was seated on stage and preparing to speak when Matar sprang up from the audience and managed to stab him before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators.</p><p>Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.</p><p>An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there. </p><p>Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.</p><p>Matar was ""born and raised in the US,"" the head of the local municipality, Ali Qassem Tahfa, told AFP.</p><p></p><hl2>- Outrage -</hl2><p></p><p>""The Satanic Verses"" and its author remain deeply inflammatory in Iran. When asked by AFP on Saturday, nobody in Tehran's main book market dared to openly condemn the stabbing.</p><p>""I was very happy to hear the news,"" said Mehrab Bigdeli, a man in his 50s studying to become a Muslim cleric.</p><p>The message was similar in Iran's conservative media, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""</p><p>In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan, a party that has staged violent protests, said Rushdie ""deserved to be killed.""</p><p>Elsewhere there was shock and outrage.</p><p>British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack ""reprehensible"" and ""cowardly.""</p><p>Messages also flooded in from the literary world, with Rushdie's close friend Ian McEwan calling him an ""inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world.""</p><p>Rushdie was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel, ""Midnight's Children,"" in 1981, which won international praise for its portrayal of post-independence India.</p><p>But ""The Satanic Verses"", published in 1988, transformed his life. The resulting fatwa forced him into nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell even his children where he lived.</p><p>bur/bbk-sst/bfm/sw/ser</p><p><org>THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY</org></p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

His average approval rating has been stuck below 40 percent since late June, making him as unpopular as Trump before him.</p><p>Add in redistricting of House seats that was widely believed to favor the Republicans -- effectively almost guaranteeing them several extra seats -- and Republican party leaders were predicting a ""red wave"" to sweep ""blue"" Democrats away.</p><p>Now there's giddy talk on the left of a blue riptide washing back in the other direction.</p><p>The average of baseline polls asking which party should control Congress has shifted from months where Republicans led to a narrow 44-43.6 percent advantage for Democrats.</p><p>In the individual races, there are also glimmers of hope for Biden's party. A Democrat won Wednesday in a special election in a House swing district in New York -- exactly the kind of district Republicans would expect to flip in a red wave.</p><p>The Senate, which Democrats currently only control with one vote, was also thought to be trending Republican, but even Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell says that's now a 50-50 proposition.</p><p>""I think there's probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate,"" McConnell  said.</p><p>The veteran insider cited the ""quality"" of his party's Senate candidates.

United States drone strike killed Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri at a hideout in Kabul, President Joe Biden said Monday, declaring ""justice had been delivered"" to the families of the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>Zawahiri's assassination is the biggest blow to Al-Qaeda since US special forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, and calls into question the Taliban's promise not to harbour militant groups.</p><p>It was the first known over-the-horizon strike by the US on a target in Afghanistan since Washington withdrew its forces from the country on August 31 last year, days after the Taliban swept back to power.</p><p>The Taliban condemned the drone strike Tuesday, but made no mention of casualties nor did they name Zawahiri.</p><p>""Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said in a sombre televised address, adding he hoped Zawahiri's death would bring ""closure"" to families of the 3,000 people killed in the US on September 11, 2001.</p><p>Zawahiri was believed to be the mastermind who steered Al-Qaeda's operations -- including the 9/11 attacks -- as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.</p><p>A senior administration official said the 71-year-old Egyptian was on the balcony of a three-storey house in the Afghan capital when targeted with two Hellfire missiles after dawn Sunday.</p><p>""We identified Zawahiri on multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony where he was ultimately struck,"" the official said. </p><p>The house is in Sherpur, one of Kabul's most affluent neighbourhoods, with several villas occupied by high-ranking Taliban officials and commanders.</p><p>The Taliban's interior ministry previously denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in Kabul, causing no casualties.</p><p>Early Tuesday, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out.</p><p>""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first,"" he said.</p><p>""The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones.""</p><p></p><hl2>- 'Grossly violated' -</hl2><p></p><p>Although Biden did not mention the Taliban in his televised address, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""by hosting and sheltering"" Zawahiri, the Islamist group had ""grossly violated the Doha Agreement"" which paved the way for America's withdrawal.</p><p>Zabihullah, in turn, accused Washington of breaking the 2020 deal.</p><p>""Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan, and the region,"" he said.</p><p>Zawahiri, who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run since the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>He took over Al-Qaeda after bin Laden was killed, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.</p><p>News of his death comes a month before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the hands of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces for two decades.</p><p>Under the Doha deal, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke ties with Al-Qaeda.</p><p>""What we know is that the senior Haqqani Taliban were aware of his presence in Kabul,"" the senior US official said. </p><p>Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani also heads the feared Haqqani Network, a brutal subset of the Taliban blamed for some of the worst violence of the past 20 years and which has been described by US officials as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence.</p><p>In Sherpur, locals told AFP they long thought the targeted house  -- surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, and now with green tarpaulin covering the balcony where Zawahiri was believed to have been killed -- was empty.</p><p>""We have not seen anybody living there for almost a year,"" said an employee of a nearby office.</p><p>""It has always been in dark, with not a single bulb lit.""</p><p>Some residents found it hard to believe that Zawahiri had been hiding in their midst.</p><p>""It's just propaganda,"" Fahim Shah, 66, told AFP.</p><p>""They should show to the people and to the world that 'we had hit this man and here is the evidence,'"" added Abdul Kabir.</p><p></p><hl2>- Doctor turned jihadist -</hl2><p></p><p>Zawahiri lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.</p><p>Still, the group is believed to have been degraded since the US invasion of Afghanistan, and the White House official said Zawahiri was ""one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of significance"".</p><p>The organisation is ""at a crossroads"", said Soufan Center researcher Colin Clarke. </p><p>""Despite Zawahiri's leadership, which minimised AQ's losses while rebuilding, the group still faces serious challenges going forward. For one, there's the question of who will lead Al-Qaeda after Zawahiri's gone.""</p><p>Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.</p><p>He became involved with Egypt's radical Islamist community at a young age and published several books which came for many to symbolise the movement.</p><p>He left Egypt in the mid-1980s, heading for Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar where the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based.</p><p>Thousands of Islamist fighters were flooding into Afghanistan at the time, setting the stage for Zawahiri's first meeting with bin Laden. </p><p>In 1998 he became one of five signatories to bin Laden's ""fatwa"" calling for attacks against Americans.</p><p>Jihadist monitor SITE said some militants were questioning the veracity of the report he had been killed, while others believed Zawahiri had achieved his desire of ""martyrdom.""</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid welcomed the news of his killing.</p><p>""Terrorist groups and their sponsors must know: You're living on borrowed time. The forces of freedom will bring you to justice,"" he tweeted.</p><p>sms-pmh-st-fox/ecl/jd</p><p></p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

United States drone strike killed Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri at a hideout in Kabul, President Joe Biden said Monday, declaring ""justice had been delivered"" to the families of the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>Zawahiri's assassination is the biggest blow to Al-Qaeda since US special forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, and calls into question the Taliban's promise not to harbour militant groups.</p><p>It was the first known over-the-horizon strike by the US on a target in Afghanistan since Washington withdrew its forces from the country on August 31 last year, days after the Taliban swept back to power.</p><p>The Taliban condemned the drone strike Tuesday, but made no mention of casualties nor did they name Zawahiri.</p><p>""Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said in a sombre televised address, adding he hoped Zawahiri's death would bring ""closure"" to families of the 3,000 people killed in the US on September 11, 2001.</p><p>Zawahiri was believed to be the mastermind who steered Al-Qaeda's operations -- including the 9/11 attacks -- as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.</p><p>A senior administration official said the 71-year-old Egyptian was on the balcony of a three-storey house in the Afghan capital when targeted with two Hellfire missiles after dawn Sunday.</p><p>""We identified Zawahiri on multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony where he was ultimately struck,"" the official said. </p><p>The house is in Sherpur, one of Kabul's most affluent neighbourhoods, with several villas occupied by high-ranking Taliban officials and commanders.</p><p>The Taliban's interior ministry previously denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in Kabul, causing no casualties.</p><p>Early Tuesday, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out.</p><p>""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first,"" he said.</p><p>""The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones.""</p><p></p><hl2>- 'Grossly violated' -</hl2><p></p><p>Although Biden did not mention the Taliban in his televised address, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""by hosting and sheltering"" Zawahiri, the Islamist group had ""grossly violated the Doha Agreement"" which paved the way for America's withdrawal.</p><p>Zabihullah, in turn, accused Washington of breaking the 2020 deal.</p><p>""Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan, and the region,"" he said.</p><p>Zawahiri, who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run since the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>He took over Al-Qaeda after bin Laden was killed, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.</p><p>News of his death comes a month before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the hands of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces for two decades.</p><p>Under the Doha deal, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke ties with Al-Qaeda.</p><p>""What we know is that the senior Haqqani Taliban were aware of his presence in Kabul,"" the senior US official said. </p><p>Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani also heads the feared Haqqani Network, a brutal subset of the Taliban blamed for some of the worst violence of the past 20 years and which has been described by US officials as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence.</p><p>In Sherpur, locals told AFP they long thought the targeted house  -- surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, and now with green tarpaulin covering the balcony where Zawahiri was believed to have been killed -- was empty.</p><p>""We have not seen anybody living there for almost a year,"" said an employee of a nearby office.</p><p>""It has always been in dark, with not a single bulb lit.""</p><p>Some residents found it hard to believe that Zawahiri had been hiding in their midst.</p><p>""It's just propaganda,"" Fahim Shah, 66, told AFP.</p><p>""They should show to the people and to the world that 'we had hit this man and here is the evidence,'"" added Abdul Kabir.</p><p></p><hl2>- Doctor turned jihadist -</hl2><p></p><p>Zawahiri lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.</p><p>Still, the group is believed to have been degraded since the US invasion of Afghanistan, and the White House official said Zawahiri was ""one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of significance"".</p><p>The organisation is ""at a crossroads"", said Soufan Center researcher Colin Clarke. </p><p>""Despite Zawahiri's leadership, which minimised AQ's losses while rebuilding, the group still faces serious challenges going forward. For one, there's the question of who will lead Al-Qaeda after Zawahiri's gone.""</p><p>Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.</p><p>He became involved with Egypt's radical Islamist community at a young age and published several books which came for many to symbolise the movement.</p><p>He left Egypt in the mid-1980s, heading for Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar where the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based.</p><p>Thousands of Islamist fighters were flooding into Afghanistan at the time, setting the stage for Zawahiri's first meeting with bin Laden. </p><p>In 1998 he became one of five signatories to bin Laden's ""fatwa"" calling for attacks against Americans.</p><p>Jihadist monitor SITE said some militants were questioning the veracity of the report he had been killed, while others believed Zawahiri had achieved his desire of ""martyrdom."" </p><p>sms-pmh-st-fox/ecl/dhc</p><p></p></body.content></nitf>"

The risks of things going wrong were high, bin Laden had not been clearly identified, and relations with Pakistan could suffer, he later recalled.</p><p>With Zawahiri, however, no US troops would enter the country; Zawahiri was clearly identified; and relations with the Taliban were next to nil. </p><p>At the end of the discussion on the 25th, Biden -- as Obama had done 11 years earlier -- asked each participant for their view.</p><p>""All strongly recommended approval of this target,"" and Biden gave the go-ahead, the official said.</p><p>The strike involved a US drone, armed with two precision-guided Hellfire missiles, which were launched at 6:18 am Sunday, Kabul time.</p><p>Zawahiri was ""killed on the balcony,"" the official said.</p><p>The missiles appear not to have been ordinary Hellfires, whose high explosives could have destroyed the home.</p><p></p><hl2>- 'Significant blow to Al-Qaeda' -</hl2><p></p><p>Apparent photographs of the building show only a few windows on one floor blown out, and the rest intact.</p><p>That points to the likely use of a non-explosive version of the Hellfire, the R9X, which deploys a series of knife-like blades from its fuselage and shreds its target but leaves nearby people and objects intact. </p><p>The so-called ""flying ginsu"" missile has been used a half-dozen or more times by US forces to kill other jihadist group leaders without hurting bystanders.</p><p>The official did not provide details, but expressed strong confidence that Zawahiri had been killed and no others were hurt. </p><p>""Zawahiri's family members were present in other parts of the safe house at the time of the strike and were purposely not targeted and were not harmed,"" he said.</p><p>The official said the strike ""deals a significant blow to Al-Qaeda and will degrade the group's ability to operate.""</p><p>""As President Biden has consistently said, we will not allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists who might bring harm to Americans,"" the official said.</p><p>pmh/des</p></body.content></nitf>"
