Hollywood's acting union nominated Boseman for his lead role as an ambitious young horn player in 1920s blues drama ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" and his supporting role as a Vietnam War soldier in Spike Lee's ""Da 5 Bloods.""  Both films also scored nominations for best cast -- the top prize at the SAG ceremony, which like much of the Tinseltown awards calendar has been delayed by the pandemic.  Although less high-profile than the Golden Globes nominations a day earlier, the SAG awards are seen as a stronger indicator of Oscars glory, since actors represent the largest branch of the roughly 10,000 voters for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.   Only two actors have ever posthumously won Oscars -- Peter Finch for 1976's ""Network,"" and Heath Ledger for 2008's ""The Dark Night."" Boseman died at age 43 in August last year from colon cancer, a diagnosis he never publicly discussed.  Boseman's co-star Viola Davis also earned a lead actress nod for ""Ma Rainey,"" putting it joint-top of the SAG film acting nominations with Korean-American drama ""Minari.""  ""Minari,"" which follows an immigrant family who move to 1980s rural Arkansas to scrape together a new life, is hoping to emulate ""Parasite"" -- which won last year's SAG best cast prize before ultimately being named the Oscars best picture.  Former ""Walking Dead"" favorite Steven Yeun and veteran South Korean star Youn Yuh-jung were both recognized for the film, along with the ensemble cast.  Rounding out the prestigious best cast category were a pair of 1960s-set civil rights movies: ""One Night in Miami"" and courtroom drama ""The Trial of the Chicago 7.""  Unlike other top Hollywood ceremonies, the SAG awards also honor the year's best stunt work.  ""Da 5 Bloods"" and ""Chicago 7"" landed stunt nominations, alongside Disney's ""Mulan,"" Tom Hanks-starring western ""News of the World,"" and superhero movie ""Wonder Woman 1984.""  Netflix again dominated the film nominations with 11 acting nods and a further two for stunt work. Rival streamer Amazon followed with four.  On the television side, ""The Crown"" and ""Schitt's Creek"" followed a strong showing at the Globes by topping the SAG nominations with five apiece.  The SAGs nominated several TV shows overlooked by the Globes, including Netflix mega-hit ""Bridgerton"" and acclaimed British drama ""I May Destroy You.""  The nominations were announced on Instagram Live by Daveed Diggs -- who earned a television acting nod for the Disney+ version of Broadway hit ""Hamilton"" -- and Lily Collins (""Emily in Paris."")   The 27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards were twice postponed, first by the pandemic and later by a clash with music's Grammys. They will now take place on April 4, followed by the Oscars on April 25.  amz/ft   NETFLIX    THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY    AMAZON.COM",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104218016']

Tears rolled down Biden's cheeks at a farewell ceremony in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where he paid tribute to his late son and rising politician Beau, before catching a plane to the capital.  ""I only have one regret, that he's not here,"" Biden said.  Trump, who has not appeared in public for a week, broke days of silence with a pre-recorded farewell video address.  Trump for the first time asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming Biden administration -- a change of tune from weeks spent persuading his huge number of Republican followers that the Democrat cheated in their election battle.  Trump has yet to personally congratulate Biden on his win or invite him for the customary cup of tea in the Oval Office.  In one of his last acts before he flies to Florida from Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday morning, Trump is expected to issue scores of pardons, with speculation rife over who might make the list.  The latest indications are that Trump will not take the legally dubious step of issuing himself and his children preemptive pardons.  Outside the White House fence, central Washington has taken on a dystopian look ahead of Biden's inauguration, swarming with National Guard troops and largely emptied of ordinary people.  Covid-19 restrictions meant the swearing-in ceremony at noon on Wednesday was always due to be sparsely attended. But fears of right-wing attacks in the wake of the pro-Trump riot in the Capitol building on January 6 have triggered unprecedented deployments of armed soldiers, concrete barriers and secure areas dubbed ""green"" and ""red"" zones.  Adding to the tension, the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.    - Biden comes to town -    Biden, a veteran Democratic senator who also served as vice president to Barack Obama, left for Washington with his wife Jill Biden.  They are staying in Blair House, a residence for heads of state and other important visitors just across the street from the White House.  Together with incoming vice president Kamala Harris -- the first woman ever to hold the job -- Biden first attended an evening memorial at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in honor the 400,000 Americans who have died so far from Covid-19.  ""To heal, we must remember. It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" he said.  Stretching up the Mall to the Capitol building, where Biden and Harris will be sworn in, the grassy area has been filled with some 200,000 American flags to represent the vast crowds that usually attend inaugurations.  Fifty-six pillars of light will beam up to represent the US states and territories.  Another eye-catching number is the more than 20,000 National Guards troops on duty, many of them carrying automatic rifles and dressed in full combat gear.  But Biden is coming in with a strong message of unity, insisting that he can bring a divided country back to the center and confront the nation's multiple crises, starting with Covid-19, together.  The inaugural speech will last between 20-30 minutes, according to a source familiar with preparations, and ""he will reach out to all Americans, and call on every citizen to be part of meeting the extraordinary challenges facing all of us,"" an advisor said, asking to remain unnamed.  To symbolize the new spirit, Biden has invited the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell -- and other top congressional leaders to attend a church service with him on Wednesday before the inauguration.  A person familiar with McConnell's plans confirmed to AFP the Republican congressional leader would join Biden, a longtime Senate colleague, in church.    - Pardons -    For Trump, the main piece of unfinished business is now the expected slew of pardons that he is reported to be preparing.  According to CNN and other US outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he will grant clemency to.  After what The New York Times reports has been an intense lobbying effort, these are expected to be a mix of white-collar criminals and people whose cases have been championed by criminal justice activists.  More controversial possible pardons that have been the subject of speculation for months would be for the likes of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Trump's influential advisor Steve Bannon.  But Trump has, according to latest US media reports, moved away from the temptation to issue himself a preemptive pardon. This would anger his Republican backers in the Senate right ahead of the start of the impeachment trial.  Although Trump was easily acquitted thanks to party support in his first impeachment last year, this time it may not go so well.  Senior Senate Republican McConnell said in blistering comments Tuesday that Trump had ""provoked"" his supporters and that the ""mob was fed lies"" before embarking on the assault against Congress.  sms/ft",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Flip the Senate.""  Voters in traditionally conservative Georgia head to the polls on Tuesday for two crucial Senate runoffs that will decide which party controls the upper chamber of the US Congress.  If the Democrats win both races, the balance of power will shift their way -- and a big turnout among Black voters is seen as the key to that success.  ""It is important that African Americans and minorities show up to the polls,"" Sukari Johnson, the Democratic Party chair in Clayton County, told AFP.  At the rally, which brought together young voters and families for a day of speeches and entertainment, many were given signs that read: ""Always Bet on Black.""  T-shirts, pins and bags were also distributed for free, and attendees asked to call three friends to get the message out. ""Vote"" is the word on everyone's lips.  ""A lot of people are hurting now since Covid, and are unemployed. And so if you want anything to change, we have to elect"" Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Johnson said.  As Ossoff himself puts it, ""the Democratic standardbearers are the young Jewish son of an immigrant mentored by John Lewis and a Black pastor who holds Dr (Martin Luther) King's pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church.""    - 'I'm hopeful' -    Georgia, a state still marked by its segregationist past, was home to both King and late civil rights leader John Lewis, who passed away last year after a decades-long career in the US House of Representatives.  But the southern state has never elected a Black senator -- the 51-year-old Warnock would be the first -- and has not sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years.  So, Warnock and Ossoff, a 33-year-old documentary film producer, have a lot of political ground to make up. The party's hopes -- and those of President-elect Joe Biden -- are resting on their shoulders.  ""If we don't get them in, Biden won't be able to do much,"" Johnson says matter-of-factly.  If Ossoff defeats incumbent David Perdue, and Warnock bests sitting senator Kelly Loeffler, the Senate will be at a 50-50 split -- meaning incoming Vice President Kamala Harris would have the deciding vote.  That means Biden would have both chambers behind him, making it easier to push ahead with his agenda.  Biden's win in November energized Democratic voters in Georgia -- it was the first time since 1992 that the state chose a presidential candidate from that party.  Voters like 59-year-old teacher Mary Garrett believe a Democratic win is possible on Tuesday.  ""I'm hopeful,"" she said.    - Early voting -    More than three million voters in Georgia, out of the seven million registered, cast their ballots early -- a record for a runoff, but a lower number than seen at the same point in the presidential election.  Biden's win was due in part to anti-Trump Republicans and independents, some of whom may return to the GOP fold this time around.  Trey Hood, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, says Black voters are ""one of the biggest bases of supports for Democratic candidates in the state, so the Black turnout is pivotal.""  One out of every three of Georgia 10.6 million residents is African American. What has changed, according to Hood, is the increasing number of Blacks in the overall electorate. That figure is now at nearly 30 percent.    - 'Black Voters Matter' -    Rally organizers in Hampton wear masks that read ""Black Voters Matter"" -- a riff on the Black Lives Matter movement.  On the back of efforts by former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams, who has been credited with galvanizing the party in her home state, the party has worked on mitigating what were seen as obstacles to minority turnout: long waits, difficulties in registering to vote and voter ID woes.  In the rural town of Eatonton, Ossoff campaigned on Saturday, cruising in on his campaign bus. He spoke to a few dozen voters at a rally before they headed out to knock on doors and try to convince their neighbors.  ""Even as you're out there on the doors today, feel in your heart what we are fighting for: equal justice for all,"" he said to cheers from the modest crowd of both white and Black voters.  ""You have the power to make this happen.""   elc/sst/bgs","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

Tuesday's vote in a swing district in upstate New York was to choose a candidate to serve the final months of Democrat Antonio Delgado's term in the House of Representatives, after he quit to become the Empire State's lieutenant governor.  The battle for New York's 19th congressional district comes two months after the Supreme Court sparked nationwide protests by ending the federally guaranteed right to abortion.  Democrat Pat Ryan, who has sought to turn the vote into a referendum on abortion access, was projected to win, according to US media including NBC, ABC and Fox News.  ""Choice was on the ballot. Freedom was on the ballot, and tonight choice and freedom won,"" Ryan tweeted after he was forecast to triumph.  ""We voted like our democracy was on the line because it is. We upended everything we thought we knew about politics and did it together.""  He has accused Republican rival Marc Molinaro and his party, who are against such access, of being ""too extreme on women's rights.""  Ryan's victory ""sends a clear message that voters are fighting back against Republicans' extreme attacks on abortion rights,"" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Sean Patrick Maloney said in a statement quoted by NBC.  ""Republicans can say goodbye to their 'Red Wave' because voters are clearly coming out in force to elect a pro-choice majority to Congress this November.""  Molinaro, who had followed his party's main political talking points including on inflation and spiralling living costs, had refused to concede, The New York Times reported.  ""Whether it's tonight or it's Nov. 8, we are going to win the 19th Congressional District and give voice to people who are working too damn hard and getting too little in return,"" Molinaro told his supporters late Tuesday, the paper said.    - 'Right to choose on the ballot' -    President Joe Biden carried the district by fewer than two points in 2020, after Donald Trump took it by about seven points in 2016. Barack Obama won there in 2012.  Both candidates will be back on the ballot in November, but in different districts newly drawn in the latest round of redistricting.   The somewhat anachronistic system means Ryan -- who has yet to be nominated to fight for a seat in the midterms -- was on the ballot Tuesday in two districts for two separate seats for two different congresses.  New York also held several nominating contests -- known as primary elections -- including a vote pitting Democratic committee chairs Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney against one another.  Nadler handily won, taking 55.4 percent to 24.4 percent for Maloney with more than 95 percent of votes counted.  Maloney said she had congratulated Nadler on his win.  ""I share his progressive values. I wish him every success,"" she tweeted.  ""We must maintain a Democratic House and increase margins in the Senate to stop the extremists who are working to end our democracy,"" she added.  In Florida, Democrats picked congressman Charlie Crist as their candidate to challenge Governor Ron DeSantis in November.  ""Our fundamental freedoms are literally on the ballot, my friends,"" Crist said in his victory speech, vowing to end the White House hopes of DeSantis, who is tipped as a likely Republican hopeful in 2024.  ""A woman's right to choose on the ballot. Democracy on the ballot. Your rights as minorities are on this ballot,"" Crist said.  ""That's what's at stake in this election, make no mistake about it, because this guy wants to be president of the United States of America and everybody knows it.  ""However, when we defeat him on November 8, that show is over.""  US voters will decide control of Congress in the midterm elections, with all 435 House seats up for grabs, as well as 35 of the 100 Senate seats and the governor's mansion in 36 out of 50 states.  ft/mtp/aha",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112811646']

While most countries consider all Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal, Israel broadly divides them into two categories: government-recognised settlements and so-called wildcat outposts.   In the former, Israel aims to provide similar services -- water, electricity and the like -- as it does to citizens within its internationally agreed borders.  Wildcat settlements, often ramshackle collections of portacabins set up by hardline religious nationalists deep inside the West Bank, generally have no connection to the Israeli grid.  Some outposts have been given retrospective authorisation in the past, particularly by Netanyahu-led governments.  As another Israeli election nears, pro-settler groups are using tactics including a hunger strike outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem office to demand recognition for another 70 wildcat outposts, home to some 25,000 of the 650,000 settlers in east Jerusalem and the West Bank.  Yossi Dagan, an influential settler leader who staged a week-long protest fast outside the premier's office this month, insisted that distinguishing between types of settlements was ""absurd"".  ""There is no logical reason why 25,000 Israeli citizens do not have the same rights as others, it's not a political question, it's a question of social rights,"" he said.    - Limited 'wiggle room' -    Dagan, head of a regional council for Israeli settlements in the northern West Bank, fainted and was briefly hospitalised after speaking to AFP last week.  He had launched his hunger strike as former US president Donald Trump was about to leave office -- timing that experts suspect was far from coincidental.  Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967.   Both Republican and Democratic US administrations have long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory.   But Trump's staunchly pro-Israel administration broke with this policy, announcing in 2019 that it did not regard such activity as illegal.    Trump's four-year term saw an unprecedented boom in settlement construction and spared Netanyahu from Washington's traditional criticism in response to new West Bank housing projects.   President Joe Biden is set to restore Washington's opposition to settlements, so right-wing settlers are trying use the window before Israel's next election to secure firm commitments from Netanyahu -- who is desperate for their votes.   ""The settlers know that (with Biden in office) the government's wiggle room will not be as great as it was during Trump's tenure, so they need promises, not just statements of support"" from Israeli politicians, said Denis Charbit, a political scientist at the Open University of Israel.   Hagit Ofran, who monitors settlements for the Israeli anti-occupation group Peace Now, said Biden's presidency and Israel's election results could impact both wildcat settlement recognition and broader questions around the ""appropriation of Palestinian land"".    - Battle for the right -    Netanyahu partly owes his record as Israel's longest-serving premier, in power since 2009, to his status as the unchallenged leader of the Israeli right.   But polls suggest the March election, Israel's fourth is less than two years, could swing against him.  Gideon Saar, a leading right-winger with pro-settler credentials, defected from Netanyahu's Likud party last year, and polls suggest his breakaway party could win a solid chunk of seats in the parliament.  Surveys also suggest that the staunchly pro-settler Yemina party of Naftali Bennett, a former defence and economy minister, is on the rise.   Both Saar and Bennett have ruled out joining a Netanyahu-led coalition, which could complicate the premier's bid to forge a 61-seat majority -- something he already failed to do after three recent elections when the Likud was united behind him.   In Givat Hahish, a wildcat outpost near Bethlehem where some 40 families live in a mixture of mobile homes and permanent dwellings, father of four Matan Fingerhut declined to state his political preferences.   But he made clear that he wants political recognition of Givat Hahish.   ""I like this place and I want to live here legally,"" said Fingerhut, who built his own house on a hill without Israeli government permission.  He said he hoped recognition could lead to better services.   ""We often find ourselves in the dark, without heating, without hot water,"" he said.  Uriya Loberbaum, a 38-year-old father of five, recently staged an 18-day hunger strike in support of recognition for his wildcat settlement of Sde Boaz.   He dismisses the international consensus that the West Bank must form part of a future Palestinian state.    ""We have to make it clear that it is ours, this region belongs to the Jewish people,"" he said.  mib/scw/bs/par/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

Sadyr Japarov's journey from prison to presidential frontrunner is an example of the dramatic changes in political fortunes in the Central Asian country that is both more unpredictable and pluralistic than its authoritarian neighbours.  But critics of combative Japarov, 52, who became acting leader during the October unrest, fear his victory could tip Kyrgyzstan towards the strongman rule dominant in the ex-Soviet region.  Voters began trickling into polling stations in frosty conditions at 8:00 am (0200 GMT).   First results are expected shortly after polling stations close at 8:00 pm (1400 GMT).  In the capital Bishkek, where cold winters usher in a thick blanket of smog courtesy of polluting heating systems and ageing transport, many voters said they intended to back Japarov -- who was convicted for hostage-taking -- at the ballot box.  ""He has promised to raise salaries, pensions,"" said Vera Pavlova, 69, who admitted that she knew little about other candidates.  ""I haven't seen their posters anywhere. Only Japarov's.""   In addition to picking a new president Kyrgyz are choosing between parliamentary and presidential forms of government, with Japarov backing greater powers for the post he is seeking.    - Crime, corruption -    Japarov, who was sprung from jail by supporters during the crisis before a court overturned his conviction, has styled himself as an uncompromising opponent of organised crime and systemic corruption.  He has poured scorn on critics, some of whom have speculated that criminal networks are behind his rise to power.  But he struck a unifying tone in his last campaign appearance on Friday in Bishkek.  ""Let us come together... treat each other with understanding and respect. We are one country, one people,"" he told a crowd of several thousand people.  With a threadbare economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Kyrgyzstan's next leader is likely to be even more dependent on goodwill from allies Russia -- a destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrants -- and neighbouring economic giant China.  Russian President Vladimir Putin recently described the overthrow of the previous government as a ""misfortune"".  At his end of year press-conference Putin chided Kyrgyz politicians for attempting to imitate Western democracies.  Beijing's ambassador met with Kyrgyz officials several times last year to discuss protection for Chinese businesses, some of which were attacked during the unrest.    - Level playing field? -    Mountainous Kyrgyzstan's votes are more competitive than in its ex-Soviet neighbours, but they have rarely offered an even playing field.  The crisis that allowed for Japarov's overnight rehabilitation and rise to power was sparked by vote-buying campaigns favouring parties close to former president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.  Jeenbekov resigned less than two weeks later at the insistence of Japarov's supporters and after agreeing to sign off on Japarov's election as prime minister by parliament.  It was the third time a Kyrgyz head of state has stepped down over street protests since independence in 1991. Japarov also became acting president following the resignation.  While constitutional requirements saw Japarov abandon his positions to compete in Sunday's election, rivals complain that his campaign has benefited from the resources of the state, where his allies now occupy top posts.   Talant Mamytov, the pro-Japarov parliament speaker who inherited presidential powers from Japarov in the run up to the vote, cast his ballot on Sunday morning in Bishkek, an AFP correspondent saw.  On Friday the national security committee, headed by another Japarov ally, said it was investigating ""certain presidential candidates and their supporters"" planning unrest after the vote, but did not name the candidates.  Bekjol Nurmatov, a 77-year-old retiree, accused Japarov of ""plunging the people into chaos"" last year and complained his campaign was using ""administrative resources"" to win votes in the Osh region from which Nurmatov hails.      The pensioner noted that Japarov had failed to show up for televised debates between candidates. He said he would vote instead for presidential rival Adakhan Madumarov, also from the Osh region.   ""Madumarov is a worthy candidate, the retiree said, accusing frontrunner Japarov of ""hiding from the people.""  tol-cr/mtp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024']

Europe's largest nuclear facility was severed from Ukraine's power network for the first time in its history on Thursday due to ""actions of the invaders"", Energoatom said  As of 2:04 p.m. (1104 GMT) the plant ""is connected to the grid and produces electricity for the needs of Ukraine"" once again, it says.  Zaporizhzhia was seized by Russian troops early on in the war. In recent weeks, Kyiv and Moscow have blamed each other for rocket strikes around the facility in the southern Ukrainian city of Energodar.  ""Russia has put Ukrainians as well as all Europeans one step away from radiation disaster,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Thursday in his nightly address.  Kyiv suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.    - EU sets energy crisis talks -    The Czech presidency of the European Union says it will convene urgent talks to deal with the current energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Prime Minister Petr Fiala says on Twitter the meeting of the 27-nation bloc's energy ministers will ""discuss specific emergency measures to address the energy situation.""  The move comes as the EU is trying to shed dependence on supplies of Russian oil and gas following the Ukraine invasion.  ""We are in an energy war with Russia and it is damaging the whole EU,"" Czech Industry and Trade Minister Jozef Sikela says on Twitter, saying the meeting should take place ""at the earliest possible date"".  Reduced supplies and anxiety over the future have sparked rocket growth in energy prices across Europe. The announcement of the new meeting came as German and French electricity prices for 2023 soared to new records and EU members started to frame energy saving plans.    - Turkey meets Finland, Sweden on NATO bids -    Turkey says Sweden and Finland renewed their commitment to fight ""terror"" at the first meeting aimed at addressing Ankara's conditions for accepting their NATO membership bids.  ""Finland and Sweden have renewed their commitment to demonstrate full solidarity and cooperation with Turkey in the fight against all forms and manifestations of terror,"" said a statement from Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin, who attended the talks.   The two Nordic countries broke with decades-long military non-alignment and asked to join NATO after Russia's February invasion of Ukraine.   Their bids have already been ratified by the United States and more than half of the 30 members of NATO. Each application must win unanimous consent from member states.  Only Turkey, a NATO member since 1952, has opposed their applications, demanding the extradition of militants from outlawed groups including the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and people implicated in a failed 2016 Turkish coup.    - Firm divests from Russian gas field -    French energy company TotalEnergies says it is divesting its stake in a Russian gas field that was reported this week to be providing fuel that ends up in Russian fighter jets.  The firm said it had signed a deal with its local Russian partner Novatek to sell its 49 percent in the Termokarstovoye gas field ""on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field.""  burs-jmy/eab/cdw   TOTALENERGIES    NOVATEK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Israel said it launched a pre-emptive strike against Islamic Jihad, killing a top commander of the Palestinian militant group it blames for a series of recent attacks inside Israel.   Islamic Jihad said the Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"", hours before it unleashed what it said was an ""initial response"" of 100 rockets towards Israel.  There were no immediate reports of casualties inside Israel.   But in Gaza, a child was among those killed, according to the territory's health ministry, which is run by Islamist movement Hamas.   Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, most recently in May of last year. Islamic Jihad is a separate group, but aligned with Hamas.   The Israeli strikes were ongoing late Friday, targeting what the army described as militant targets across the territory it has blockaded since the Hamas takeover.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said the strikes were a ""precise counter-terror operation against an immediate threat"".     - Five-year-old girl -    Flames poured out of a building in Gaza City following the first round of strikes, while wounded Palestinians were evacuated by medics.  Gaza's health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among nine people killed. A further 55 Palestinians were wounded, the ministry said.  Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Islamic Jihad said several members of its military wing were among those killed, including ""the great fighter Taysir al-Jabari 'Abu Mahmoud', the commander of the Al-Quds Brigade in the northern region of the Gaza Strip.""  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  The spokesperson added that the military expected retaliatory rocket fire by Gaza militants, possibly deep into central Israel.   Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.  Islamic Jihad leader Ziad al-Nakhala, who is visiting key backer Iran, told Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen television that ""Tel Aviv will... be one of the targets of the resistance's missiles... as will all Zionist cities.""    - 'Pay the price' -    The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, which has a strong presence in Gaza. The militant group did not launch attacks on Israeli territory after the arrests.  Hamas, the militant group which rules Gaza, said Israel has ""committed a new crime for which it must pay the price"".  ""The resistance in all its military arms and factions is united in this struggle and will speak loudly... All fronts must open fire on the enemy,"" Hamas said in a statement.  Lapid, who was meeting with his security chiefs through the day, said: ""Anyone who tries to harm Israel should know -- we will find you. The security forces will act against Islamic Jihad terrorists to eliminate the threat they pose to the citizens of Israel.""  Islamic Jihad is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by the European Union and the United States.  The office of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said the Israeli military action amounted to a ""dangerous escalation"" and called on the international community to curb Israeli ""aggression.""  The Israeli military banned large gatherings in communities within 80 kilometres (50 miles) of the Gaza frontier until Saturday evening.   The measure follows four days of road closures and other restrictions on movement in the border area.  Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.  Gaza's only power station is at risk of imminent outage due to a lack of fuel supplies through Israel, its manager warned on Thursday.  This week's shutdown of the border area follows a raid by security forces in the northern West Bank district of Jenin.  Israeli forces detained Bassem al-Saadi and another senior member of Islamic Jihad. A 17-year-old member of the group was shot dead by Israeli forces during the raid.  bur-rsc/bs/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The company said that it had signed a deal on Friday with its local Russian partner Novatek to sell its 49 percent in the Termokarstovoye gas field ""on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field.""  It said the divestment had been agreed in July and submitted to Russian authorities in early August, with approval coming on August 25.  That was the day after an article appeared in French daily Le Monde reporting the alleged refining of natural gas condensates from Termokarstovoye into jet fuel for fighter-bombers involved in Russia's assault on Ukraine since February.  TotalEnergies -- formerly Total -- owns 49 percent of Terneftegaz, the company that extracts gas from the Termokarstovoye field.  The other 51 percent is held by Novatek, in which the French firm also holds a 19.4 percent stake.  Le Monde reported Wednesday that condensates from Termokarstovoye were being sent to a refinery that had provided 42,700 tonnes of fuel from February-July sent to airbases hosting Russian planes.  Citing data from financial information firm Refinitiv, it said the shipments could be tracked back to the by-products from Termokarstovoye.  TotalEnergies initially said it had no control over the sales of its Russian partner.  On Friday, it said Novatek had denied that its condensates were being refined into Russian military jet fuel.  Instead, they were sent to processing at a refinery whose products are exclusively exported outside Russia, a Novatek statement relayed by the French firm said.  TotalEnergies also said it was considering legal action in a bid to end an ""unfounded controversy which is damaging the reputation of the company.""

The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing index was at 58.7 percent in January, less than analysts had forecast but nonetheless above the 50-percent reading indicating expansion for the eighth straight month after the sector plunged as the pandemic began.  The softening has contributed to a decline in both new orders and production, but employment continued to recover even as factories complained the virus complicated operations.  ""Survey committee members reported that their companies and suppliers continue to operate in reconfigured factories, but absenteeism, short-term shutdowns to sanitize facilities and difficulties in returning and hiring workers are continuing to cause strains that limit manufacturing growth potential,"" the survey's chairman Timothy Fiore said.  New orders dropped 6.4 points to 61.1 percent, while production lost four points to hit 60.7 percent. Prices saw a big jump to 82.1 percent, their highest level since April 2011 as manufacturers paid more for the raw materials they required.  Employment, which was hard-hit as the pandemic caused businesses to shut down or modify operations, climbed modestly to 52.6 percent.  Of 18 manufacturing sectors surveyed, only two, the printing and coal and petroleum industries, reported contraction last month.  Manufacturers are optimistic about the future as Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out across the United States, with ISM reporting three positive comments for each cautious comment received.  ""Manufacturing sector prospects for 2021 are upbeat, with solid consumer goods demand, inventory restocking, gradual business reopenings and additional federal pandemic relief all set to keep activity on a firm footing,"" Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics said in an analysis.

""We propose holding an international, ministerial-level meeting in spring-summer 2021,"" Lavrov told a UN Security Council meeting about the Middle East held by videoconference.

By a lopsided vote of 81-13, well more than the two-thirds of the 100-member chamber required, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the $740.5 billion National Defense Authorization Act to fund the military for fiscal 2021.   The Democratic-led House of Representatives had voted 322 to 87 on Monday to override Trump's veto.   Both houses of Congress had easily passed the legislation in early December by strong majorities, but Trump, citing a litany of objections, vetoed it on December 23.  ""It's time for us to deliver this bill,"" Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said at the start of Friday's session.   ""It's our chance to remind brave servicemembers and their families that we have their backs.""  The vote completed a stunning rebuke in the waning weeks of Trump's presidency.   It came in an extraordinary New Year's Day session necessitated by his veto, possibly the final act of the outgoing Congress.   New members will be sworn in on Sunday, just 17 days before Democrat Joe Biden is inaugurated to succeed Trump.    - Trump's complaints -    Breaking with members of his party, Trump had criticized the defense bill on numerous grounds.  He called it a ""gift"" to China and Russia and said it restricted his ability to lower troop numbers in Afghanistan, South Korea and elsewhere.  Trump had bristled at language to rename military installations that currently honor leaders of the breakaway Civil War-era Confederacy.   He also insisted the bill should include a repeal of a federal law, known as Section 230, that provides liability protection to internet companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, which he regularly accuses of anti-conservative bias.  ""Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies,"" Trump tweeted after the vote. ""Pathetic!!!""  Referring to the Senate's refusal to vote first on a motion to increase pandemic aid checks, he added, ""Now they want to give people ravaged by the China Virus $600, rather than the $2000 which they so desperately need,"" using a term he applies to the coronavirus that has been widely decried as racist and fanning conspiracy theories.  But members of the president's own Republican Party -- which traditionally prides itself as strong on defense -- underscored the importance of the bill.  ""It's absolutely vital to our national security and our troops,"" said Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  ""Our men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform shouldn't be denied what they need -- ever.""  Democrats in both chambers had slammed Trump's veto. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it ""an act of recklessness.""  Senator Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said Friday on the Senate floor that the bill was ""essential"" in bolstering the nation's cybersecurity against the type of widespread targeted attack that recently hit both the government and some private companies.  As to Trump's remark that Moscow and Beijing might approve of the bill, Reed said that any such suggestion was ""completely baseless.""  On the Senate floor Friday, Inhofe and Reed repeatedly congratulated each other for their months-long collaboration on the sweeping bill -- a rare instance of cross-aisle cooperation in the deeply divided Congress.  bbk/sst/to/acb","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

The incident on the flight out of Denver -- which quickly returned to the airport after part of the engine caught fire and broke off -- prompted United and other airlines to ground the planes with the same Pratt & Whitney engine.  While no one was injured in the Denver incident, the episode is the latest setback for Boeing, which only recently resumed deliveries of the long-grounded 737 MAX following two fatal crashes of that plane.  Shares of Boeing shook off early weakness Monday as aviation experts said the incident mostly raised pointed questions about Pratt & Whitney and United over engine maintenance.  ""It's nothing like the MAX,"" said Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia. ""After all these years of service it is unlikely to be a design issue with the engine, certainly it is something to do with maintenance.""  Boeing said all 128 of the 777 models with Pratt & Whitney engines were grounded following Saturday's emergency landing of United flight 328 to Hawaii.   ""I have just had confirmation that all the 777s equipped with this engine have been grounded,"" a spokeswoman for the planemaker told AFP in a text message on Monday.   And British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a temporary ban on jets with Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 series engines from entering UK airspace.  ""I will continue to work closely with the (UK Civil Aviation Authority) to monitor the situation,"" he tweeted.    - Engine on fire -    The Denver incident comes on heels of a similar problem in Japan in December.  A video shot from inside the United aircraft -- which had 229 passengers and 10 crew on board -- showed the right engine ablaze and wobbling on the wing of the Boeing 777-200.  Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered extra inspections of some passenger jets after the incident.   ""I have directed them to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines,"" FAA chief Steve Dickson said in a statement.  Dickson said a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades, which were unique to the model and only used on 777 planes.   Officials from the FAA met with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives on Sunday evening, he added.  The US National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) said a preliminary investigation indicated two fan blades fractured on the number 2 engine on the plan.  ""The airplane sustained minor damage,"" the NTSB said in a statement Sunday. ""The examination and documentation of the airplane is ongoing.""  Pratt & Whitney said it was cooperating with the NTSB probe and ""will continue to work to ensure the safe operation of the fleet.""  United said Sunday it was removing the aircraft from its schedule, ""and will continue to work closely with regulators to determine any additional steps.""  Japan's transport ministry earlier said it had ordered stricter inspections of engines after a Japan Airlines 777 plane flying from Haneda to Naha experienced trouble with ""an engine in the same family"" in December.  Asiana Airlines, South Korea's second-largest carrier, also said it would not fly any of its seven currently operational 777s.     - Navigating industry downturn -    The engine failure is unwelcome news for Boeing, which only recently resumed deliveries of the 737 MAX following a 20-month global grounding after two tragic crashes killed 346 people.  The MAX began returning to commercial service in late 2020, a time when commercial airline travel remains depressed due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Boeing executives said last month they expect it will take about three years for activity to return to pre-pandemic levels.  Michel Merluzeau, an expert at consultancy AIR, agreed the latest problem did not appear to result from poor plane design by the aerospace giant.  ""It's not really a problem for Boeing,"" he said. ""It's more an issue of maintenance -- how United or Pratt & Whitney is maintaining engines that have been in use for a while.""  Shares of Boeing recovered from early losses, rising 1.2 percent to $220.07, while Pratt & Whitney parent company Raytheon Technologies fell 0.5 percent to $73.81.  United jumped 5.8 percent to $50.83, joining other carriers in rallying after a positive note from Deutsche Bank about the industry's prospects amid improving Covid-19 trends.  jul-jmb/hs     BOEING    GOL LINHAS AERAS INTELIGENTES    UNITED TECHNOLOGIES    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Around 850,000 people attended the last event in 2019, and this year organisers expected between 750,000 and one million.  Under a clear blue sky, fans gathered for the start of the free parade for around two kilometres (1.4 miles) along the river in the heart of Switzerland's financial capital.  As the temperature reached 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit), the river's banks were full of revellers, many taking the plunge into the water to keep cool.  The highlight of the event is 30 floats known as ""lovemobiles"", which are usually brightly decorated trucks with music, DJs and party-goers.  More than 200 DJs will play at this year's event including international stars Adriatique, Anna Tur, Ida Engberg, Reinier Zonneveld and Syreeta.  After two years marked by the pandemic, the organisers said the parade's motto was ""THINK"".  ""Thoughts are the key to a peaceful coexistence of our cultures, no matter what religion, skin colour, origin or sexual orientation people belong to,"" organisers said.

""This land is Russian, always has been, and always will be!""  It was on this spot near Lake Peipus on Russia's border with Estonia that eight centuries ago Nevsky repelled a force of Teutonic Knights who wanted to convert Russia to Catholicism.  Known as the Battle of the Ice because it was fought largely on the frozen lake, the clash in April 1242 is celebrated as a great victory against efforts to turn Russia away from Eastern Orthodox Christianity.  For the hundreds of history enthusiasts re-enacting the battle on a recent August day, that victory is especially resonant today, as Russian forces wage an offensive in Ukraine framed by the Kremlin as part of an enduring conflict with the West.  ""We are fighting against Europe just like our ancestors did,"" says Oleg Yakontov, a 56-year-old retired paratrooper, holding a sword and shield as sweat drips off his face.  Historical re-enactments are a popular pastime in Russia, whether of mediaeval battles, Napoleonic-era clashes or the fierce fighting of World War II.    - Historic parallels -    Drawing parallels with that history -- and with President Vladimir Putin as a kind of successor to figures like Nevsky -- is part of the messaging put forward by the Kremlin and Russian state media in support of Moscow's campaign in Ukraine.  ""To me, Nevsky symbolises the defence of the Motherland and victory,"" says 23-year-old Vladislav Vasilyev, still out of breath after taking part in the re-enactment.  Several hundred people gathered for the mock battle near the lake, called Lake Chud in Russian. They feasted on grilled meat and listened to live rock music as the combatants pummelled each other on the field.  The event culminated in horseback combat demonstrations a few metres away from a large metal sculpture of Nevsky that was inaugurated in September 2021 by Putin and Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church.  ""Alexander Nevsky's personality was truly grandiose,"" Putin said at the time, praising him as a ""talented commander"" and ""skilful diplomat"".  Part of the modern-day appeal of Nevsky for the Kremlin was his alliance with the great power of the time, the Mongol Empire and its Golden Horde, which had destroyed and seized many of Russia's lands.   For some in Russia, Nevsky's acceptance of Mongol dominion helped preserve the country's religious traditions and Eurasian character in the face of Western expansionism.  ""His main achievement is this civilisational choice,"" says Igor Fomyn, a bearded 52-year-old Orthodox priest in a black cassock who came to watch the spectacle.  ""By making this choice, he put spirituality, his people, and his Motherland before comfort,"" the priest says.    - Hero of landmark film -     Nevsky has been used in the past to stir up patriotic fervour, most famously in Sergei Eisenstein's landmark propaganda film ""Alexander Nevsky"" in 1938.  Made at a time of strained ties between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, the film portrayed Nevsky as a heroic figure battling Teutonic domination.   It features an epic recreation of the battle at Lake Peipus with the heavily armoured crusaders crashing through the ice and drowning -- a scene many historians regard as of dubious authenticity.  The film was pulled from cinemas when the USSR and Germany signed a non-aggression pact in 1939, then allowed back onto screens when the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.  Nevsky remains a cherished historical figure for many in Russia, and some here have little doubt about who would be his modern counterpart.  ""Our president is continuing his work, of course,"" says Oleg Davydov, a 52-year-old engineer, in attendance at the re-enactment.  ""It's all about this country's defence, its strength, its security.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The statements came on a shocking day for the United States, which saw mobs overrun Congress after a rally by Trump, who had sought to thwart the process of lawmakers certifying election results.  That was the final administrative step before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden enters the White House later this month, but the normally ceremonial affair spiraled into mayhem.  ""The chaos unfolding in the nation's capital is the result of unlawful efforts to overturn the legitimate results of a democratic election. The country deserves better,"" the Business Roundtable said in a statement.   The lobbying group, which represents over 200 chief executives, ""called on the President and all relevant officials to put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power.""  US Chamber of Commerce CEO Thomas J. Donohue said, ""The attacks against our nation's Capitol Building and our democracy must end now.   ""The Congress of the United States must gather again this evening to conclude their Constitutional responsibility to accept the report of the Electoral College,"" which determines the winner of the presidential vote.  Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers went further, calling on Vice President Mike Pence to ""seriously consider"" invoking the US constitution's 25th amendment, which would allow him to temporarily become president after Trump is deemed incapacitated.  The group has been viewed as supportive of Trump's agenda of protecting American manufacturers, but Timmons said, ""The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy.""    - 'Coup' attempt -    Without referring to the assault on the Capitol, Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Twitter, ""Violence is always unacceptable. We must respect our constitution and democratic process.""  The attack saw flag-waving Trump supporters break down barricades outside the iconic white-domed building and swarm its halls, sending sessions of the House and Senate into an emergency recess.  That interrupted the effort by some lawmakers from Trump's Republican party to mount a quixotic attempt to delay certification of Biden's win.  In extraordinary images, armed security personnel were seen barricading the chamber with weapons drawn, while lawmakers huddled inside wearing gas masks.  Labor leader Richard Trumka, president of the powerful AFL-CIO, called the unrest ""one of the greatest assaults on our democracy since the Civil War"" from 1861 to 1865.  ""Today's attempted coup has been years in the making as Donald Trump consistently spews venom, conspiracies, hate and lies to his supporters,"" he said in a statement.  While avoiding Trump's name, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said ""our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transfer of power.""   Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat, said he was ""disgusted"" by the attack, but added, ""While these scenes are very difficult to watch, I have faith in our Democratic process, and know that the important work of Congress will continue and that people will be held accountable for their actions.""  Arvind Krishan, chairman and CEO of technology giant IBM, said the company ""condemns today's unprecedented lawlessness and we call for it to end immediately.

Three bodies have been found and a desperate operation has been launched to rescue about 20 people trapped in a tunnel, the Uttarakhand state police chief said.  The massive surge of water swept through the Dhauliganga river valley, destroying everything in its path, videos taken by terrified residents showed.  ""There was a cloud of dust as the water went by. The ground shook like an earthquake,"" local inhabitant Om Agarwal told Indian TV.   Most of the missing were workers at two power plants that were battered by the deluge, caused by a huge chunk of glacier that slipped off a mountainside further upstream, said the police chief Ashok Kumar.  ""There were 50 workers at Rishi Ganga plant and we have no information about them. Some 150 workers were at Tapovan,"" he added.  ""About 20 are trapped inside a tunnel. We are trying to reach the trapped workers.""  With the main road washed away, the tunnel was filled with mud and rocks, and paramilitary rescuers had to climb down a hillside on ropes to reach the entrance.  Hundreds of troops and paramilitaries along with military helicopters and other aircraft have been sent to the region.    - 'Grim reminder' -    Authorities emptied two dams to stop the flood waters reaching the Ganges at the towns of Rishikesh and Haridwar, where authorities barred people from going near the banks of the sacred river, officials said.  Villages on hillsides overlooking the river were evacuated, but as night fell authorities said the main flood danger had passed.  Scores of social media users captured the disaster, with footage showing water tearing through a narrow valley below the power plant, leaving roads and bridges destroyed in its wake.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was monitoring the relief operation.  ""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone's safety there,"" he said on Twitter.  About 14 glaciers overlook the river in Nanda Devi national park -- the topic of scientific studies because of growing fears over climate change and deforestation.  ""Avalanches are common phenomena in the catchment area,"" M.P.S. Bisht, director of the Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, told AFP. ""Huge landslides also frequently occur.""  He said the glacier could have blocked the river, causing the buildup that had devastating force when it broke through.   The increased pace of development in the poor Himalayan regions has also heightened fears about fallout from deforestation and other environmental troubles.  Monsoon floods in Uttarakhand in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of development projects in the state, particularly in isolated areas like those around the Rishi Ganga dam.  Uma Bharti, a former water resources minister, said that she had called for a freeze on hydroelectric projects in ""sensitive"" Himalayan areas including the Ganges and its tributaries when in government.  Vimlendhu Jha, founder of Swechha, an environmental NGO, said the disaster was a ""grim reminder"" of the effects of climate change and the ""haphazard development of roads, railways and power plants in ecologically sensitive areas.""

Preliminary results broadcast by local media indicate that Deputy President William Ruto and Raila Odinga, the veteran opposition leader now backed by the ruling party, are neck-and-neck, raising the likelihood of a challenge by the losing candidate.  No presidential poll outcome has gone uncontested in Kenya since 2002, and the disputes have led to bloodshed in the past, either involving ethnic clashes or police violence.  The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is under pressure to deliver a free and fair poll after 2017 presidential vote was annulled due to irregularities in the counting process and mismanagement by the election body.   But with the complex process of verifying and tallying votes expected to take days, social media is swamped with disinformation about the results, with rights campaigners and civil society groups accusing both candidates' camps of sharing misleading posts.  Observers from the Commonwealth warned on Thursday that the delay in releasing the results was allowing disinformation to spread rapidly online.  ""The time lag between the announcement of the official results by the IEBC and the provisional, and at times conflicting, results announced by the media is an area of concern,"" Bruce Golding, chairman of the Commonwealth Observer Group, told a press conference in Nairobi.  - 'Need trust in the system' -    At a separate briefing, observers from the United States also voiced concern about misinformation spreading as the counting process entered its third day.  ""It is important that there is timely and accurate information and that all the citizens have access to that information,"" said Donna Brazile of the National Democratic Institute.  ""It is about the citizens having trust in the system and that is working properly. It is not about the continuation of campaigns -- campaigns have ended, and results must be tabulated accurately to ensure confidence in the system.""  The remarks echoed concerns shared by Amnesty International and several Kenyan civil society groups on Wednesday about ""rising levels of false or misleading information"" being shared on social media.  They said in a statement that several posts by candidates and their supporters in the rival camps had ""intentionally sought to misinform the electorate and the public"" on the electoral process and election results.  ""These include distortion, false information shared without malicious intent (misinformation) and those shared to deliberately deceive people (disinformation).""  Kenyans voted in six elections on Tuesday, choosing a new president as well as senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials in polls that were largely peaceful.  The IEBC has yet to publish a final turnout figure but as of Wednesday, turnout was just over 65 percent.  That compares with a final turnout of 78 percent in the disputed August 2017 election.  Observers from the East African Community (EAC) said the lower turnout, especially among Kenyans aged under 35, was worrying.  ""This should concern everyone that young people are not participating in the process,"" said Jakaya Kikwete, head of the bloc's observation mission.  As economic pressures have mounted in the country of 50 million, with food and fuel costs shooting up, many Kenyans said they were fed up with electing leaders who had done little to ease their troubles.  ""I have voted twice in my life and after the last election I decided I won't even vote because it is a waste of time,"" Ruth Musyoki, 40, told AFP in Nairobi.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

Thousands of protesters defied government warnings to rally from Vladivostok to Saint Petersburg in a second weekend of mass demonstrations over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent.  Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning he blames on the Kremlin.  The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a Moscow detention centre and faces years of potential jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.  In moves not seen for years in Moscow, authorities locked down the centre of the capital Sunday, with hundreds of police lining the streets, central Metro stations closed and restrictions on the movements of pedestrians.  Protesters who had hoped to gather outside the headquarters of the FSB security service were instead scattered to various parts of the city as organisers made last-minute changes in locations.  AFP journalists saw dozens of protesters detained and taken into police vans.     - US, EU condemns 'harsh tactics' -    Several thousand were seen marching throughout the city centre, but it was unclear amid the chaos how many people took part in the demonstration.  Independent monitor OVD-Info said at least 4,818 people had been detained across the country, after reporting more than 4,000 detentions during similar protests on January 23.  It said at least 1,365 were detained in Moscow and 962 in Saint Petersburg, as well as 82 journalists across the country.   US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Twitter condemned ""the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists by Russian authorities for a second week straight"".  The Russian foreign ministry hit back, accusing the United States of ""gross interference"" in its affairs and of using ""online platforms controlled by Washington"" to promote the protests.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also said he deplored the ""widespread detentions and disproportionate use of force"" against protesters and journalists.  ""Russia needs to comply with its international commitments,"" he added in a tweet.  Protesters chanted ""Freedom!"" and ""Putin is a thief!"" as they marched through Moscow, braving bitter cold and snow.   Several hundred protesters eventually gathered outside the Matrosskaya Tishina prison where Navalny is being held. Dozens were detained outside the complex.  ""It's almost embarrassing that the state is so afraid of us,"" 31-year-old protester Elisaveta Dementieva told AFP at the Moscow demonstration.    - Golden toilet brushes -    Many protesters carried gold-painted toilet brushes in reference to a video released by Navalny's team alleging that Putin had been gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast, which among other luxurious goods featured toilet brushes costing 700 euros ($840) apiece.  As night fell in Moscow protesters began to head home, with some wondering whether the demonstration would have any impact.   ""It's true we are asking ourselves if these protests will really do any good,"" said Nadia, a 21-year-old student. ""It will take more for Navalny to be freed. And even more for Russia to be free.""  Several thousand people demonstrated in the second city of Saint Petersburg, despite police closing off the main thoroughfare Nevsky Prospekt and shutting Metro stations, an AFP journalist reported.   Police were seen roughly detaining several protesters, including one young man who was left with a bloodied head.  Earlier, protesters had rallied in cities including the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where dozens escaped the police on the frozen waters of the Amur Bay and danced in a circle.  Several thousand were also reported to have protested in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk despite temperatures dropping to -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).    - Navalny's wife detained -    Russian authorities issued several warnings against participating in the unauthorised rallies and threatened criminal charges against protesters.  The head of Russia's Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, called Sunday's events a ""provocation"" and said they have ""nothing to do with protecting rights"", news agency TASS reported.  Navalny is due in court several times next week, including on Tuesday on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.   His team has called for supporters to gather outside the courtroom.  Navalny's wife Yulia posted a picture of her family on Instagram on Sunday, urging supporters to make their voices heard.  ""If we remain silent, then tomorrow they will come for any one of us,"" she wrote.  Navalny's team said Yulia was detained by police shortly after she announced her arrival at Sunday's rally on social media.  tbm-mm/har/jj",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

Emergency workers have been trying to clear the debris of a gun and bomb attack by the Al-Qaeda-linked group on the popular Hayat hotel which left parts of the building in ruins, with many feared trapped inside.  ""The ministry of health has so far confirmed the deaths of 21 people and 117 people wounded"" in the assault that began on Friday evening and lasted over a day, Adan said.   On Sunday morning, the area surrounding the hotel was under tight security, with the roads blocked as emergency workers and bomb disposal experts sought to clear any explosives and remove rubble.  The hotel sustained heavy damage during the gunfight between Somali forces and the insurgents.  Parts of the building collapsed, leaving many people frantically searching for their loved ones who were inside when the attack began.  Police commissioner Abdi Hassan Mohamed Hijar told reporters on Sunday that ""106 people including children and women"" were rescued during the siege which ended around midnight.  As bullets and flames ripped through the hotel, security forces searched the property to bring civilians to safety, including three young children who hid inside a toilet.  ""The casualties mostly happened in the early hours of the attack, after that security forces spent time rescuing people individually and room by room,"" Hijar said.  The attack was the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June, and underscored the challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist group.    - 'Tense' -    Dozens of people gathered near the road leading up to the hotel on Sunday morning, desperate for news of their family members.  Businessman Muktar Adan told AFP he was waiting for permission to enter the premises and look for his sibling.  ""My brother was inside the hotel the last time we heard from him, but his phone is switched off now and we don't know what to expect,"" he said.  Said Nurow, who heard the attack unfold, said he was very worried about his friend who was a guest at the property.  ""I hope... (he) is alive, he stayed in the hotel according to the last information we got from his sister,"" he told AFP, describing the mood as ""tense"".  The hotel was a favoured meeting spot for government officials and scores of people were inside when gunmen stormed the property.   Somalia's allies, including the United States, Britain and Turkey, as well as the UN, have strongly condemned the attack. So did ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  Earlier this month, Washington announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - 'Audacious attack' -    Samira Gaid, executive director of the Hiraal Institute, a Mogadishu-based security think tank, told AFP that the ""audacious attack"" was a message to the new government and its foreign allies.  ""The complex attack is to show that they are still very much present, very relevant and that they can penetrate government security and conduct such attacks,"" she said.  Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  According to Gaid, the president later told officials that the government's ""first objective is to fight the group militarily and weaken then before they can go into any negotiations.""  ""This attack will trigger a faster strategy and response especially when it comes to engaging the group,"" she said.  According to police, the attack began with a blast caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel along with gunmen.  Minutes later, a second explosion struck as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to help the injured, witnesses said.  Al-Shabaab, which claimed responsibility for the hotel siege, has carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office, and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopian border.  The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, but still control swathes of countryside and retain the ability to launch deadly strikes, often targeting hotels and restaurants.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  nur-ho-amu/ach",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Under the government decree, air conditioning must be turned down and set at no lower than 27 degrees Celsius (80.6 degrees Fahrenheit) during the warmest months of the year, in rules affecting everything from public transport to shops, offices, theatres and cinemas.  During the summer months, temperatures across Spain often hit 40C or higher.   The legislation also affects heating in winter, when temperatures can be set no higher than 19C.  ""The plan's aim is to save gas for the winter in case (Russian President Vladimir) Putin decides to cut off gas supplies to Europe as a result of sanctions,"" said Joan Groizard, head of the Energy Savings and Diversification Institute at Spain's ecology ministry.  That scenario ""could make this winter very difficult"", he told public television.  Adopted last week, the legislation also requires that from 10:00 pm (2000 GMT), shops switch off window-display lighting in a move also affecting the illumination of public buildings.   By the end of September, any air-conditioned or heated premises must have an automatic door-closing mechanism installed to avoid energy waste.  However, the law does not lay out any specific penalties and has left the task of monitoring compliance to Spain's 17 regions, some of which have been highly critical of the move, notably those run by the right-wing opposition People's Party.   Among the most critical has been Madrid's regional leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso, who has vowed to take the measure to Spain's Constitutional Court.     - Preparing for winter -    The government unveiled details of the plan in May as part of an EU-wide effort to cut dependence on Russia for oil and gas following its February invasion of Ukraine.   The European Commission is planning to cut EU dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies of the fuel before 2030.  An EU-wide plan to cut gas consumption came into effect on Tuesday with the aim of member states cutting back by ""at least 15 percent"" between August and March 2023 based on their average use over the past five years.  Given the unique position of Spain and Portugal and their limited connection with the European energy market, Brussels has allowed both countries to adopt a reduced target of seven percent.   The overriding aim is to bolster gas reserves in time for what is likely to be a very tough winter, with European households and businesses already squeezed by skyrocketing energy prices.  Groizard said the new rules ""would not (on their own) enable Spain to reach its 7.0 percent target"", saying further energy-saving measures would be unveiled in due course.   Spain's energy supplies were assured, he recalled, saying the country had ""very low dependence on Russian gas"" compared with other European nations.   The United States is currently Spain's biggest gas supplier, providing a 29.6 percent of its supplies in June.   Deliveries from Algeria, which had long been Spain's top supplier, dropped to 21.6 percent in the same month following a diplomatic spat with Madrid, with Russia moving into second place with 24.4 percent, figures from gas network operator Enagas show.  tpe/hmw/ds/imm   ENAGAS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

Leftist economist Arauz leads the field with 32.3 percent of the vote following Sunday's general election with over 97.5 percent of results declared, but indigenous rights activist Perez and right-wing ex-banker Guillermo Lasso are locked in a fierce battle to finish second.  Arauz told AFP he hoped victory in the April 11 runoff would ""build a project of national unity, in which we can have a greater level of self-criticism and invite the different segments of our society to unite on an emergency economic and health plan.""  The vote took place amid a backdrop of economic problems exacerbated by a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed 15,000 lives in Ecuador.  Sunday's polls were marred by long lines of people waiting to cast ballots as virus restrictions caused chaos.  The battle for second place has been full of twists, the latest of which has been Perez's accusations.  ""A fraud is being connived... to prevent us from reaching the second round,"" Perez told the press.  Initial exit polls suggested Lasso would face Arauz in the runoff, only to be upended when an official projection by the country's National Electoral Council based on partial results pointed to Perez.  The gap between the two candidates has narrowed again, though, with Perez on 19.8 percent and Lasso on 19.6 percent.  But the Electoral Council has said it is revising almost 14 percent of votes due to inconsistencies.  ""There's panic that we'll get to the second round,"" said Perez, alleging that he'd lost 15 percentage points to other candidates after some of his votes were registered to others.  In Washington, the State Department urged voters to ""remain calm and to exercise patience while Ecuador's institutions finish tallying the votes and work to resolve conflicts in a peaceful and transparent manner.""    - End to corruption? -    The country's 13.1 million voters are choosing a successor to unpopular socialist President Lenin Moreno and the 137 members of congress.  Strict health precautions appeared to slow voting and may have discouraged some from casting their ballots, as long lines stretched outside polling stations.  The field had been crowded, with 16 candidates, including Ximena Pena, the only woman.   Arauz, 36, represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while lawyer Perez, 51, is from the leftist Pachakutik party, and is the first indigenous candidate to get this far in the presidential race.  Arauz is a protege of Rafael Correa, a two-time president who currently lives in Belgium to evade a conviction for corruption but remains a strong force in the country.  ""People have voted not in direct support to Arauz but because he is the Correa candidate,"" political scientist Karen Garzon Sherdek, from the International University SEK, told AFP.  ""Thank you dear Ecuador!"" Correa tweeted as the results came in. ""The Citizen Revolution has won overwhelmingly, despite a dirty campaign and 4 years of brutal persecution and infamy.""  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year, austerity-driven hiatus under Moreno.  However, he vowed to take a different approach to relations with the US from that of Correa, who aligned himself with socialist regimes in Venezuela and Bolivia.  ""Our relations with the United States will be excellent, especially now with the administration of President (Joe) Biden,"" said Arauz.  He has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.    - Under pressure -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno amid crashing crude prices.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, did not seek reelection. His four-year term will end on May 24.  sp-pld/vel/bc-mdl/ft","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76763779', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84078919']"

The FSB security services pointed the finger at Ukraine for Saturday's shock car bombing in Moscow's outskirts that killed Daria Dugina, the 29-year-old daughter of Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin, an outspoken advocate for the invasion of Ukraine.  ""The crime was prepared and committed by Ukrainian special services,"" the FSB said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies, adding that a bomb had been attached to the car driven by Dugina.  The brazen killing -- and Moscow's rapid accusation -- marks a potentially destabilizing turn in the six-month-old conflict.  Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the killing of the journalist and political commentator as a ""vile crime"" in a message of condolence to her family.  The FSB said the person responsible was a Ukrainian woman born in 1979 who had rented an apartment in the same building where Dugina lived.  After the car bombing, she had fled to EU member Estonia, it added.  Dugin, 60, is an outspoken Russian ultranationalist intellectual who enthusiastically backs Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as did his daughter. Russian media reports suggest Dugina had borrowed her father's car at the last minute.  Over the weekend, Kyiv denied any link to the bombing.    - Ukrainian casualties -    Authorities on Monday meanwhile revealed the extent of the casualties among Ukrainian troops.  General Valeriy Zaluzhny, Ukraine's commander-in-chief, said the country's children needed particular attention ""because their fathers have gone to the front and are maybe among the nearly 9,000 heroes who have been killed"".  Zaluzhny's comments on the Ukrainian death toll, reported by Interfax-Ukraine news agency, were the first indication of Kyiv's military losses since April.  On Wednesday, Ukraine will mark its independence day -- and six months since Russian troops invaded.  After Ukrainian resistance thwarted an early Russian push on Kyiv, Moscow's forces have focused on gaining ground in the country's east.  The European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters in Spain that the bloc was considering military training for Ukrainian troops.  The shockwaves of the war are being felt around the world with soaring energy prices and food shortages.    - Buying time? -    A Ukraine presidential adviser said Russia is trying to coax Ukraine into fresh talks in order to buy time to regroup for a fresh offensive.  For weeks, the Kremlin has been ""trying to convince Ukraine to enter into negotiations"", Mykhaylo Podolyak told AFP.  He suggested this was a ploy to ""freeze the conflict while preserving the status quo in the occupied Ukrainian territories.""  Podolyak said Kyiv believes Moscow does not really want serious peace talks but ""an operation pause for its army"" ahead of a new offensive.    - Tense Independence Day -    In Spain, Borrell told reporters that EU defence ministers would next week discuss launching a major training operation for Ukrainian forces in nearby countries.  ""It seems reasonable that a war that is lasting and looks set to last requires an effort not only in terms of supplies of material,"" Borrell said.  All EU member states would have to agree to step up the training that several are already providing Ukraine under bilateral agreements.  EU defence ministers have a two-day meeting in Prague from next Monday.  With much of Europe preparing for fuel shortages as Moscow cuts back its deliveries to the West in response to sanctions, Bulgaria said it was seeking talks with Russia gas giant Gazprom.  The country is almost totally dependent on Russia for natural gas supplies.  ""We obviously have to turn to them,"" said Energy Minister Rosen Hristov.  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned over the weekend that Russia might mark Ukraine's Independence Day by launching a trial of Ukrainian soldiers captured during the siege of Mariupol.  ""This will be the line beyond which no negotiations are possible,"" he warned Sunday.  Soldiers from Ukraine's Azov regiment captured by Russian forces after the battle for Mariupol said Monday they had been beaten in captivity.  The soldiers, released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers who were beaten until their bones were broken.  One ex-prisoner said he had observed cases of ""serious torture"".  bur/cdw/jh/mlm   GAZPROM",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113565637']

Just weeks ago, Democrats were in the doldrums.  With Biden's approval ratings below 40 percent and the party seemingly unable to close the deal on a series of election promises, there were widespread expectations that the Republicans would easily take control of at least one chamber of Congress in the November 8 midterms.  A dramatic August, however, has sown the seeds of what some Democrats hope will be a political miracle, with their party holding the Senate and at minimum mitigating the size of the Republican win in the House of Representatives.  At the rally in Maryland, just outside Washington, Biden will lay out the party's message as it seeks to build on momentum kickstarted by a spate of legislative wins in Congress, as well as anger for many Americans over the conservative-dominated Supreme Court's recent ruling to end nationwide abortion access rights.  ""The president will lay out the choice before Americans. He'll highlight how he and congressional Democrats have delivered results for working families,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.  She cited the racking up of laws on funding high tech investment, the green economy, healthcare and also a limited, but still politically impressive approval for new gun safety restrictions.  The Republican agenda, she said, is beholden to Donald Trump, currently embroiled in a dispute with the Justice Department and the FBI over his allegedly illegal removal of top secret documents from the White House to his Florida golf club residence.  Their ""extreme"" agenda means ""taking away our rights and defending the super rich,"" she said.  The speech will come the day after Biden's latest move -- his announcement Wednesday that millions of voters will be eligible to have between $10,000 and $20,000 canceled from their often crippling student debt.    - Shifting polls -    The mood shift comes in a period where experts say the unpredictable post-pandemic economy and the deep passions sparked in the Supreme Court abortion ruling could upend traditional patterns for midterm elections.  One reason the Republicans were expecting wins is that opposition parties nearly always punish the president's party in midterms.  Another is that Biden, after a tough year marred by repeated new Covid variants and the highest inflation in 40 years, is so unpopular. His average approval rating has been stuck below 40 percent since late June, making him as unpopular as Trump before him.  Add in redistricting of House seats that was widely believed to favor the Republicans -- effectively almost guaranteeing them several extra seats -- and Republican party leaders were predicting a ""red wave"" to sweep ""blue"" Democrats away.  Now there's giddy talk on the left of a blue riptide washing back in the other direction.  The average of baseline polls asking which party should control Congress has shifted from months where Republicans led to a narrow 44-43.6 percent advantage for Democrats.  In the individual races, there are also glimmers of hope for Biden's party. A Democrat won Wednesday in a special election in a House swing district in New York -- exactly the kind of district Republicans would expect to flip in a red wave.  The Senate, which Democrats currently only control with one vote, was also thought to be trending Republican, but even Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell says that's now a 50-50 proposition.  ""I think there's probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate,"" McConnell  said.  The veteran insider cited the ""quality"" of his party's Senate candidates. It was a clear dig at some of the Republican contenders chosen in large part because of their populist, pro-Trump credentials, rather than credibility with the electorate at large.  Meanwhile, Biden's own polling, while still terrible, is also creeping up.  A Gallup poll on Thursday showed 44 percent approval, his best result in a year. By comparison, this is actually better polling for an August before midterm elections than Trump in 2018 or Barack Obama in 2014, Gallup said.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112811646']

The plant -- Europe's largest facility -- was cut off from Ukraine's power network for the first time in its history on Thursday due to ""actions of the invaders"", Energoatom said.  Zaporizhzhia has been cause for mounting concern since it was seized by Russian troops in the opening weeks of the war.  In recent weeks, Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame for rocket strikes around the facility in the southern Ukrainian city of Energodar.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Thursday the cut-off was caused by Russian shelling of the last active power line linking the plant to the network.   ""Russia has put Ukrainians as well as all Europeans one step away from radiation disaster,"" he said in his nightly address.  Early Friday, Energoatom said on Telegram that all reactors remain ""disconnected from the electrical grid"" as of 9 am local time (0600 GMT).  However a severed power line -- the cause of the outage -- has been ""restored"" and ""work is ongoing to prepare the connection"" of two of the plant's six reactors.    - Inspection scheduled -    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has previously said the situation at the plant is ""highly volatile"" and ""underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"".  ""We can't afford to lose any more time,"" the organisation's Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on Thursday.  ""I'm determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days.""   Ukraine energy minister adviser Lana Zerkal said the inspection ""is planned for the next week, and now we are working on how they will get there"".  But in an interview with Ukraine's Radio NV on Thursday evening she was sceptical the mission would go ahead, despite Moscow's formal agreement.  ""They are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission will not reach the site,"" she said.  Zelensky has said ""the IAEA and other international organisations should react much quicker"".  Energoatom said the plant outage was caused by a power line being twice disconnected by ash pit fires in an adjacent thermal power plant.  The three other power lines ""were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks"" by Russian forces, the operator said.  Energoatom did not disclose whether there were blackouts as a result of the power cut.  However the mayor of the city of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov said on Thursday ""Russian occupiers cut off the electricity in almost all occupied settlements of Zaporizhzhia"".    - Diversion plans -    Kyiv suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russian troops in 2014.  But on Thursday, Washington issued a direct warning against any such move.  ""The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.  ""Any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable.""  President Joe Biden, in a telephone conversation with Zelensky, also called for Russia to return full control of the plant and let in nuclear inspectors, the White House said.  Zelensky said he had spoken with Biden and thanked him for the United States' ""unwavering"" support.  Britain's defence ministry has warned that weekend satellite imagery shows an increased presence of Russian troops at the power plant.  Armoured personnel carriers were deployed within 60 metres (200 feet) of one reactor and ""Russian troops were probably attempting to conceal the vehicles by parking them under overhead pipes and gantries"".  ""Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near (the plant) for propaganda purposes,"" the ministry said.  bur-jts/brw/lcm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

""After preliminary data, an explosion happened which set off a fire,"" said the emergency situations ministry in a statement, giving a toll of three dead and around 40 people hospitalised.   They also reported that a nearby building had collapsed and published the names of 25 people loved ones were trying to contact, saying they might be trapped under its ruins.  As the search for survivors continued, rescue workers were using a digger to clear away rubble, an AFP journalist at the scene reported.  They had so far pulled 10 survivors from the rubble and recovered one body, said the ministry statement.  The wholesale market at Surmalu is normally very busy on Sunday afternoons, which when the blast happened.  The cause of the fire has not yet been established, but local news reports, citing witnesses, said the explosion happened at a place that stored fireworks. The authorities have so far made no statement on what might have caused the fire.  Photos and videos posted on social media showed a thick column of black smoke over the market and what appeared to be a series of detonations can be heard.    - Bomb scare -    A number of volunteers were also helping at the scene, scrambling to move piles of twisted concrete blocks and metal bars with their bare hands.  Nearby, firefighters kept their hoses trained on the smoking ruins, soaking them down with water.  In all, 200 firefighters and medical workers were sent to the scene, as well as fire engines and construction site equipment.  The disaster comes at a time when the country is already going through a difficult period.  Armenia, a small country with around three million inhabitants, is still recovering from the 2020 war with Azerbaijan, which ended in a heavy defeat which in turn sparked a political crisis.  Reflecting the current tensions, the Yerevan metro system was evacuated shortly after the blast following a bomb scare, officials said, adding that no device had been find.  Armenia's neighbour, Russia, said via its embassy that it was trying to establish if any of its citizens were victims of the blast.  It offered its condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in the disaster.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113514937']

Despite authorities ramping up pressure on the opposition with arrests and criminal probes, Navalny aides have called for new nationwide demonstrations ahead of the opposition leader's trial set to start on February 2.  The first protests took place in the Far East, including the port city of Vladivostok where several dozen protesters gathered in the city's central square despite police closing it off ahead of the rally.   ""The desire to live in a free country is stronger than the fear of being detained,"" 25-year-old student Andrei, who preferred not to give his last name, told AFP.  AFP footage from Vladivostok showed dozens of protesters escaping the police on the frozen waters of the Amur Bay and circle dancing.  Russian authorities have issued several warnings against participating in the unauthorised rallies and threatened criminal charges against protesters.  According to independent monitors, at least 261 people were detained in more than a dozen cities before the expected start of the rally in Moscow, which usually mobilises the largest crowds.  In an unprecedented move police in the capital announced the closure of seven metro stations and said movement of pedestrians would be limited in the city centre.  Moscow authorities also said some centrally-located restaurants and shops will close and overground transport diverted.  Police detained 44-year-old Navalny at a Moscow airport on January 17 as he arrived from Germany, where he had been recovering from exposure to a Soviet-designed nerve toxin.  A makeshift court at a police station ordered the anti-graft campaigner placed in custody until his trial on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.  The Moscow rally is due to take place outside the headquarters of the Federal Security Service, Russia's main security agency, which Navalny says carried out the near-fatal poisoning attack on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.    - 'Wake them up' -    ""The majority is on our side. Let's wake them up,"" Navalny said on Thursday in a message from Moscow's Matrosskaya Tishina, a high-security detention centre.  Tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets of over 100 cities across the country last Saturday to protest Putin's 20-year-rule.  More than 4,000 demonstrators were detained while authorities launched a series of criminal probes.  Authorities are also targeting online platforms demanding they delete posts with calls for rallies or face fines.  The country's media watchdog said Friday it summoned representatives of several social networks, including Facebook and TikTok, for failing to comply.  This week several Navalny associates, including lawyer Lyubov Sobol and his brother Oleg, have been placed under house arrest until late March pending charges for violating coronavirus restrictions by calling people to join protests.  Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh was detained late Saturday also over violating virus measures, the same day she was due to walk free after a nine-day jail term for violating protest laws.   The head of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, Ivan Zhdanov, said Saturday the Investigative Committee informed him that a criminal case on fraud charges had been launched against Navalny.   In December last year, investigators said they were initiating a probe into Navalny allegedly misappropriating over $4 million of donations to his organisations.   Days after Navalny was taken into custody, his team released a video report alleging Putin had been gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast, garnering over 100 million views on YouTube.  The Kremlin has denied that the Russian president owns the opulent complex, which according to Navalny features an underground ice hockey arena, a private casino and vineyards.  State television on Friday sought to rebut opposition claims the Black Sea property was a luxurious palace by airing footage of it under construction.  Billionaire Arkady Rotenberg -- Putin's former judo partner who is under Western sanctions -- said Saturday he was the owner of the property and that he was building a hotel there.   acl/bp   FACEBOOK    GOOGLE",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

Valeriy Zaluzhny tells a forum that Ukraine's children need particular attention ""because their fathers have gone to the front and are maybe among the nearly 9,000 heroes who have been killed"".  The last estimate dates back to April when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that up to 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 10,000 injured.    - Ukraine accused over car bombing -      Russia's FSB security service says that Ukraine was behind a car bombing in the outskirts of Moscow that killed the daughter of hard-line Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin.  Dugin -- an outspoken ultranationalist intellectual and a vocal supporter of the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine -- is thought to have been the likely target of the attack.   Daria Dugina was killed Saturday when a bomb placed in a Toyota Land Cruiser went off as she drove on a highway some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside Moscow.  Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday describes the bombing as a ""vile, cruel crime"".  Over the weekend, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak denied that Kyiv had anything to do with the bombing.    - EU to discuss training Ukrainian troops -    The European Union will debate the launch of a major training operation for Ukrainian forces in nearby nations, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says.  The proposal will be discussed next week at a two-day meeting of EU defence ministers which gets underway in Prague on Monday, Borrell tells a press conference in Santander, in northern Spain.  Any such operation would be a step up from the military training that several nations are already providing to Ukrainian forces under bilateral agreements.    - Bulgaria turns to Gazprom -    Bulgaria announces that it will seek talks with Russian energy giant Gazprom to resume deliveries of natural gas ahead of the winter season.  Gazprom cut deliveries to Bulgaria in late April after the EU member's previous centrist government refused to pay in rubles.  Bulgaria is almost totally dependent on Russia for its annual consumption of 3.0 billion cubic metres of natural gas, and has been scrambling to secure alternative deliveries since the cut.  burs-jmy/gw   APRIL    TOYOTA MOTOR    GAZPROM",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113565637']

""What is undeniable is that it is we who won this election,"" Khalifa Sall, one of the opposition leaders, said at a press conference.  ""We won and we will not accept that our victory is stolen from us,"" he said.  Macky Sall's ruling coalition, however, maintained that it had won while acknowledging the opposition had made some gains in Sunday's elections.  ""We reject any possibility of cohabitation and ... reassure our activists that we remain in the majority at the end of this election, despite an advance by the opposition,"" former prime minister Aminata Toure, who led the presidential coalition's list in the elections, said late Monday.  The opposition hoped the elections would impose a cohabitation, or divided government, on Sall and curb any ambitions he may have for a third term.  The polls, the last before presidential elections in 2024, were an important test for Sall after local elections in January saw the opposition win in major cities, including the capital Dakar, Ziguinchor in the south and Thies in the west.  Toure on Sunday night claimed to have won 30 of the 46 departments in the country and overseas constituencies.  ""This undoubtedly gives us a majority in the National Assembly,"" she said, while acknowledging her coalition had been defeated in Dakar.    - Opposition collaboration -    The main opposition coalition, however, expressed ""astonishment"" at Toure's remarks, claiming it had won a ""comfortable majority"" and that the presidential camp was ""looking to once again confiscate the vote"".  ""We call on national and international opinion to act as witnesses against any attempt to manipulate the results,"" the opposition said in a statement Monday.  Ahead of the election, Yewwi Askan Wi (""Liberate the People"" in Wolof, one of Senegal's national languages), the main opposition coalition headed by Ousmane Sonko, who came third in the 2019 presidential election, joined forces with Wallu Senegal (""Save Senegal""), led by former president Abdoulaye Wade.  The two groups agreed to work together to obtain a parliamentary majority and ""force governmental cohabitation"".  ""The provisional results of the legislative elections show that the President of the Republic Macky Sall lost the elections ... and that he will not have a majority in the National Assembly,"" Wallu Senegal declared Monday.  The coalition also said prominent politicians including former prime minister Toure had been beaten.    - Close race -    Provisional overall results are due no later than Friday, but initial indications sugget the poll was close and that the main opposition coalition had gained ground, particularly in urban areas, according to local media.  The single round of voting will decide the 165 seats of the single-chamber parliament -- currently controlled by the president's supporters -- for the next five years.  Sall has promised to appoint a prime minister -- a position he abolished and then restored in December 2021 -- from the winning camp.  Some seven million Senegalese were eligible to vote in the election, which passed without any major incidents.  Turnout at several polling stations appeared relatively low, according to AFP correspondents and observers, and the interior ministry said the participation rate was 47 percent.  Yahya Sall, a retired soldier, said he hoped the new parliament ""will have a strong opposition presence... to advance democracy"".  Lawmakers are elected according to a system that combines proportional representation, with national lists for 53 lawmakers and majority voting in the country's departments for 97 others.  The diaspora elects the remaining 15 members of parliament.  The vote took place against a backdrop of rising prices, partly because of the Ukraine war.  The opposition has questioned the priorities of the government, which has highlighted its subsidies for oil products and food as well as infrastructure building.   Sall, 60, was elected in 2012 for seven years then re-elected in 2019 for another five. He has been accused of wanting to break the two-term limit and run again in 2024.  He has remained vague on the subject, but any defeat of his supporters in Sunday's vote could upset such plans.  The 21-day election campaign passed in a mostly calm atmosphere.  The pre-campaign period, however, was marked by violent demonstrations that left at least three people dead after several members of the main opposition coalition, including Sonko, were banned from taking part.  On June 29, the opposition eased tensions by agreeing to take part in the elections, which it had threatened to boycott.  mrb-amt/cl/imm/mtp/cwl",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84036241']

""We need this place to fight on the cultural front too,"" says artistic director Artiom Svytsoun.  The tiny underground stage and the minimalist set provides ""a form of 'art therapy'"" for the people who have stayed in Mykolaiv and need something other than the grinding fear of war.  Welcoming audience members, giving tours of the subterranean theatre and taking care of the myriad technical details, 41-year-old Svytsoun is the beating heart of the operation. He is the one who worked to get the theatre reopened in the relative safety of an underground bunker.  With the help of a European aid fund, his team took two months to transform a shelter four metres below ground into the 35-seat venue, its irregular white walls covered with a fresco reminiscent of classical theatres.  The strategic port city of Mykolaiv had a population of half a million souls before Russia invaded on February 24.  Now it bears the scars of the many bombardments it has endured almost daily for the past six months.  Three hundred metres (yards) from the elegant neo-classical building that houses the theatre stands the twisted concrete shell of the regional administration, which was hit by a missile on March 29 that killed 37 people.    - Name change -    According to the local town hall, the city has enjoyed just 25 attack-free days since February 24.   President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that, along with Kharkiv in the north and the eastern Donbas region, Mykolaiv is the most heavily bombed city in Ukraine, despite the fact that the front line is about 20 kilometres away.  The destruction has not been limited to military targets. Three universities were recently bombed and, according to regional authorities, 123 cultural institutions have been destroyed in the region since the fighting began.  Another effect of the invasion on the Mykolaiv theatre has been a name change.  The former Mykolaiv Russian Drama Theatre is now the Mykolaiv Theatre of Dramatic Arts.  In the tiny dressing room, its walls covered with photos of Soviet, Ukrainian and Hollywood actors, Kateryna Chernolishenko, 43, receives the final touches to her stage make-up and is in a good mood.  ""I'm very happy to be back on our stage, back home, and I think it's important that art can be a support for people,"" says the actress, who like her fellow thespians volunteered to take part in this premiere.  Her colleague Marina Vassyleva, who is about to don a wedding dress, adds emphatically: ""Actors, in these circumstances, are the doctors of the human soul.""  ""I see my mission and the meaning of my life right now. I am needed here in Mykolaiv,"" she says.     - 'Makes our lives easier' -    Since the start of the war, three of the theatre's  actors have joined the army and another 20 percent of the troupe have taken refuge elsewhere in Ukraine, or abroad - a modest proportion in a town that has lost more than half its population, according to the town hall.  The company is used to playing in a 450-seater theatre.  Now the plays are being adapted and squeezed into the ""stage in the shelter"", as it is called.   But despite the war, it is not just about performing patriotic works. After a curtain-raiser paying tribute to Ukraine, the first play of the new season, by a contemporary national author, is an absurdist play about ""the realisation of our desires"", says Svytsoun.  The bunker theatre will put on two shows a day, from Thursday to Sunday, much to the delight of theatregoer Olga Kroutchok.  ""I hope to come back every weekend. Theatre brings emotions to people in these times of war, and it makes our lives easier,"" said  the 55-year-old.  Fellow audience member Oleksander Skotnikov, 42, agrees. ""When we are under the bombs, as we are now, the theatre gives us a big smile and inspires people to keep on living"".",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

That points to the use again by the United States of the macabre Hellfire R9X, a warhead-less missile believed equipped with six razor-like blades extending from the fuselage that slices through its target but does not explode.  Never publicly acknowledged by the Pentagon or CIA -- the two US agencies known to undertake targeted assassinations of extremist leaders -- the R9X first appeared in March 2017 when Al-Qaeda senior leader Abu al-Khayr al-Masri was killed by a drone strike while traveling in a car in Syria.  Photos of the vehicle showed a large hole through the roof, with the car's metal, and all of the interior, including its occupants, physically shredded. But the front and rear of the car appeared completely intact.  Up until then, Hellfire missiles -- fired by drones in targeted attacks -- were known for powerful explosions and often extensive collateral damage and deaths.  Since 2017, a handful of other finely-targeted attacks show similar results.  Details of the mysterious weapon leaked out, and it was dubbed the ""flying ginsu,"" after a famous 1980s television commercial for ostensibly Japanese kitchen knives that would cut cleanly through aluminum cans and remain perfectly sharp.  Also called the ""ninja bomb,"" the missile has become the US munition of choice for killing leaders of extremist groups while avoiding civilian casualties.  That is apparently what happened with Zawahiri.  A US official told reporters that on the morning of July 31, Zawahiri was standing alone on the balcony of his Kabul residence, when a US drone launched the two Hellfires.  Apparent photographs of the building show windows blown out on one floor, but the rest of the building, including windows on other floors, still in place.  Members of Zawahiri's family were present in the home, but ""were purposely not targeted and were not harmed,"" the official said.

A struggling economy, the high cost of living, soaring poverty compounded by the Covid pandemic, drought in southern parts of the country and the death of a former strongman president all loom large.  The ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party, which has held power for nearly five decades in the oil-rich nation, is facing the most serious challenge since the country's first multiparty vote in 1992.  ""It's been 20 years of peace and we are still poor,"" said Lindo, a 27-year-old electrician who only gave his first name while queuing up to vote in a middle class suburb of Nova Vida. ""I'm going to vote for Unita. The people want change, the government doesn't provide for the basic needs of the people"".   Eight political parties are running, but the real contest lies between the MPLA and its long-standing rival and ex-rebel movement the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  Opinion polls suggest that support for the MPLA -- which won 61 percent of the vote in 2017 elections -- will dwindle, while the UNITA, which has entered an electoral pact with two other parties, will make gains.   But UNITA's inroads might not be enough to unseat Lourenco, who is expected to secure a second five-year mandate.   Still, it is unlikely to be a smooth swing back into office for the 68-year-old, who succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago.  ""The margins will be closer than ever before... but the advantages of incumbency mean MPLA is still odds on to pip Costa (Junior),"" said Eric Humphery-Smith, an analyst at London-based Verisk Maplecroft.    - 'An alternative' -    The MPLA has maintained its grip on the electoral process and public media in Angola, but the opposition tells its supporters not to be intimidated.  ""Don't be afraid of an alternative,"" Costa Junior told supporters at his final rally in the capital Luanda on Monday. ""There is no democracy with a single party in power.""  The 60-year-old Costa Junior who is popular among the youth  -- a significant and growing voting bloc -- pledges to ""eradicate poverty"" and create jobs.  His rival, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised to usher in a new era for Angola when he was first elected, has trumpeted a list of achievements to woo voters.  ""We made and restructured our economy,"" he told one of his final rallies in the capital at the weekend.   But little has changed for most of Angola's 33 million people for whom life is a daily grind in Africa's second largest crude oil producer.  The petro-dollars benefited the former president, the late dos Santos who died in Spain last month, his family and cronies.  The night-time and low-key repatriation of dos Santos's remains to Angola in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre element to the election.  Analysts warn that ruling party attempts to capitalise on dos Santos's funeral could backfire as opinions on his legacy are not ""unanimous"", especially among young people.  Some 14.7 million people are registered to vote at 13,200 polling stations across the vast southern African nation.  Angolans living overseas are for the first time able to cast ballots from abroad.  Polling opened at 7:00 am (0600 GMT) and ends 11 hours later.  Results are expected within a few days.

The conflict sparked fears of famine in poorer countries reliant on agricultural goods from Ukraine and Russia, two nations that were responsible for nearly a third of global wheat exports last year.  Wheat prices reached a peak of nearly 440 euros ($440) a tonne on the European market in mid-May, double the level of one year ago, as crucial Ukrainian shipments were stuck at port due to a Russian naval blockade in the Black Sea.  But prices have fallen to around 300 euros in August.  ""The situation began to calm down at the end of May, beginning of June with the first reassuring harvest forecasts for Europe and the resumption of Ukrainian exports, first by road and rail, then by sea,"" said Gautier Le Molgat, analyst at consultancy Agritel.  Kyiv and Moscow reached an agreement in July, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, that allowed Ukraine to resume grain shipments in the Black Sea.  The agreement opened a shipping corridor for 20 million tonnes of maize, wheat and sunflower seed oil stocked in Ukraine. According to the Joint Coordination Centre which manages the sea corridor, more than 720,000 tonnes have already left Ukraine.  ""Thanks to intensive international cooperation, Ukraine is on track to export as much as four million metric tonnes of agricultural products in August,"" a senior US State Department official told AFP on Tuesday.    - Strong ruble -    In addition to more supplies reaching markets and helping lower prices, the deal has led to a drop in insurance premiums, reducing transport costs.  But the reduction in tensions is, for the moment, benefitting Ukraine more than Russia, which is expecting a bumper harvest of 88 million tonnes of wheat.  Russian wheat exports in July and August are running 27 percent lower than last year, according to estimates by the Russian market research firm SovEcon.  That is due to fierce competition on the international grain market, as well as the strong value of the ruble and a high Russian export tax.   ""As a result, farmers remain reluctant sellers,"" said Andrei Sizov, SovEcon's managing director.   The low volume of Russian exports is one of the main reasons why wheat prices have remained so high, said Sizov.    - Fertiliser costs a growing problem -    One of the reasons prices have not come down further is the surge in energy prices, due to the post-pandemic recovery and the war.  Higher oil prices impact transportation costs, while natural gas is a feedstock for manufacturing the chemical fertilisers that most farmers now use.  ""Fertiliser prices have tripled in the last 18 months and the hard part of my job is forecasting what they will do in the next 18 months,"" Joel Jackson, a fertiliser analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said at an analyst conference in July in the United States.  With European gas prices soaring above 300 euros per megawatt hour, compared to an average of 20 euros over the past decades, ""we've got a big problem as it's untenable for ammonia manufacturers,"" said Nicolas Broutin, head of the French subsidiary of Yara, the Norwegian firm which is Europe's largest fertiliser producer.   Yara announced Thursday it was reducing once again its production in Europe of ammonia, which is made using hydrogen obtained from natural gas and which provides the nitrogen in synthetic fertilisers.  The firm will only be using 35 percent of its production capacity in Europe. A number of other European manufacturers have either reduced or halted output.  Although fertilisers do not fall under international sanctions, farmers are also at risk of shortages of another major element of fertiliser -- potassium or potash -- as both Russia and Belarus are major producers.   BMO Capital Markets' Joel Jackson said fertiliser manufacturers worry that the high prices will prompt farmers to reduce or eliminate their use.  ""We're already seeing that throughout Europe,"" said Yara's Nicolas Broutin.

The assault on the Hayat Hotel triggered a fierce gunfight between security forces and gunmen from the jihadist group who are still holed up inside the building, security official Abdukadir Hassan told AFP.  ""A huge blast went off a few minutes before the gunmen forced their way into the hotel,"" Hassan said.  ""We don't have the details so far but there are casualties, and the security forces are now engaging with the enemy who are holed up inside the building,"" he added.   Witnesses said a second blast occurred outside the hotel a few minutes after the first, inflicting casualties on rescuers and members of the security forces and civilians who rushed to the scene after the first explosion.  ""The area is cordoned off now and there is exchange of gunfire between the security forces and the gunmen,"" said one witness, Mohamed Salad.  The Al-Qaeda linked jihadist group, which has been waging a deadly insurgency against Somalia's fragile central government for about 15 years, claimed responsibility.  ""A group of Al-Shabaab attackers forcibly entered Hotel Hayat in Mogadishu, the fighters are carrying out random shooting inside the hotel,"" the group said in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website.    - US air raids -    Earlier this week, the United States announced that its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab fighters in an air strike in the central-southern part of the country as the Islamist militants were attacking Somali forces.  The US has carried out several air raids on the militants in strikes in recent weeks.  In May, President Joe Biden ordered the reestablishment of a US troop presence in Somalia to help local authorities combat Al-Shabaab, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump to withdraw most US forces.  In recent weeks,  Al-Shabaab fighters have also waged attacks on the Somalia-Ethiopia border, raising concerns about a possible new strategy by the Islamist militants.  Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said last month that ending Al-Shabaab's insurgency required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time is right.  Al-Shabaab fighters were driven out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force, but the group still controls swathes of countryside and has the capacity to wage deadly strikes on civilian and military targets.  Earlier this month, Somalia's new Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre announced the appointment of the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow, 53, publicly defected from Al-Shabaab in August 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5-million bounty for his capture.  nur/txw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

""We're not going to roll over and let this go. There's no way,"" says Sue Ianni, an official with the pro-Trump, pro-straight organization Super Fun Happy America, which chartered six buses carrying about 300 protesters for the demonstration in the US capital.  ""We will fight tooth and nail. This isn't over just if Biden gets inaugurated, if that happens. We'll never stop fighting. And Trump will be our president for the next four years, no matter who they inaugurate,"" she adds.  Despite Congress all but certain later Wednesday to certify the Electoral College results that determined Biden the winner of the presidential race, the busload of Trump supporters that AFP traveled with were in festive spirits.  Dressed in red ""MAGA"" sweaters, they took selfies and passed around snacks on the ten-hour trip. Even the driver wore a ""MAGA"" cap.  ""I've never had the opportunity to do something like this before,"" says Vincent Petroni, a young man who calls himself a member of the far-right Proud Boys group, whose leader was arrested in Washington on Monday for torching a Black Lives Matter banner.  ""Normally, I'm a very mellow guy. I don't like conflict,"" he adds.  ""And I'm not going there for conflict. But tensions are too high this day and age. Enough is enough. I need to go down, show my support -- support President Trump who supports the ideals that I stand for -- in a peaceful protest manner.""    - 'We won' -    Authorities fear the demonstration, attended by thousands of Trump supporters from across the country, could turn violent but Chau Keley, who chairs the Vietnamese-Americans for Trump organization says she is resolutely ""peaceful.""  She believes Trump won the November election ""by a landslide,"" despite Biden triumphing by 306 Electoral College votes to 232 and winning seven million more votes.   ""We are not sore losers, because we didn't lose, we won,"" she said, fueled by Trump's spurious claims of voter fraud.  Some dozed off during the trip but when the bus arrived at Washington's Union Station at 7:00 am they gleefully disembarked and headed towards the Capitol with a spring in their step and in high spirits.  It is there that Congress is expected to confirm Biden's win at a ceremony presided over by Vice President Mike Pence which starts at 1:00 pm (1800 GMT).

Sunday's election confirmed the immense popularity of centre-right President Rebelo de Sousa, who won the first round with 60.7 percent of the vote.  But it also heralded the meteoric rise of the party of Andre Ventura, a far-right anti-immigration candidate who captured almost 12 percent of the vote, just behind socialist Ana Gomes, who won about 13 percent.  Although Portugal is governed by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Antonio Costa, the president is more than a figurehead with a role over foreign policy and national security as commander of the armed forces and the power to dissolve parliament, call snap polls and veto some legislation.  In his victory speech Rebelo de Sousa pledged to make the fight against coronavirus his ""first priority"".  Portugal recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll on Sunday, with more than 85,000 infections and almost 1,500 deaths reported in the past week.  That is the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its population of more than 10 million, according to an AFP tally based on government figures.    - 'President reinforced his power' -    Rebelo de Sousa ""reinforced his power in an evening of political tumult,"" the respected Publico newspaper said on Monday.  The vote marks ""the consecration of the popularity and legitimacy"" of the president, Antonio Costa Pinto from the Institute of Social Sciences at Lisbon University said, but added that it also revealed ""the meteoric rise of the populist far-right.""  According to an opinion poll on Sunday, the Socialists are still the main political force in the country but without an absolute majority, which escaped them in legislative elections in October 2019.  The Social Democrats are facing an increasing challenge from the Chega (Enough) party which made history in 2019 by securing the first far-right seat in the Portuguese parliament, which was won by its founder Ventura, a former football commentator.  Analyst Costa Pinto said the election pointed to a major ""reconfiguration"" of the right as ""Chega has become a fundamental element for the establishment of a government of the right.""  He said Chega, founded less than two years ago, could ultimately play a role in toppling the Socialists, pointing to its burgeoning popularity with the electorate -- 20 percent of whom could be swayed by its rhetoric, according to him.  Ventura, an ally of France's Marine Le Pen and Italy's Matteo Salvini, warned after the election: ""There will be no government without Chega.""  Political expert Paula Espirito Santo from the Institute of Higher Social Sciences and Politics said Portugal ""has entered one of its most complex periods in recent history.""    - Second lockdown -    Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at stemming a surge in coronavirus cases.  Almost every day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants.  With an exploding pandemic and an ensuing social and economic crisis the president will ""have greater freedom"" to weigh in on national politics, Espirito Santo said.  Portugal had so far to a large degree not seen the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger European Union nations in recent years.  ""For the first time, an openly anti-system party has disrupted the traditional right, with nearly half a million votes,"" Ventura said Sunday as the ballots were being counted.  bur-tsc/lf/ach/mjs",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48861733']

The fire was raging in the Aragon region where around 300 firefighters are trying to contain the blaze with the help of helicopters.  At least 1,500 people were evacuated from the rural region that includes a natural park in the Zaragoza province, the regional government said.  The Aragon emergency services estimate ""thousands"" of hectares have been destroyed by the fire.  The ""rapid spread"" of the flames, stoked by winds, is ""critical"", the regional president, Javier Lamban, told media.

Fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab stormed the Hayat Hotel in Mogadishu on Friday evening in a hail of gunfire and bomb blasts, trapping scores of people.  Sporadic gunfire and loud explosions could still be heard early Saturday.  It is the biggest attack in Mogadishu since Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was elected in May after many months of political instability.  ""The security forces continued to neutralise terrorists who have been cordoned inside a room in the hotel building. Most of the people were rescued but at least eight civilians were confirmed dead so far,"" security commander Mohamed Abdikadir told AFP.  ""The security forces rescued dozens of civilians including children who were trapped in the building.""  Al-Shabaab, which has been waging a deadly insurgency against Somalia's fragile central government for about 15 years, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was still in control of the hotel Saturday.  Dozens of people have been gathering outside the four-storey hotel to discover the fate of loved ones.  ""We have been looking for a relative of mine who was trapped inside the hotel, she was confirmed dead together with six other people, two of them I know,"" said one anxious witness Muudey Ali.  There has been no official comment from the government about the attack.   - Two blasts -    Witnesses reported at least two large explosions as the gunmen stormed the hotel, a popular spot frequented by government officials and ordinary Somalis in a bustling area on the airport road.  Police spokesman Abdifatah Adan Hassan had told reporters late Friday that the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with several other gunmen.  Witnesses said a second blast occurred just a few minutes later, inflicting casualties on rescuers and members of the security forces and civilians who rushed to the scene after the first explosion.  The militants claimed responsibility in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website, saying its fighters were carrying out ""random shooting"" inside the hotel.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio on Saturday that its forces were still in control of the building and that they had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".

Robow, 53, publicly defected from Al-Shabaab in August 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5 million bounty for his capture.  The Horn of Africa nation has been mired in chaos since the fall of the military regime of President Siad Barre in 1991.  His ouster was followed by a civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.  The deadliest attack in Somalia occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in a bustling commercial district of Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  As well as the grinding jihadist insurgency, Somalia is also in the grip of a devastating drought that has driven one million people from their homes and left the country in the shadow of famine, according to the United Nations.  nur-txw/yad",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Six children were among those killed since the latest ""Israeli aggression"" began on Friday, while 275 people have been wounded, said health authorities in the enclave where several buildings were reduced to rubble.  The fighting is the worst in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the impoverished coastal territory, home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, and forced Israelis to seek shelter from rockets.  Israel pressed on with an intense aerial and artillery bombardment of positions of Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed group designated as a terrorist organisation by several Western nations, with the group firing hundreds of rockets in return since Friday.  ""I hear the bombing now,"" Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, told AFP. ""Every minute we receive injured people.""  Salmiya said that medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.

Medics in Israel said two people have been hospitalised by shrapnel wounds stemming from rocket attacks.    - 'Torn apart' -    Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said Cairo was talking with both sides ""around the clock"" to ease the violence.  In Gaza, run by the Islamist group Hamas, the health ministry said 31 people had been killed.  Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Gaza's northern Jabalia area on Saturday.  It was not immediately clear how many children were killed there, but an AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the local hospital including three minors.  ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   The army said it had struck 139 Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing 470 rockets that had crossed into Israel, while another 115 rockets fired from Gaza fell inside the enclave.  Al Quds Brigades, the Islamic Jihad's military wing, said it had ""fired rockets"" at Jerusalem for the first time in this round of violence.  Sirens wailed and explosions were heard as the army shot the projectiles down.  Amid the high tensions, Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem meanwhile marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.  Some Palestinians shouted ""God is greatest"" in response, but commemorations passed off without major incident.  Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation Friday against Islamic Jihad, claiming the group was planning an imminent attack.  The army has killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south.  Israel's Lapid called the killing of Mansour an ""extraordinary achievement"".    - 'Killing and wounding' -    Daily life in the Gaza Strip has come to a standstill, with the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said Sunday it only had enough fuel for its power generators to last two days before vital services would be cut.

Meanwhile, Hamas's response to the violence remains critical, with spokesman Fawzi Barhoum offering the group's support to Islamic Jihad on Sunday, but stopping short of saying they would take part.  ""The resistance in all its military wings and factions are united in this battle,"" Barhoum said.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently.

The man was shot through the neck, the ministry said in a statement.  Palestinian sources had earlier reported the wounding of 24-year-old Haroun Rasmi Abu Aram in the village of Al-Tuwanah, south of Hebron.   The man had been attempting to prevent the troops from ""stealing an electric generator"" that belonged to him, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA.  Israeli rights group B'Tselem said Abu Aram was helping a neighbour to build a house at the time of the shooting.   The Israel Defense Forces told AFP that a number of Palestinians had attacked its troops who were conducting a routine operation to evacuate an ""illegal building"" and had fired into the air in response.  An investigation into the incident was under way, the IDF added.   Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967 and its settlements in the area are regarded as illegal by much of the international community.   But the settler population has grown in recent years.   There are currently some 450,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, living among an estimated 2.8 million Palestinians.

Centre-right incumbent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who had been widely expected to win another term, took 61.6 percent of the vote, partial results covering 98 percent of constituencies showed.  Socialist challenger Ana Gomes came in second with 12.24 percent of the vote, ahead of far-right candidate Andre Ventura, who at this stage had 11.9 percent of the vote.   Opinion polls had pointed to a first-round victory for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator known for candid moments like queuing at the supermarket in shorts, plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized or sharing a meal with homeless people.  Turnout reached 35.4 percent by 1600 GMT, only slightly lower than at the same time five years ago, soothing fears that abstentions might top 70 percent.  In the capital Lisbon, voters queued outside polling stations, being let in one by one under coronavirus social distancing rules.  ""To those who can and who want to vote, overcome your fears,"" Rebelo de Sousa said after casting his ballot in Celorico de Basto, his stronghold in the northern region of Minho.    - National lockdown -    One voter, architect Jose Barra, 54, told AFP: ""Nothing would have stopped me from voting, but I think elderly people, for example, will be discouraged both by the virus and by the queues.""  As mail-in ballots are not well-established in Portugal, early voting was available last Sunday, drawing nearly 200,000 voters.  Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at stemming a surge in coronavirus cases.  The country recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll on Sunday, bringing fatalities to almost 10,500.  More than 85,000 infections and almost 1,500 deaths were reported in the past week, the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its population of more than 10 million, according to an AFP tally based on government figures.  Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants.    - Keep it to one round -    The president has the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power.  In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa -- often referred to simply by his first name -- urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round.  That would ""spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks"" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said.  ""An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable,"" the 72-year-old had warned.  Pre-election polls had given Rebelo de Sousa 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of Gomes and  Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent.  A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way.    - Far-right challenge -    Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government.  He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist.  Meanwhile, Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- ""Enough"" -- had said he was in the running to ""crush the Left,"" which fielded three out of the seven candidates.  Portugal has so far to a large degree not seen the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years.  Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.  bur-tsc/har/to",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48861733']

The election has been overshadowed by Angola's many woes -- a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought, compounded by the death of a former strongman president.  The People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which has ruled the oil-rich nation for nearly five decades, is facing its most serious challenge since the first multiparty vote in 1992.  ""It's been 20 years of peace and we are still poor,"" said Lindo, a 27-year-old electrician queueing up to vote in Nova Vida, a middle-class suburb of the capital Luanda.  ""The people want change -- the government doesn't provide for people's basic needs,"" said Lindo, who gave only his first name.   Eight political parties are running, but the real contest lies between the MPLA and its long-standing rival and ex-rebel movement the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  Opinion polls suggest that support for the MPLA -- which won 61 percent of the vote in 2017 elections -- will dwindle, while the UNITA, which has entered an electoral pact with two other parties, will make gains.   But UNITA's inroads might not be enough to unseat Lourenco, 68, who succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago.  ""The margins will be closer than ever before... but the advantages of incumbency mean MPLA is still odds on to pip Costa (Junior),"" said Eric Humphery-Smith, an analyst at London-based Verisk Maplecroft.    - Appeal to vote  -    The MPLA traditionally wields a grip over the electoral process and state media in Angola, but the opposition is urging supporters not to be intimidated.  ""This is a historic day,"" Costa Junior declared, after casting his ballot.  ""It is important that this day be a celebration,"" he said, urging ""full turnout and for all ballots to be counted.""  Lourenco urged citizens to come out and vote because ""in the end it's all of us who will emerge winners and it is democracy that wins"" he said after casting his ballot at Lusiada de Angola University in Luanda.  Opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering, and social media is rife with claims of dead people registered to vote.  Costa Junior, 60, is popular among young people -- a significant and growing voting bloc -- and has pledged to ""eradicate poverty"" and create jobs.  - Poverty and graft -  Lourenco, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised a new era for Angola when he was first elected, has trumpeted a list of achievements.  He is credited with making far-reaching reforms in one of southern Africa's economic powerhouses.   They include boosting transparency in the financial sector and efficiency in parastatal organisations, and promoting business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors. His government has managed to attract back global diamond miner De Beers, which had quit 10 years ago.  But little has changed for most of Angola's 33 million people for whom life is a daily grind.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza also nurtured corruption and nepotism under dos Santos, who died in Spain last month.  The low-key, night-time repatriation of his remains in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre touch to the election.   Dos Santos will be buried on Sunday, which would have been his 80th birthday.  Analysts warn that any MPLA attempts to capitalise on the funeral could backfire, given widespread anger over his legacy among young people.  Some 14.7 million people are registered to vote at 13,200 polling stations across the vast southern African nation.  Angolans living overseas are for the first time able to cast ballots from abroad.  Results are expected within a few days. In past elections, results have been contested, in a process that can take several weeks.  clt-sn/ri","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

The vote is heavy with consequences for Kansans, who will decide whether to remove the right to terminate a pregnancy from the traditionally conservative state's constitution.  But it is also seen as a test case for abortion rights nationwide, as Republican-dominated legislatures rush to impose strict bans on the procedure following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Turnout was high after polls opened at 7:00 am (1200 GMT), according to poll worker Marsha Barrett, who said some 250 voters had come to the station in Olathe by noon -- the same number it might see all day in a presidential election.   ""This election is crazy,"" Barrett told AFP. ""People are determined to vote.""  Other states including California and Kentucky are set to vote on the hot-button issue in November, at the same time as Congressional midterm elections in which both Republicans and Democrats hope to use it to mobilize their supporters nationwide.  In Kansas, the ballot centers on a 2019 ruling by the state's supreme court that guarantees access to abortion -- currently up to the 22-week stage of pregnancy.   In response, the Republican-dominated state legislature introduced an amendment known as ""Value Them Both"" that would scrap the constitutional right -- with the stated aim of handing regulation of the procedure back to lawmakers.  In the opposing camp, activists see the campaign as a barely masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban -- one state legislator has already introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest or the mother's life.   For Ashley All, spokeswoman for pro-abortion rights campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the amendment would deal a blow to ""personal autonomy.""  But voter Sylvia Brantley, 60, said she voted in favor of the change because she believes ""babies matter too.""  She said she wants to see more regulations, in the hope that ""Kansas will not be a marketplace for killing babies.""  Activists have complained that the phrasing of the ballot question is counterintuitive, and potentially confusing: Voting ""Yes"" to the amendment means abortion rights being curbed, while people who wish to keep those rights intact must vote ""No.""     - All eyes on Kansas -    Abortion rights advocates in Kansas are looking nervously to neighboring Oklahoma and Missouri, which are among at least eight states to have passed near-total bans -- the latter making no exceptions for rape or incest -- while Midwestern Indiana adopted its own rigid ban on Saturday.  Voter Aaron Stockton said he marked ""no"" on his ballot Tuesday afternoon.   ""I just feel that women have the right to choose,"" the 38-year-old told AFP at a polling station in the town of Lenexa.  ""Any changes I couldn't really understand fully, so I just want to keep it how I'm used to it,"" he said of the proposed constitutional amendment.  The outcome in Kansas could mean a boost or a blow to either side of the highly charged abortion debate.  Kansas leans heavily toward the Republican Party, which favors stricter abortion regulations, but a 2021 survey from Fort Hays State University found that fewer than 20 percent of Kansas respondents agreed that abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest.  caw/bfm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113334565']

Under the government decree, air conditioning must be turned down and set at no lower than 27 degrees Celsius (80.6 Fahrenheit) during the warmest months of the year in rules affecting everything from public transport to shops, offices, theatres and cinemas.  During the summer months, temperatures across Spain often hit 40C or higher.   The legislation also affects heating in winter, when temperatures can be set no higher than 19C.  ""The plan's aim is to save gas for the winter in case (Russian President Vladimir) Putin decides to cut off gas supplies to Europe as a result of sanctions... which could make this winter very difficult,"" Joan Groizard, head of the Energy Savings and Diversification Institute at Spain's ecology ministry, told public television.  Adopted last week, the legislation also requires that from 10:00 pm, shops switch off window-display lighting in a move also affecting the illumination of public buildings.   By the end of September, any air-conditioned or heated premises must have an automatic door-closing mechanism installed to avoid energy waste.  However, the law does not lay out any specific penalties and has left the task of monitoring compliance to Spain's 17 regions, some of which have been highly critical of the move, notably those run by the right-wing opposition People's Party.   Among the most critical has been Madrid's regional leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso, who has vowed to take the measure to Spain's Constitutional Court.   The government unveiled details of the plan in May as part of an EU-wide effort to cut dependence on Russia for oil and gas following its February invasion of Ukraine.   The European Commission is planning to cut EU dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies of the fuel before 2030.  An EU-wide plan to cut gas consumption came into effect on Tuesday with the aim of member states cutting back by ""at least 15 percent"" between August and March 2023 based on their average use over the past five years.

Police had failed to stop the underground event, set up on Thursday in two disused warehouses in Lieuron, south of the city of Rennes in Brittany.  Such mass gatherings are banned across France to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and a nationwide 8:00 pm curfew -- which was not lifted for New Year -- applies across the country.   Techno music had blared out during the night from the warehouses, which had been transformed into illegal nightclubs for partygoers who had flocked to the site from across France and even abroad.  The local prefecture said Saturday the music had been switched off and sound systems dismantled after two nights, and the first revellers began leaving the site before dawn.  By 10:15am the site was under the control of police, who had booked more than 800 people for failing to respect the curfew restrictions or wear masks or for ""participating in an illegal assembly"", it said in a statement.  Earlier Saturday, the prefecture said only ""a few hundred"" of the estimated 2,500 revellers remained, quoting an association that oversees the prevention and security risks of such events.  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin tweeted that the large police presence at the site had led to the breakup of the rave ""without violence"".    - 'Fierce hostility' -    Police on access roads were checking all those leaving the site, on foot or in vehicles, an AFP photographer said.  The officers were in particular on the lookout for narcotics, and were using torches to check the eyes of the ravers for signs of drugs use.  Police reinforcements continued to arrive and close off the site in a calm atmosphere Saturday morning, the photographer said.  About half of the car park at the site was empty early Saturday morning.  French authorities have been worried about mass rave parties throughout the pandemic, but New Year's Eve was a particular concern.  Police had Thursday night tried to ""prevent the event but faced fierce hostility from many partygoers"" who set one of their cars on fire and threw bottles and stones, the prefecture said on Friday.  First aid workers distibuted hand gel and masks to the revellers to try and limit the spread of the virus.  The French government, facing the threat of a new wave of Covid-19 infections, announced on Friday it is bringing forward its nighttime curfew by two hours in 15 regions to help combat the virus.  The country recorded around 20,000 new cases and 133 deaths on Friday, bringing the total number of fatalities to almost 64,800.  lg-gvy-cbo/lp/wdb/bp   Twitter",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104641253']

Kenyans are praying for a peaceful transition of power after almost a decade under President Uhuru Kenyatta, but concerns about vote-rigging linger in a nation still haunted by previous election disputes that descended into deadly violence.  More than 22 million have registered to vote in an election taking place against a backdrop of soaring prices for food and fuel, a punishing drought that has left millions hungry, and deep disenchantment with the political elite, particularly among the youth.  The deputy president and erstwhile heir apparent William Ruto, 55, is pitted against Raila Odinga, the 77-year-old veteran opposition leader now backed by Kenyatta after a stunning shift in political allegiances.  Before dawn in Odinga's stronghold in the lakeside city of Kisumu, voters in lines many hundreds of metres long queued in the dark outside polling stations as motorcyclists passed by honking and blowing whistles.  Moses Otieno Onam, 29, said woke up at 3:00 am to be near the front of the queue in Obunga, an informal settlement in the city centre.  ""I woke up early so that I go and choose my leader who might bring change. I have hope in that,"" he told AFP.  Polling stations opened from 6:00 am (0300 GMT) and are due to close at 5:00 pm (1400 GMT).  Analysts have in recent days suggested that Odinga, a onetime political prisoner and former prime minister who is making his fifth bid for the job, could narrowly edge past his younger rival.  But if neither wins more than 50 percent, Kenya would be forced to hold a run-off for the first time in its history.  Despite mudslinging on the hustings and widespread disinformation, campaigning passed off largely peacefully in contrast to previous polls.  Pressure is on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to ensure a free and fair vote in all six polls -- for the presidency as well as for senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  But already, the election has run into some hitches, with six IEBC officials arrested Monday and the commission suspending constituency or gubernatorial polls in several counties because of erroneous ballot papers.  IEBC head Wafula Chebukati vowed that the body would not hesitate to take ""stern action"" against any official flouting election laws.     - Beacon of stability -    Kenya's international partners are keenly watching the vote in a country considered a beacon of stability and democracy in a troubled region, with diplomats voicing cautious optimism it will pass off largely violence-free.  Both Odinga and Ruto have called for a peaceful vote, but fears remain that if the losing candidate challenges the outcome -- as widely expected -- the discord could erupt into street fighting.  Security is tight, with more than 150,000 officers being deployed.  The trauma of the 2007 election, which was followed by a horrific bout of politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, still looms large.  And Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result that saw then foe Kenyatta re-elected was met with a heavy-handed police response which left dozens dead.  The Supreme Court ordered a rerun in 2017, citing widespread irregularities in the counting process and mismanagement by the IEBC.  No presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002, and there will be an anxious wait for this year's results which are not expected for several days.  ""Kenya votes, East Africa holds breath,"" was the headline in The East African regional newspaper.  With neither Ruto nor Odinga belonging to the dominant Kikuyu tribe, which has produced three of the country's four presidents, the election will open a new chapter in Kenya's history.    - 'Jobs, jobs, jobs' -    Ruto, who said he once sold chickens on the roadside, has painted the election as a battle between ordinary ""hustlers"" and ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  Some observers say economic pressures could compete with tribal allegiances as the key factor driving voter behaviour in a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.  ""The reshaped electoral chessboard means the outcome will probably come down to the degree to which Odinga and Ruto can muster support outside their respective bases,"" the International Crisis Group's East and Southern Africa analyst Meron Elias said in a note.  Lawyers David Mwaure and George Wajackoyah -- the latter an eccentric former spy who wants to legalise marijuana -- are also running but are likely to trail far behind the frontrunners.  If Odinga wins, his running mate Martha Karua would become deputy president, the first woman to hold the post.  Both candidates have vowed to get the economy back on its feet, rein in Kenya's mammoth $70 billion debt mountain and tackle the corruption that infects every level of society.  Already hit hard by the Covid pandemic that threw hundreds of thousands out of work, Kenyans are now battling soaring inflation as the Ukraine war sends prices of basic necessities spiralling.  txw/mtp","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

The number of bombings across Afghanistan has dropped since the Taliban returned to power, but several attacks -- many targeting minority communities -- have rocked the country in recent months, including several claimed by the jihadist Islamic State group.  No group has yet claimed Wednesday evening's blast.  ""The blast was caused by explosives placed inside the mosque,"" Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran told AFP Thursday.  He said 21 people were killed and 33 wounded.  The Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said on Wednesday evening it had received 27 victims from the blast, including three fatalities.  Most of the patients were ""suffering from shell and burn injuries"", it said via email.  In a later tweet, the hospital said five children were among those it treated, including a seven-year-old.  Wednesday's blast comes nearly a week after a suicide attack killed top Taliban cleric Rahimullah Haqqani, who was killed along with his brother at his madrassa in Kabul.  Haqqani was known for angry speeches against IS, which later claimed the attack.  The group has primarily targeted minority communities such as Shiites, Sufis and Sikhs.  The Taliban say they have defeated IS, but experts claim the group remains a key security challenge for the hardline Islamists.  While IS is a Sunni Islamist group like the Taliban, the two are bitter rivals and greatly diverge on ideological grounds.  The blast came as senior Taliban leaders on Thursday led a major gathering of more than 2,000 religious clerics and elders in the southern city of Kandahar, the movement's de factor power base.

An Egyptian-proposed ceasefire had raised hopes that Cairo could help broker a deal to end the worst fighting in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the impoverished Palestinian coastal territory.  But Gaza's health ministry announced 10 more deaths late Sunday, among them nine children, raising the toll to 41 since fighting began on Friday.  The ministry said more than 300 people have been wounded in Gaza, which is run by the Islamist group Hamas.  Two Israelis have been injured by shrapnel over the same period, medics reported.  An AFP photographer saw two rockets being intercepted in the centre of Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv on Sunday evening.  Earlier in the day, an Egyptian security source said that Israel ""has accepted"" a ceasefire, adding that Cairo was waiting for the Palestinian response.  But a spokesman for Islamic Jihad -- an Iran-backed group designated as a terrorist organisation by several Western nations -- told AFP ""there is no agreement"" yet.  Musab al-Buraim listed the group's demands, including the release of senior leader Bassem al-Saadi, whose arrest in the occupied West Bank was announced by Israel on Tuesday.  Nour Abu Sultan, who lives west of Gaza, said she was ""awaiting the declaration of the ceasefire on tenterhooks"".  ""We haven't slept for days (due to) heat and shelling and rockets, the sound of aircrafts hovering above us... is terrifying,"" the 29-year-old said.    - Wounded people 'every minute' -    Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation.  Buildings have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, while Israelis have been forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets.  Dalia Harel, a resident in the Israeli town of Sderot close to the Gaza border, said she was ""disappointed"" at news of a truce despite her five children being ""traumatised"".  ""We're tired of having a military operation every year,"" she said. ""We need our military and political leaders to get it over with once and for all... we're not for war, but we can't go on like this.""  Islamic Jihad extended its barrage earlier Sunday to fire two rockets targeting Jerusalem, but they were shot down by the Israeli army.  The military has said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"".  Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said  medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.  ""Every minute we receive injured people,"" he said earlier Sunday.  The Gaza health ministry said 15 children were among the 41 dead.  But Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Gaza's northern Jabalia area on Saturday.    - Top militants killed -    An AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the hospital there, including three minors.  ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   The army said it had struck 139 Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing over 600 rockets and mortars, but with more than 100 of those projectiles falling short inside Gaza.  Amid the high tensions, Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.  Some Palestinians shouted ""God is greatest"" in response, and an AFP photographer was briefly detained by Israeli police, but commemorations passed without major incident.  Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation Friday against Islamic Jihad, which it said was planning an imminent attack.  The army has killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south.  In southern and central Israel, civilians were forced into air raid shelters. Two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others lightly hurt while running for safety, the Magen David Adom emergency service said.  Hamas's response to the violence remains critical, with spokesman Fawzi Barhoum offering the group's support to Islamic Jihad on Sunday, but stopping short of saying they would take part.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.  bur-pjm-rsc/lg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The fire began in the Grunewald forest in the early hours of the morning, with residents reporting a series of explosions.   Firefighters were initially unable to tackle the blaze directly due to the danger of further blasts, with emergency services setting up a 1,000-metre (3,280-foot) safety zone around the site.   Around 250 emergency personnel were deployed to the site.  The fire had spread across 50 hectares by the evening, according to police, but the emergency services were hoping to bring it under control overnight.  The most dangerous zones have been identified and firefighters have been cleared to proceed to within 500 metres of the blaze in some areas, they said.  The army had earlier sent in a tank aimed at evacuating munitions at the affected storage site as well as remote-controlled de-mining robots, while drones circled the air to assess the emergency.    - Heatwave -    Water cannons were also deployed around the safety zone to prevent the fire from spreading.  But authorities said no firefighting helicopters were available as they were already in use to tackle forest fires in eastern Germany.  They also said the 1,000-metre safety zone applied to the air, so there was a limit to how useful it would be to drop water on the fire from above.  Berlin mayor Franziska Giffey interrupted her holiday to visit the scene, calling the events ""unprecedented in the post-war history of Berlin"".  Giffey advised Berliners to close their windows but said the danger was minimal as there were no residential buildings within a two-kilometre (1.2-mile) radius and so no need to issue evacuation orders.  Road and rail traffic had been disrupted but was expected to return to normal in the course of the evening.   The fire came as a heatwave swept across Germany, with temperatures hitting 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Thursday.  Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves around the world more frequent and more intense, which increases the risk of fires.  Germany has suffered a series of forest fires this summer, with Brandenburg -- the state that surrounds Berlin -- among the hardest hit areas, along with the mountainous parts of Saxony state.    - Unexploded bombs -    Police said they were investigating what set off the fire in Grunewald.  The store holds munitions uncovered by police, but also unexploded World War II-era ordnance which is regularly dug up during construction works.  German media questioned the wisdom of having a bomb disposal site located in a major city.  ""At least 25 tons of World War II ammunition and illegal fireworks were hoarded at the munitions site there, in the middle of the forest. How can this be?"" Berlin newspaper BZ asked.  Cyclist Hellmut Schmidt, 64, who commutes through the forest to work, told AFP that ""when you see all these fires, of course you worry"".  ""But I don't know where else you could have (a munitions site) in Berlin... If it was further from the city, then it would also be dangerous with the transport because something could explode,"" he said.  Giffey said local authorities would ""have to think about how to deal with this munitions site in the future and whether such a place is the right one in Berlin"".  The German capital is rarely hit by forest fires, even though its 29,000 hectares of forests make it one of the greenest cities in the world.  Heavy thunderstorms are expected to sweep into the country from the west on Friday, the German weather service said.  A cold front is predicted to bring temperatures down by more than 10C overnight in western Germany, falling to around 20-25C on Friday.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113443286']

Taking its title from an acronym for child of deaf adult, ""CODA"" follows a high-school student (Emilia Jones) who is torn between pursuing her passion for music, and staying home to help her deaf parents and brother.  Apple purchased the film early in the US festival after a rapturous online response and an intense bidding war between distributors -- reportedly shelling out a Sundance record of $25 million.  ""I'm so excited, I'm so moved -- I want to try to sign and talk at the same time but it's hard,"" said director Sian Heder, accepting the award remotely.  ""CODA"" is based on French 2014 comedy ""La Famille Belier,"" transplanted to the US fishing town of Gloucester by Massachusetts native Heder (""Orange is the New Black."")  Both Heder and Jones learned to use sign language for the film, which features several prominent deaf actors in lead roles including Oscar-winner Marlee Matlin (""Children of a Lesser God."")  The film also won the top Sundance audience award, and prizes for directing and ensemble cast.   Musician Questlove's first movie ""Summer of Soul (...Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised),"" about the huge ""Black Woodstock"" festival that took place in 1969 Harlem, won jury and audience prizes for best documentary.  The film uses never-before-seen footage of the star-studded concert which was attended by 300,000 people and featured Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone and Mahalia Jackson, but has largely been lost to history until now.  ""Hive,"" about a woman fending for herself in patriarchal war-torn Kosovo, took world cinema drama prizes, while foreign documentary went to ""Flee"" -- an animation about a child refugee from Afghanistan, bought mid-festival by ""Parasite"" distributor NEON.  Top indie film festival Sundance was co-founded by Robert Redford and is typically held at Park City in the mountains of western state Utah.  But it took place largely online this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with all 72 feature films making their premieres via online streaming.  One of the final movies to feature Tuesday was ""Amy Tan: Unintended Memoir,"" a documentary about the author of bestselling Chinese-American immigrant novel ""The Joy Luck Club.""  It was directed by Redford's son James, a filmmaker and activist who died in October aged 58 from bile-duct cancer with the movie largely completed.  ""He was somebody I trusted so much... I felt he was never going to judge me, he was never going to pity me. He was just going to listen,"" said Tan.  Producer Karen Pritzker added: ""I am only sorry we're not in-person, and that Jamie isn't with us to celebrate.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104218016']

For the town located on the edge of the most important US army base in Europe, hope was revived in November by the election of Democrat Joe Biden as the next US president.  But much remains at stake for the community known as ""Little America"", whose prosperity has depended on the presence of US troops since the end of World War II 75 years ago.  ""Grafenwoehr is nothing without the US soldiers,"" said Piri Bradshaw, whose parents run an Irish pub in the town centre.  Establishments like this have become the life and soul of Grafenwoehr, where traditional barbers stand alongside tattoo parlours -- not to mention the many bars and restaurants that were doing a roaring trade before Covid-19 came along.  On one street corner, a BMW dealership offers a ""military discount"".  ""Imagine, we have seven supermarkets -- far too many for a town of 6,500 inhabitants,"" Bradshaw points out.  But someone has to feed the 40,000 soldiers and their families who live in and around the base.    - Roaring of gunfire -    In the town centre, a few old buildings still bear witness to Grafenwoehr's distant past as a quiet rural community -- but the roaring of gunfire quickly brings visitors back to the present.  ""We are used to it and sometimes don't even hear it anymore,"" said Birgit Ploessner, head of culture at the Military Museum, pointing out that a training camp was set up here as early as 1908.  The US set up a permanent base near the town after the defeat of the Nazis, but the country's overall military presence in Germany has declined from some 200,000 soldiers in 1990 to 34,500 today.  Although the prospect had been looming for years, President Donald Trump's decision to redeploy 12,000 soldiers from Germany -- including some 5,000 from Grafenwoehr and the neighbouring town of Vilseck -- still came as a shock.  Even a small reduction in troops would have ""serious"" economic consequences for the town, according to Grafenwoehr mayor Edgar Knobloch.  ""The base provides employment for more than 3,000 civilians in the region,"" he told AFP.   In addition, the troops spend about 660 million euros a year in the local community.  The election of Biden and the suspension of troop withdrawals pending further analysis by the Pentagon has been a great ""relief"" for the town, Knobloch said.   ""Our troubles are not over, but I am confident that the decision will be in our favour,"" he said.  Knobloch believes such a decision would also be in the interests of the US, which has invested heavily in recent years to modernise the base.  Soldiers are trained at Grafenwoehr before being sent on missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the armies of NATO member countries also train there regularly.    - Plastic Elvis -     And the base does not just have economic value. ""Three generations of US soldiers have followed one another here, sometimes even from father to son,"" said Ploessner.  They include the King himself, Elvis Presley, who did most of his military service in Germany.   During his time in Grafenwoehr, Presley even gave a private concert in a bar -- the only one in Europe in his entire career.   The town museum has lovingly recreated the scene with the original piano and a plastic Elvis.  The presence of the US soldiers permeates every aspect of cultural and social life in the town.  ""We celebrate US Independence Day like the Maibaum,"" Ploessner said, referring to a popular Celtic Maypole festival in Bavaria.  ""There is a real understanding between people here,"" adds Knobloch, with some soldiers even returning to settle in the area after they leave the army.  Raymond Tavarez Gascot is one of them. A year after retiring from the army, the Puerto Rico-born former paratrooper returned to Grafenwoehr in 2007, got married and fulfilled his dream of setting up a garage.  ""I fell in love with the country, the culture,"" said the 45-year-old, though he admits to still struggling with the language.  ""Yes I miss the weather, the beach, the sun,"" he said. But ""the reality is you can't compare the quality of life"".  ilp-fec/mfp/rl   CELTIC PLC    BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26773028', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96145859']"

The World Health Organization's Europe chief Hans Kluge branded the attacks ""unconscionable"".  As well as the 98 people known to have been killed in verified attacks on healthcare, at least 134 others were wounded, the WHO's figures showed.  Nearly 400 of the attacks hit health facilities. Dozens of attacks struck transport, including ambulances, while warehouses, supplies, personnel and patients were also damaged.  Jarno Habicht, the WHO's representative in Ukraine, said the number of attacks on health care was unprecedented.  ""These attacks are not only a violation of international law, they are also a barrier for many who need health care during the war,"" he told reporters in Geneva, via video-link from a bunker in Dnipro.  Although the war had had a devastating impact on the health and lives of Ukraine's people, the health system had not collapsed, said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  ""But no system can deliver optimum health to its people under the stress of war, which is why we continue to call on the Russian Federation to end this war,"" Tedros added.  These types of attacks in Ukraine had killed and maimed civilians and health providers alike, as well as denying treatment to those who need it the most, said the WHO.  Kluge paid tribute to the ""heroic efforts of health providers... despite their own personal suffering"".  Yevheniia Filipenko, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said that 19 out of 20 missiles that have struck the country in the past six months had hit civilian targets.

On Sunday, demonstrators defied government warnings and rallied across the country -- including in Moscow and Saint Petersburg where authorities enforced unprecedented lockdowns of the city centre -- in a second weekend of mass protests over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent.  The protests -- stretching from the Pacific port of Vladivostok to the northwestern city of Pskov -- came ahead of a high-profile court hearing that could see Navalny imprisoned for several years.  Navalny's detention and the crackdown on protesters has sparked an outcry in the West.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is expected to press the Kremlin to free Navalny when he heads to Moscow on Thursday.  Navalny, 44, is facing charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for embezzlement and could be jailed for two-and-a-half years.  The General Prosecutor's Office said in a statement on Monday that it backed a request by the prison service to change the suspended sentence to jail time.  ""This motion is considered lawful and justified,"" the statement said.   Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning.   He blames the attack with the Novichok nerve agent on Putin and the FSB security agency.    - Batons and tasers -    The anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a high-security detention centre and faces years of jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.  Navalny's team has urged his sympathisers to gather in front of the Moscow City Court on Tuesday to show support for the opposition politician, who is expected to appear in person, according to a court spokeswoman.  In recent years, Navalny has served a number of brief jail stints but never a long prison term.  On Sunday, thousands of people rallied across Russia to demand freedom for Navalny and changes to Russia's tightly-controlled political system.  OVD Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 5,400 people had been detained -- a record in the history of modern Russia.  Ahead of Sunday's demonstration, authorities locked down the centre of the capital, with hundreds of police lining the streets, central metro stations closed and restrictions on the movements of pedestrians.  Protesters and monitors pointed to the police's increasingly harsh tactics, saying they used batons and tasers on peaceful demonstrators, and some were badly beaten.  In Saint Petersburg, a policeman was seen aiming his service weapon at the protesters, while in Vladivostok police used non-lethal weapons against a demonstrator, according to OVD Info.  ""Political repression is ramping up,"" Leonid Drabkin, top OVD Info coordinator, told AFP.   Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday defended the clampdown.   ""We are talking about unlawful rallies,"" he told reporters. ""Naturally, police take measures against participants of these unlawful rallies -- hence the number of detained.""  - 'Path towards trouble' -    But the Saint Petersburg ombudsman said authorities unleashed ""essentially a military operation"" against protesters and paralysed the city.  ""Batons and tasers will not solve existing problems. Violence only breeds intransigence and engenders bitterness,"" ombudsman Alexander Shishlov said in a statement.  ""This is a path towards great trouble. It's time to stop.""  Kremlin critics say a concerted effort is under way to silence Navalny's team, dismantle his Anti-Corruption Foundation and pressure his family.  On Monday, a court fined Navalny's wife Yulia 20,000 rubles ($265) for participating in an ""unauthorised"" rally in her husband's support.  Ahead of Sunday's demonstrations, Navalny's brother Oleg and several key allies including prominent activist Lyubov Sobol were placed under house arrest until March 23 for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions and calling on people to join protests.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Twitter condemned ""the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists by Russian authorities for a second week straight"".  On Monday, France urged Germany to scrap the Nordstream II gas pipeline project with Russia in protest of Navalny's detention.  as-emg/lc",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

In a statement, the US Navy said the transit ""demonstrates the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""  Tensions in the Taiwan Strait soared to their highest level in years this month after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.   Beijing reacted furiously, staging days of air and sea exercises around Taiwan. Taipei condemned the drills and missile tests as preparation for an invasion.  Taiwan lives under constant threat of an invasion by China, which claims the self-ruled, democratic island as part of its territory to be seized one day -- by force if necessary.  Washington diplomatically recognizes Beijing over Taipei, but maintains de facto relations with Taiwan and supports the island's right to decide its own future.  The US Seventh Fleet said the pair of Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers -- the USS Antietam and the USS Chancellorsville -- conducted the ""routine"" transit on Sunday ""through waters where high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law.""  ""These ships transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State,"" a statement said.   ""The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows.""  The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) said the US had ""openly hyped up"" the ships' passage through the Strait.  ""The PLA Eastern Theatre Command is following and warning the US vessels throughout their entire journey, and is aware of all movements,"" spokesman Senior Colonel Shi Yi said.  ""Troops in the (eastern) theatre remain on high alert and are prepared at all times to foil any provocations.""  Taiwan's defense ministry confirmed a pair of warships sailed from north to south through the channel.  ""During their southward journey through the Taiwan Strait, the military is fully monitoring relevant movements in our surrounding sea and airspace, and the situation is normal.""    - 'Freedom of navigation' -    The Seventh Fleet is based in Japan and is a core part of Washington's navy presence in the Pacific.  The US and Western allies have increased ""freedom of navigation"" crossings by naval vessels of both the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea to reinforce the concept that those seas are international waterways, sparking anger from Beijing.  Washington has said its position on Taiwan remains unchanged and has accused China of threatening peace in the Taiwan Strait and using the visit by Pelosi as a pretext for military exercises.  China's drills included firing multiple ballistic missiles into waters off Taiwan -- some of the world's busiest shipping routes -- which was the first time Beijing has taken such a step since the mid-1990s.  Taiwan staged its own drills, simulating a defense against invasion and displaying its most advanced fighter jet in a rare nighttime demonstration.  Under President Xi Jinping, China's tone on Taiwan has grown more aggressive, with increased military activity and more combative messaging in recent years.  bur-je/aha",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109260060']

The fire broke out on Thursday on the second floor of an illegal care home in Kharkiv, the second-largest city of the ex-Soviet republic, killing 15 people and injuring several others.  The country's Prosecutor-General Iryna Venedyktova said on Facebook that ""four people were detained"", including the owner of the two-storey building, the tenant and his wife, who was the director of the care home.   They also detained the administrator of the nursing home.   Investigators are currently looking into three potential causes of the fire: arson, misuse of electric devices and a short circuit.

The army sent in a tank aimed at evacuating munitions at the affected storage site as well as remote-controlled de-mining robots, while drones were circling the air to help assess the emergency.  The situation is ""extremely extraordinary with munitions,"" said Berlin fire brigade spokesman Thomas Kirstein, adding that it was ""under control and there was no danger for Berliners.""   The fire was however expected to last for some time, he said.  Firefighters called to the site in the middle of the night were confronted with intermittent blasts that sent debris flying and hindered their work.   They have so far been able to begin tackling only two of the four hotspots across the affected area of 15,000 square metres (161,500 square feet), as explosions at the munitions store were still rocking the area.  No one has been hurt by the fires, which came on a day when a new heatwave was due to envelop Germany.  Officials have built a security cordon to allow firefighters to start working around a kilometre from the ammunition storage zone.   The store holds munitions uncovered by police, but also unexploded World War 2-era ordnance which is regularly dug up during construction works.  Police said they were investigating what set off the fire.  Authorities appealed for the public to avoid the forest, popular with both locals and tourists, as several regional rail lines have been halted.  But authorities said no firefighting choppers were available as they were already in use to calm forest fires in eastern Germany.    - Heatwave -    The German capital is rarely hit by forest fires, even though its 29,000 hectares of forests make it one of the greenest cities in the world.  Brandenburg, the region surrounding Berlin, as well as parts of eastern Germany have for days been battling forest fires.

The British author, who spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders ordered his killing, underwent emergency surgery and was placed on a ventilator following Friday's assault in which a 24-year-old man, Hadi Matar, rushed the stage where Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture and stabbed him in the neck and abdomen.  Matar, from New Jersey, was taken into custody and formally charged with attempted murder, but police provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.  According to Rushdie's agent Andrew Wylie, the nerves in one of the novelist's arms were severed, his liver damaged, and he ""will likely lose one eye.""   Rushdie, 75, had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran's then supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.  The fatwa followed publication of the novel ""The Satanic Verses"" which sparked fury among some Muslims who believed it was blasphemous.  - Assailant raised in US -    Rushdie moved to New York in the early 2000s and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  In an interview with Germany's Stern magazine just weeks before the attack, Rushdie spoke of how, after so many years living with the threat of the fatwa, his life had largely returned to normal since moving to the United States.  Security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community in western New York state.  Witnesses said Rushdie was seated on an auditorium stage and preparing to speak when Matar jumped up from the audience and managed to stab him several times before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators.  Matar's family apparently came from a border village called Yaroun in southern Lebanon. An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there. Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.  Matar was ""born and raised in the US,"" the head of the local municipality, Ali Qassem Tahfa, told AFP.  ""The Satanic Verses"" and its author remain deeply inflammatory in Iran and, when asked by AFP on Saturday, nobody in Tehran's main book market dared to openly condemn the stabbing.  ""I was very happy to hear the news,"" said Mehrab Bigdeli, a man in his 50s studying to become a Muslim cleric.  The message was similar in Iran's conservative media, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""  In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan -- a party that has staged violent protests against what it deems to be anti-Muslim blasphemy -- said Rushdie ""deserved to be killed.""  Elsewhere there was widespread shock and outrage, along with expressions of support and solidarity for the writer.  British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" while US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack ""reprehensible"" and ""cowardly"".  Messages also flooded in from the literary world, with J.K. Rowling tweeting her shock at the ""horrifying"" assault and Rushdie's close friend and fellow Booker Prize winner Ian McEwan calling him an ""inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world.""  Rushdie was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel, ""Midnight's Children"", in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  - Wrote memoir in hiding -    But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" transformed his life when the resulting fatwa forced him into nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell even his children where he lived.  Even as the need for constant security began to diminish in the late 1990s, threats and boycotts continued against literary events that Rushdie attended.  Since moving to New York Rushdie has been an outspoken advocate of freedom of speech and continued writing -- including a  memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  bur/dw       THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Revenue more than doubled to $8.1 billion in the three months through June, a 105 percent increase, at a time when many tech companies are struggling to navigate global economic turbulence.  Still, the firm posted a net loss of $2.6 billion, but investors shrugged it off and shares closed up about almost 19 percent on Wall Street.  Uber primarily attributed the loss to the falling value of its investments in financially strapped companies such as Singapore's VTC Grab, US self-driving vehicle start-up Aurora and Indian food delivery service Zomato.  The ride hailing giant also reported it now has nearly five million drivers and couriers on its platform, a 31 percent increase from last year.   Some 70 percent of drivers coming to the platform said inflation played a part in their decision, as people look for additional income to offset price increases, the firm reported.  ""We saw an acceleration in both active and new driver growth in the quarter,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said. ""Against the backdrop of elevated gas prices globally, this is a resounding endorsement.""    - Bumpy earnings season -    Uber also notched gains in monthly active platform consumers, gross bookings and trips compared with a year ago, reflecting higher demand but also a higher number of drivers for its signature ride service and food delivery operations.  ""We continue to benefit from an... increase in the on-demand transportation of people and things,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""We intend to continue capitalizing on these growth tailwinds.""  Analysts noted that the relatively robust earnings were well above expectations, a relief during an earnings season buffeted by inflation, economic uncertainty and the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Consumers are still moving to the Uber platform especially as travel, shifting to the office, and other post-pandemic trends take hold globally,"" wrote analyst Dan Ives.  The California-based firm posted $1.8 billion in revenue from its freight operations, and said income figures got a boost from a change in how it accounts for its rides business in Britain.   The latest earnings season has been marked both by investors being relieved when results weren't as bad as feared, but also backing away from companies with less clear futures.  Facebook owner Meta and messaging app Snapchat's parent company both saw shares fall after results showed their ad-driven models were vulnerable to the current economic uncertainty.  But giants like Apple and Amazon reassured markets last week with better than expected results on strong demand and sales.  bur-dho-jm/bfm   Uber    Meta    AMAZON.COM",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96016136']

The vote is heavy with consequences for Kansans, who will decide whether to remove the right to terminate a pregnancy from the traditionally conservative state's constitution.  But it is also seen as a test case for abortion rights nationwide, as Republican-dominated legislatures rush to impose strict bans on the procedure following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Turnout was high after polls opened at 7:00 am (1200 GMT), according to poll worker Marsha Barrett, who said some 250 voters had come to the station in Olathe by noon -- the same number it might see all day in a presidential election.   ""This election is crazy,"" Barrett told AFP. ""People are determined to vote.""  Other states including California and Kentucky are set to vote on the hot-button issue in November, at the same time as Congressional midterm elections in which both Republicans and Democrats hope to use it to mobilize their supporters nationwide.  In Kansas, the ballot centers on a 2019 ruling by the state's supreme court that guarantees access to abortion -- currently up to the 22-week stage of pregnancy.   In response, the Republican-dominated state legislature introduced an amendment known as ""Value Them Both"" that would scrap the constitutional right -- with the stated aim of handing regulation of the procedure back to lawmakers.  In the opposing camp, activists see the campaign as a barely masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban -- one state legislator has already introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest, or the mother's life.   For Ashley All, spokeswoman for pro-abortion rights campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the amendment would deal a blow to ""personal autonomy.""  Activists also complain that the phrasing of the ballot question is counterintuitive, and potentially confusing: voting ""Yes"" to the amendment means abortion rights being curbed, while people who wish to keep those rights intact must vote ""No.""   First-time voter Morgan Spoor knew she wanted to vote ""no"" to support ""the right to choose.""  ""I really want my word out there, especially as a female,"" the 19-year-old told AFP. ""I don't think anyone can say what a woman can do with their body.""    - All eyes on Kansas -    Abortion rights advocates in Kansas are looking nervously to neighboring Oklahoma and Missouri, which are among at least eight states to have passed near-total bans -- the latter making no exceptions for rape or incest -- while Midwestern Indiana adopted its own rigid ban on Saturday.  Kara Miller Karns, a voter in Leawood, said she planned to vote for the status quo on Tuesday, saying it was ""not acceptable"" for her daughters to grow up with fewer rights than she did.   But in the same Kansas neighborhood, 43-year-old Christine Vasquez said she planned to back the constitutional amendment -- in hope it would clear the way for a future vote on an abortion ban.  ""I believe that life starts at conception,"" she told AFP ahead of the ballot.  The outcome in Kansas could mean a boost or a blow to either side of the highly charged abortion debate.  Kansas leans heavily toward the Republican Party, which favors stricter abortion regulations, but a 2021 survey from Fort Hays State University found that fewer than 20 percent of Kansas respondents agreed that abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest.  caw/sw/sst",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113334565']

US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick was reportedly struck in the head with a fire extinguisher on Wednesday while struggling with the rioters who swarmed through the halls of Congress.  The 42-year-old member of the force that protects the ground of the Congress returned to his division office where he collapsed and was taken to the hospital, according to the Capitol Police.  He died of his injuries late Thursday, they said.  According to reports, the FBI will open a murder investigation into his death.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered flags over the Capitol lowered in his honor.  ""The violent and deadly act of insurrection targeting the Capitol, our temple of American Democracy, and its workers was a profound tragedy and stain on our nation's history,"" she said in a statement.  ""The sacrifice of Officer Sicknick reminds us of our obligation to those we serve: to protect our country from all threats foreign and domestic.""  Four others, all associated with the protests in support of Trump's unsupported claim that he won the November 3 election, also died on Wednesday.  Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35 and a fervent backer of the president from San Diego, California, was shot dead by a Capitol Police officer inside the Capitol building Wednesday.  With a Trump flag wrapped around her, she was at the front of a crowd attempting to batter through an internal doorway when the officer on the other side fired one shot which struck her.  Three others died on the Capitol grounds, police said, of ""medical emergencies.""  The two men and one woman were also there to protest for Trump.

Soldiers swarmed the streets of the capital and authorities blocked access to social media after one of the most violent election campaigns in years.  Some 18 million voters are registered for the presidential and parliamentary vote, which will unfold in nearly 35,000 polling stations.  Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  The rise of opposition frontrunner Bobi Wine, a 38-year-old singer-turned-lawmaker who has cultivated a popular youth following, has rattled Museveni, and fuelled fears he will do whatever it takes to hold onto power.  On the eve of the vote, armoured-personnel carriers with mounted machine guns patrolled parts of Kampala and army helicopters and surveillance drones flew over the teeming capital where the political opposition has traditionally enjoyed support.  The military build-up has fanned fears of further election-related violence.  In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces loyal to Museveni during protests against one of Wine's numerous arrests.  ""I think this time with a lot of pressure... there might be a lot of violence,"" said Charles Abigaba, an accountant in Kampala.  ""Since the campaign has been (on) everyone is worried,"" said Andrew Kiiza, a driver.    - Hopes and threats -    The run-up to polling day was marred by a sustained crackdown on Museveni's rivals and government critics, and unprecedented attacks on the nation's media and human rights defenders.  The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  In a statement, US ambassador Natalie Brown warned the refusal meant the election ""will lack the accountability, transparency and confidence"" brought by independent oversight.  On Tuesday, Museveni announced the suspension of social media networks and messaging services like Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp in response to Facebook closing accounts linked to government officials the tech giant said were spreading misinformation.  Wine is the strongest of 10 opposition contenders trying to unseat Museveni.  But most observers expect the ageing president and his ruling National Resistance Movement to emerge victorious.  He has never lost an election, and has been counting down the days to victory in confident campaign advertisements, promising to invest more in infrastructure, health and education and build Uganda's economy.  But Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has accused the president of presiding over corruption and failing to deliver jobs.    - Generation gap -    The population has a median age of less than 16, and many Ugandans have never known anyone but Museveni in charge.  ""This time around, we hope there might be a change. We hope,"" said Abigada.  Wine has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen. The opposition leader has urged them to turn out in large numbers and vote, saying they should not fear intimidation by the authorities.  Museveni, who has suggested Wine is supported by foreign and criminal elements, warned his opponents against taking to the streets.  ""If you use violence to protest against an election result, that is treason,"" Museveni warned in a national address Tuesday.  Polls are open from 7:00am-4:00pm (0400-1200 GMT). Results are expected by Saturday evening.  str-np/fb/ri   FACEBOOK    Twitter","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

The number of bombings across Afghanistan has declined since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but several attacks -- many targeting minority communities -- have rocked the country in recent months, including some claimed by the jihadist Islamic State group.  No group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday evening's blast at Kabul's Sediqia Mosque, which has an adjoining madrassa.  ""He was my cousin; may God forgive him,"" said a neighbourhood resident who gave his name as Masiullah, describing how he learnt of a relative's death in the blast.  ""One year had passed from his marriage, he was 27 years old and his name was Fardin... he was a good person.""  Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran said 21 people were killed and 33 wounded.  The Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said Wednesday evening it had received 27 victims, including three fatalities.  Most of the patients were suffering ""shell and burn injuries"", it said via email.  In a later tweet, the hospital said five children were among those it treated, including a seven-year-old.  Local hospitals contacted by AFP said they were not permitted to provide details of casualties they had treated.  - Downplay incidents -    Taliban officials insist they have full control of security in the country, but frequently deny or downplay incidents reported on the country's vibrant social media.  They have also taken recently to preventing local and foreign media from covering the aftermath of attacks -- sometimes violently -- and on Thursday armed Taliban fighters prevented journalists from reaching the mosque site.  Wednesday's blast comes nearly a week after a suicide bomber killed top Taliban cleric Rahimullah Haqqani, along with his brother, at his madrassa in Kabul.  Haqqani was known for angry speeches against IS, which later claimed the attack.  The group has primarily targeted minority communities such as Shiites, Sufis and Sikhs.  The Taliban say they have defeated IS, but experts claim the group remains a key security challenge for the hardline Islamists.  While IS is a Sunni Islamist group like the Taliban, the two are bitter rivals and greatly diverge on ideological grounds.  The blast came as senior Taliban leaders on Thursday led a major gathering of more than 2,000 religious clerics and elders in the southern city of Kandahar, the movement's de facto power base.   In a statement sent to the media, a Taliban spokesman said ""important decisions"" would be taken at the conference but provided no other details.  The Taliban on Monday marked the first anniversary of their return to power following a turbulent year that saw women's rights crushed and a humanitarian crisis worsen.  Initially, they promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, but many restrictions have gradually been imposed.  The country is in economic crisis, with its overseas assets frozen by Washington and aid curtailed in order to keep funds out of the Taliban's hands.  No country has officially recognised the new government.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113551461', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113550033']"

Trump, who is weighing another White House run in 2024, supported the release of the search warrant while complaining that he was the victim of ""unprecedented political weaponization of law enforcement.""  ""I am going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents, even though they have been drawn up by radical left Democrats and possible future political opponents,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.  The 76-year-old Trump and his lawyers have actually had a copy of the search warrant and the receipt listing the property seized by FBI agents for days and they could have revealed the contents previously themselves.  The FBI search on Monday of Trump's Mar-a-Largo residence was believed to be focused on classified papers that may have been removed from the White House, with one report suggesting they included documents related to nuclear weapons.  The highly unusual move to unseal the search warrant was announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland -- the country's top law enforcement officer -- who said he had ""personally approved"" the raid on Trump's home.  Garland said he had asked a Florida judge to unseal the warrant because of ""substantial public interest in this matter"" and he gave Trump and his legal team until 3:00 pm (1900 GMT) Friday to oppose the motion.  Andrew Weissmann, a former Justice Department official, said Garland had ""called Trump's bluff"" by putting the onus on the former president to object or consent to release of the document.   The Justice Department motion to unseal the warrant noted -- and did not dispute -- statements by Trump's representatives that the FBI was seeking presidential records and potential classified material.  According to US media, the search related to potential mishandling of classified documents taken to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left the White House in January 2021.  The Washington Post on Thursday cited anonymous sources close to the investigation as saying classified documents relating to nuclear weapons were among the papers sought by FBI agents during the raid.  Trump himself appeared to deny the claim, posting that the ""nuclear weapons issue is a hoax"" and even suggesting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation might have been ""planting information"" at his home.     - Political firestorm -    The FBI raid sparked a political firestorm in an already bitterly divided country, and comes as Trump hints at making another presidential bid in 2024.  Leading Republicans have rallied around Trump and some members of his party accused the Justice Department and FBI of partisanship in targeting the ex-president.  In a statement on Thursday, Trump said his attorneys had been ""cooperating fully"" and ""the government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it.""  Garland criticized what he called ""unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department agents and prosecutors.""  In the hours before Garland's remarks, an armed man tried to storm an FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio in an attack that appeared to be a direct response to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.  The assailant, who was shot dead by police after exchanges of gunfire and an hours-long standoff, reportedly posted on Truth Social that he hoped his actions would serve as a ""call to arms.""  The Justice Department typically does not confirm or deny whether it is investigating someone, and Garland took pains to emphasize the law was being applied fairly to Trump.  In addition to investigations into his business practices, Trump faces legal scrutiny for his efforts to overturn the results of the November 2020 election and the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.  Trump was impeached for a historic second time by the House after the Capitol riot -- he was charged with inciting an insurrection -- but was acquitted by the Senate.  cl/bgs",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Standing on the steps of a US Capitol that was ransacked exactly two weeks earlier by pro-Trump mobs seeking to overturn his victory, Biden swore the presidential oath on a bulging century-old family Bible moments after Kamala Harris officially became America's first woman vice president.  ""Democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,"" Biden said before a National Mall that was virtually empty due to the ultra-tight security and a raging Covid-19 pandemic that he vowed to confront swiftly.  ""We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility and we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes,"" he said.  ""Together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear, of unity, not division, of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing and goodness.""  But Trump, who falsely said that he was cheated out of a second term and egged on his supporters before their deadly rampage at the Capitol, broke 152 years of tradition by refusing to attend his successor's inauguration.  Biden pushed through a flurry of orders the moment he entered the White House, starting with rejoining the 2015 Paris climate accord, from which the US withdrew under Trump, an ally of the fossil fuel industry.  ""We are going to combat climate change in a way we have not done so far,"" the new US leader said in the Oval Office as he signed papers on the Paris deal, which was negotiated by Barack Obama when Biden was his vice president.  Biden's spokeswoman Jen Psaki said his first call to a foreign leader would be on Friday to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- after Biden blocked the Keystone XL pipeline fiercely opposed by environmentalists but backed by Ottawa.  Biden also halted the US exit from the World Health Organization, stopped construction of Trump's cherished wall on the Mexican border and rescinded a ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority nations.  ""As a nation built on religious freedom and tolerance, we welcome people of all faiths and those of no faith at all. It is who we are,"" said the new State Department spokesman, Ned Price.    - 'President for all Americans' -    In his inaugural address, Biden appealed to supporters of Trump, who shattered political norms by ruthlessly belittling rivals, denouncing entire ethnic groups and trying to cast doubt on basic facts.  ""I will be a president for all Americans,"" the veteran Democrat said.  But Biden confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as evidenced during Trump's presidency by the Capitol assault, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants, and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.  The United States faces ""a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat,"" Biden said.  ""Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear and demonization have long torn us apart.""  At 78, Biden is the oldest-ever US president, a job he first sought in 1987, and is only the second Roman Catholic president after John F Kennedy.   Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history, and the first Black person and first person of Asian heritage as the nation's number two.   She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever ""second gentleman"" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who became a hero by luring away the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers.  Thanks to the new vice president's tie-breaking vote, the Democratic Party regained control of the Senate, which confirmed the first of Biden's nominees, national intelligence chief Avril Haines.    - Empty Washington -    Washington took on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops who sealed off the city center.  With the public essentially barred from attending the proceedings, Biden's audience instead was 200,000 flags planted to represent the crowds absent from the National Mall.  Biden, who has vowed a major escalation in the nation's Covid vaccination drive, warned that the ""toughest and deadliest period"" was still ahead.   So far, more than 400,000 people have died of Covid in the United States, more than in any other country.  ""We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation,"" he said, striking a new tone after Trump's mockery of mask-wearing and business closings meant to halt the virus.  While the public crowds were gone, Biden brought in celebrity power -- absent four years ago with Trump.  Lady Gaga, in a dress with a black bodice and a billowing red skirt, sang the national anthem and Jennifer Lopez gave a pop rendition of ""This Land is Your Land,"" ending by exclaiming the final words of the pledge of allegiance -- ""one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"" -- in Spanish.  The new first lady, Jill Biden, invited a 22-year-old poet, Amanda Gorman, who became a star of the day with verse on how democracy ""can never be permanently defeated.""  In lieu of inaugural balls, Biden joined a prime-time television broadcast from the Lincoln Memorial that featured Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, a number of Broadway stars and Justin Timberlake -- some live at the monument, but many of them appearing from remote locations.  Biden and Harris started their administration by jointly paying respects to fallen soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery followed by an inaugural parade -- without spectators -- that featured both an Army fife and drum corps in the red coats of George Washington's time, and a drumline and dancers from Howard University, the historically Black institution that counts the new vice president as a graduate.    - Trump vows to be back -    Trump left Washington hours before the inauguration, walking on a red carpet on the White House lawn with his wife Melania into the Marine One presidential helicopter, which flew near the inauguration-ready Capitol before heading to Andrews Air Force Base.  ""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters at a campaign-style event with cannons before leaving for his Florida resort in his last trip on Air Force One.  ""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.  In a first hint of graciousness, Trump wished the next administration ""great luck and great success"" -- without saying Biden's name.  Biden said that Trump left him a traditional letter that was ""very generous"" but declined to reveal the contents.  In the middle of his last night at the White House, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 73 people including close allies and lifted a ban on his administration's officials serving as lobbyists -- an order he had issued at the start of his presidency as he vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington.  bur-sct/sst",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Shortly after ousting the government and taking power in 1986, Museveni declares: ""The problem of Africa in general, and Uganda in particular, is not the people, but leaders who want to overstay in power.""  Museveni receives early praise for returning some stability and prosperity to Uganda, which after years of coups, violent tyrants and civil war is among the world's poorest countries.  He is returned to office in 1996 in the country's first direct presidential election since independence from Britain in 1962.    - Darling of the West -     Uganda's economy grows rapidly in the 1990s as Museveni undertakes sweeping reforms, pleasing foreign donors and financial lenders keen to sponsor a burgeoning African success story.  Museveni's early successes combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic and reducing poverty burnish this image in the West as a modern African leader committed to good governance.  But his moral standing takes a particular hit when Uganda and Rwanda invade the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) twice in the late 1990s. Both armies are later charged in The Hague with looting Congo's resources, killing and torturing civilians and using child soldiers.  Museveni would also be accused of supporting rebels in the region -- an allegation that would resurface time and time again during his long tenure.    - Broken promises -    In 2001, Museveni defeats his main opposition rival Kizza Besigye at the ballot box, and commits to standing down at the next election.   But instead, he changes the constitution in 2005 to do away with presidential term limits.  The following year -- his 20th in power -- he again defeats a popular Besigye in a vote marred by violence and irregularities.  That same year, the Lord's Resistance Army is largely driven out of northern Uganda after a grinding and brutal 20-year insurgency -- although Ugandan troops hunt the rebel leadership in Sudan, DRC and Central African Republic for another decade.  Museveni pleases Washington -- a close friend which has provided Uganda billions in foreign aid -- by sending troops to serve under the US in Iraq and to Somalia, where they form the backbone of an African Union mission to confront Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists Al-Shabaab.    - Drift toward autocracy -     In 2010 the UN accuses Ugandan troops of war crimes in eastern Congo. Uganda threatens to withdraw its peacekeepers from Somalia, South Sudan, Darfur, Ivory Coast and East Timor -- a trump card it would use again in future when accused of further meddling in DRC.  Museveni wins a fourth term in 2011 over Besigye, who again decries the vote as a sham. Not long after, security forces are deployed to violently suppress major street protests as food and fuel prices soar and the economy teeters.  Ugandan troops fight alongside South Sudan's forces as the new country descends into civil war in 2013. At home, the crackdown on critics intensifies, with radio stations taken off air and newspapers raided for airing suggestions Museveni is grooming his son for succession.  In 2014, Museveni signs a controversial anti-gay bill into law, drawing resounding criticism from around the globe, and attracting US sanctions and a freeze on EU donor funds.    - President for life -     ""I am not power-hungry, but mission-hungry"" Museveni said in 2015, describing the economic transformation of Uganda as his only purpose, and vowing to return to cattle-keeping should he lose the election the following year.  But he won that, too, and proceeded in 2017 to change the constitution once more. This time he removed age limits for presidential candidates, clearing his path to run for a sixth term in 2021, aged 76, and reinforcing fears he plans to rule for life.  However, the veteran leader faces an energised campaign by a young opposition upstart called Bobi Wine, a musician-turned-MP who openly calls Museveni a dictator, and blames the endemic corruption under his rule for contributing to Uganda's high youth unemployment and bleak economic outlook.  Museveni, whose increasingly violent reprisals against Wine have drawn global condemnation, has accused outsiders and ""homosexuals"" of backing the neophyte opposition leader, and is expected to win the January 14 vote that observers say will be neither free nor fair.  np/fb/dl","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Drawing a curtain on the most tumultuous administration of modern times, Trump is being ousted by a polar opposite with the Democrat Biden intent on charting a new course to tackle Covid-19 and unite a splintered nation.  Trump, 74, and first lady Melania Trump walked a short red carpet and boarded the Marine One helicopter, which flew near the Capitol that was ready for Biden's inauguration before heading to Andrews Air Force Base on Washington's outskirts.  ""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters in a campaign-style event before flying off for the last time in Air Force One en route to his Florida resort.  ""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.  Trump -- who for two months has falsely alleged election fraud -- did not address Biden by name but, in a rare hint of graciousness, wished the next administration ""great luck and great success.""  While a spokesman said the president had left a letter for Biden, Trump is the first sitting president since 1869 to skip the inauguration of his successor.  Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office at noon (1700 GMT) at the very spot where pro-Trump rioters clashed with police two weeks ago before storming Congress in a deadly insurrection.  Official Washington has taken on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat of this month's attack.  And with the pandemic raging, the general public is essentially barred from attending the swearing-in, leading to the unprecedented sight of an empty National Mall on Inauguration Day.  With the death toll soaring past 400,000, Biden led a powerful tribute to victims of Covid-19 as he arrived in Washington on the eve of his swearing-in.  ""It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" Biden said in somber remarks in front of the Lincoln Memorial, once more stressing the need to unite the country after Trump's chaos.  On the Mall's grassy expanse, some 200,000 flags have been planted to represent the absent crowds at the inauguration.    - Last-minute Trump pardons -    In one of his last acts before departing the White House, Trump issued scores of pardons to people convicted of crimes or facing charges, including several key allies.  Influential former Trump aide Steve Bannon -- charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall, a flagship Trump policy -- was among 73 people on a list released by the White House.  However, neither Trump nor his relatives were listed, amid speculation he could use the legally dubious tactic of a preemptive pardon to fend off future charges.  Former Trump fund-raiser Elliott Broidy was similarly pardoned, after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws.  The rapper Lil Wayne, who last month pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, and faced 10 years in jail, also made the list.  Tensions have soared on Capitol Hill, where the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.  The spectacle will clash with the opening days of Biden's tenure, as the new president seeks to swiftly confirm his Cabinet picks and push through ambitious legislation -- including a $1.9 trillion rescue package.    - 'I'll get right to work' -    ""We don't have a second to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face as a nation,"" Biden tweeted late Tuesday.  ""That's why after being sworn in tomorrow, I'll get right to work.""  He plans to kick off his tenure by rejoining the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, according to aides, who said Biden would sign 17 orders and actions just hours after being sworn in, setting new paths on immigration, the environment, Covid-19 and the economy.  In first-day moves, he will end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.  To symbolize the new spirit of unity, Biden -- a senator for 36 years -- headed before his inauguration to a church service with the congressional leaders including the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell.  Many overseas leaders breathed a sigh of relief at the end of Trump's hawkish, go-it-alone presidency, with Biden's team pledging greater cooperation with the rest of the world.  Iran's President Hassan Rouhani hailed the departure of ""tyrant"" Trump, saying ""the ball is in America's court"" to return to a landmark nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Tehran.  Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Biden's inauguration would ""be a demonstration of the resilience of American democracy,"" as well as ""the resounding proof that, once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House.""  bur-sct/ec",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The vote is heavy with consequences for Kansans themselves, who will decide whether to remove the right to an abortion from the traditionally conservative state's constitution.  But it is also being seen as a test case for abortion rights nationwide, as Republican-dominated legislatures rush to impose strict bans on the procedure following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Other states including California and Kentucky are set to vote on the issue in November, at the same time as midterm elections to Congress in which both Republicans and Democrats hope to mobilize their supporters nationwide around the question of abortion.  The Kansas ballot centers on a 2019 ruling by the state's supreme court that guarantees access to abortion -- currently up to 22 weeks.   In response, the Republican-dominated state legislature introduced an amendment known as ""Value Them Both"" that would scrap the constitutional right -- with the stated aim of handing regulation of the procedure back to lawmakers.  But in the opposing camp, activists see the campaign as a barely-masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban -- a conservative state legislator having already introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother.   For Ashley All, spokeswoman for pro-abortion rights campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the amendment would deal a blow to ""personal autonomy.""  Activists also complain that the phrasing of the ballot question is counterintuitive, and potentially confusing: voting ""Yes"" to the amendment means abortion rights being curbed, while people who wish to keep those rights intact must vote ""No.""     - All eyes on Kansas -    Abortion rights advocates in Kansas are looking nervously to neighboring Oklahoma and Missouri which are among at least eight states to have passed near-total bans -- the latter making no exceptions for rape or incest -- while Midwestern Indiana adopted its own rigid ban on Saturday.  Kara Miller Karns, a voter in Leawood, Kansas, said she planned to vote for the status quo on Tuesday, saying it was ""not acceptable"" for her daughters to grow up with fewer rights than she did.   But in the same neighborhood, 43-year-old Christine Vasquez said she planned to back the constitutional amendment -- in hope it would clear the way for a future vote on an abortion ban.  ""I believe that life starts at conception,"" she told AFP ahead of the ballot.  The outcome in Kansas could mean a boost or a blow to either side of the highly charged US abortion debate -- and the eyes of the nation will be fixed on the state on Tuesday.  Kansas leans heavily toward the Republican party, which favors stricter abortion regulations, but a 2021 survey from Fort Hays State University found that fewer than 20 percent of Kansas respondents agreed that abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113334565']

The country's top prosecutor did not reveal the reason for the unprecedented search of the home of a former US president, and condemned ""unfounded attacks"" on the FBI and the Justice Department that followed it.  ""I personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant,"" Garland told reporters in his first public statement since Monday's raid. ""The department does not take such a decision lightly.""  While noting that ""ethical obligations"" prevented him detailing the basis of the raid, Garland said he had asked a Florida judge to unseal the warrant because Trump had publicly confirmed the search and there was ""substantial public interest in this matter.""  Trump, who has a copy of the search warrant but has -- so far -- declined to reveal its contents, said late Thursday night he would not oppose the unsealing of the warrant.  ""Not only will I not oppose the release of documents... I am going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents,"" the former president wrote on Truth Social, the social media site he launched this year.  In another post, Trump repeated his claim that the search was an ""unprecedented political weaponization of law enforcement.""  Andrew Weissmann, a former Justice Department official, said Garland had ""called Trump's bluff"" by putting the onus on the former president to object or consent to release of the document.   The Justice Department motion to unseal the warrant noted -- and did not dispute -- statements by Trump's representatives that the FBI was seeking presidential records and potential classified material.  According to US media, the search related to potential mishandling of classified documents taken to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left the White House in January 2021.  The Washington Post on Thursday cited anonymous sources close to the investigation as saying that classified documents relating to nuclear weapons were among the papers sought by the FBI agents during the raid.  The newspaper did not clarify if the nuclear weapons involved belonged to the United States or to another country.    - Political firestorm -    The FBI raid on Trump's palatial Mar-a-Lago residence sparked a political firestorm in an already bitterly divided country, and comes as he is weighing another White House run in 2024.  In a statement on his Truth Social platform on Thursday, Trump said his attorneys had been ""cooperating fully"" and ""the government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it.""  ""And then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided at 6:30 in the morning,"" he said, adding that agents even ""went through the First Lady's closets and rummaged through her clothing and personal items.""  Leading Republicans have rallied around Trump, and some members of his party have harshly denounced the Justice Department and FBI, accusing them of partisanship in targeting the former president.  Garland criticized what he called ""unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department agents and prosecutors.""  An armed man was shot dead by police on Thursday after trying to break into an FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio, police said.    - 'Without fear or favor' -    The Justice Department typically does not confirm or deny whether it is investigating someone, and Garland -- a former prosecutor and judge who has a reputation as a stickler for protocol -- took pains to emphasize the law was being applied fairly.  ""Faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy,"" he said. ""The rule of law means applying the law evenly without fear or favor.""  Since leaving office, Trump has remained the country's most divisive figure and a force in the Republican party, continuing to sow falsehoods that he actually won the 2020 vote.  On Wednesday, the 76-year-old former president was questioned for four hours by Letitia James, the New York state attorney general who is investigating the business practices of the Trump Organization.  Trump is also facing legal scrutiny for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and over the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.  Trump was impeached for a historic second time by the House after the Capitol riot -- he was charged with inciting an insurrection -- but was acquitted by the Senate.  cl/st/to/des/smw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

In a somber televised address, Biden said he gave the final go-ahead for the high-precision strike that successfully targeted Zawahiri in the Afghan capital over the weekend.  ""Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said, adding that he hoped Zawahiri's death would bring ""closure"" to families of the 3,000 people killed in the United States on 9/11.  A senior administration official said Zawahiri was on the balcony of a house in Kabul when he was targeted with two Hellfire missiles, an hour after sunrise on July 31, and that there had been no US boots on the ground in Afghanistan.  ""We are not aware of him ever leaving the safe house. We identified Zawahiri on multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony of where he was ultimately struck,"" the official said.   According to the official's account, the president gave his green light for the strike on July 25 -- as he was recovering in isolation from Covid-19. Biden said there were no civilian casualties in the operation.   The US official called Zawahiri's presence in the Afghan capital Kabul a ""clear violation"" of a deal the Taliban had signed with the US in Doha in 2020 that paved the way for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.  It was the first known over-the-horizon strike by the United States on an Al-Qaeda target in Afghanistan since American forces withdrew from the country on August 31, 2021.   Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run for 20 years since the 9/11 attacks.  He took over Al-Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.  Over the weekend the Afghan interior ministry denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike in Kabul, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in the capital, causing no casualties.  Early Tuesday in Kabul, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out on a residence in the Sherpur area of the city.  ""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first. The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones,"" his tweet said.  The news comes a month before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the control of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces over the preceding two decades.  Under the 2020 Doha deal, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke their ties with Al-Qaeda.  ""What we know is that the senior Haqqani Taliban were aware of his presence in Kabul,"" the Biden official said.   Taliban interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani also heads the feared Haqqani Network, a brutal subset of the Taliban blamed for some of the worst violence of the past 20 years and which has been described by US officials as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence.    - Doctor turned jihadist -    Zawahiri, 71, lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world, but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.  He was believed to be the main strategist -- the real mastermind who steered operations, including the September 11 attacks, as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.  Al-Qaeda is believed to have been degraded in the years since the US invasion of Afghanistan, and the White House official said Zawahiri was ""one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of significance.""  The organization, agreed Soufan Center researcher Colin Clarke, is ""at a crossroads.""  ""Despite Zawahiri's leadership, which minimized AQ's losses while rebuilding, the group still faces serious challenges going forward. For one, there's the question of who will lead al Qaeda after Zawahiri's gone,"" he said.  Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.  He became involved with Egypt's radical Muslim community at a young age and published several books which came for many to symbolize the radical Islamist movement.  He left Egypt in the mid-1980s, heading for Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar where the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based.  It was at that time, when thousands of Islamist fighters flooded into Afghanistan during the 1980s, that Zawahiri and bin Laden met, and in 1998 he became one of five signatories to bin Laden's ""fatwa"" calling for attacks against Americans.  Jihadist monitor SITE said some militants were questioning the veracity of the report he had been killed, while others believed Zawahiri had achieved his desire of ""martyrdom.""   As for Al-Qaeda's future without him, SITE said jihadists were bullish, with one writing: ""If Sheikh Ayman al-Zawahiri is dead, there are a thousand Aymans.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']

Wine told AFP he felt under threat as soldiers surrounded his home on Friday evening following his accusations of fraud to the press.  Museveni, 76, is seeking a sixth term after almost four decades in power, and the former popstar Wine has emerged as his main rival in a youthful country where most have known only one president.  The internet remained down for a third day as vote counting continued from Thursday's poll, with provisional results from 64 percent of polling stations giving Museveni a lead of 62 percent while Wine trailed with 30 percent.  As the results came in, Wine said in an interview at his home that soldiers had jumped the perimeter fence of his compound and beaten his security guard before taking up position around his house.  ""They jumped over my fence. They came inside my compound. They are here right now. I don't know why they're here. But I'm imagining they are here to harm me. I feel threatened,"" said the 38-year-old, who described the invasion as unprecedented and ""a siege"".  He said he confronted the soldiers, who briefly cocked a gun at him and journalists, and refused to respond or leave.  The army's deputy spokesman Deo Akiiki said the soldiers were there to provide security and had stopped three people who tried to ""access the house"".  Provisional results showed Wine's newly formed National Unity Party was on track to become the main opposition in parliament.  - 'We defeated the dictator' -    Earlier Wine had reeled of a list of election regularities during a press conference in his garden, such as ballot box stuffing, and his party's polling agents being beaten and chased away in parts of northern and western Uganda.  ""I am very confident that we defeated the dictator by far. I call upon all Ugandans to reject the blackmail. We have certainly won the election and we've won it by far,"" Wine told journalists.  ""Whatever is being declared is a complete sham, we reject it and we dissociate ourselves with it.""  Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, promised to provide video evidence once the internet was restored.   Election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said he did ""not appreciate the assertion that these results we are reading out are rigged"".  ""The onus is on candidate Kyagulanyi to show how votes are rigged.""  Full results are expected by Saturday afternoon.  Museveni faced a total of 10 candidates, but it is the popularity of the former popstar Wine, who grew up in a slum and is nicknamed the ""ghetto president"", that has rattled the former rebel leader.  The poll followed one of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and scores of deaths.  Police spokesman Fred Enanga said there had been ""no major cases of violence reported"".  A senior foreign diplomat told AFP there had been sporadic incidents of violence and many irregularities, but no sign of mass manipulation.     - Observers denied -    The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  The United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, cancelled a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election, and aside from an African Union mission there was no major international group watching over the vote.  Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the median age is 16, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  But Museveni, one of Africa's longest serving leaders, has never lost an election and observers expect this time around will be no different.  His opponents -- most visibly Wine, who spent much of the campaign in a bulletproof vest and combat helmet -- were arrested, blocked from rallying and dispersed with tear gas throughout the campaign.  Two days of protests in November led to the deaths of 54 people.  np-fb/tgb","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Hadi Matar, 24, was arraigned in court in New York state, with prosecutors outlining how Rushdie had been stabbed approximately 10 times in what they described as a planned, premeditated assault.  After the on-stage attack on Friday, Rushdie had been helicoptered to hospital and underwent emergency surgery.  His agent Andrew Wylie had said the writer was on a ventilator and in danger of losing an eye, but in an update on Saturday he told the New York Times that Rushdie had started to talk again, suggesting his condition had improved.  Author of ""The Satanic Verses"" and ""Midnight's Children"", Rushdie had lived in hiding for years after Iran's first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his killing.   And while Friday's stabbing triggered international outrage, it also drew applause from Islamist hardliners in Iran and Pakistan.  President Joe Biden on Saturday called it a ""vicious"" attack and offered prayers for Rushdie's recovery.  ""Salman Rushdie -- with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced -- stands for essential, universal ideals. Truth. Courage. Resilience,"" Biden said in a statement.  Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon. Police provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.    - Effective death sentence -    The 75-year-old novelist had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran's then-supreme leader Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.  The fatwa followed the publication of the novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" which enraged some Muslims who said it was blasphemous for its portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.  In a recent interview with Germany's Stern magazine, Rushdie spoke of how, after so many years living with death threats, his life was ""getting back to normal.""  ""For whatever it was, eight or nine years, it was quite serious,"" he told a Stern correspondent in New York.  ""But ever since I've been living in America, since the year 2000, really there hasn't been a problem in all that time.""  Rushdie moved to New York in the early 2000s and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  Security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community near Buffalo.  Witnesses said Rushdie was seated on stage and preparing to speak when Matar sprang up from the audience and managed to stab him before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators.  Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.  An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there.   Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.  Matar was ""born and raised in the US,"" the head of the local municipality, Ali Qassem Tahfa, told AFP.    - Outrage -    ""The Satanic Verses"" and its author remain deeply inflammatory in Iran. When asked by AFP on Saturday, nobody in Tehran's main book market dared to openly condemn the stabbing.  ""I was very happy to hear the news,"" said Mehrab Bigdeli, a man in his 50s studying to become a Muslim cleric.  The message was similar in Iran's conservative media, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""  In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan, a party that has staged violent protests, said Rushdie ""deserved to be killed.""  Elsewhere there was shock and outrage.  British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack ""reprehensible"" and ""cowardly.""  Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid condemned the attack, branding it as ""the result of decades of incitement led by the extremist regime in Tehran.""  Messages also flooded in from the literary world, with Rushdie's close friend Ian McEwan calling him an ""inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world.""  Rushdie was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel, ""Midnight's Children,"" in 1981, which won international praise for its portrayal of post-independence India.

Opinion polls show leftist economist Andres Arauz and conservative Guillermo Lasso the clear frontrunners among 16 candidates, with indigenous rights campaigner Yaku Perez in a distant third place.  The vote for president and 137 members of the unicameral congress takes place as Latin America is battling a second, deadly wave of Covid-19 which has aggravated Ecuador's economic troubles.  Campaigning ended Thursday, with both Arauz and Lasso predicting victory for their side.  Arauz, 35, represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while businessman Lasso, 65, is of the CREO rightwing movement.  Arauz is a protege of two-time socialist president Rafael Correa, who remains a strong political force in the country despite a graft conviction that sank his hopes of campaigning to become Arauz's deputy.  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year hiatus under President Lenin Moreno.  He has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.  Running in his third presidential race, free market advocate Lasso has said he would create a million jobs in a year.  He will likely stick to the austerity policies adopted by Moreno, who has had to rein in spending in exchange for International Monetary Fund loans to bolster the oil-producing country's faltering dollar-based economy.    - Second round? -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno as the price of crude crashed.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during the term of Moreno.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, is not seeking reelection.  Given the polling numbers, it is unlikely the first presidential round will be decisive.   To emerge victorious, a candidate must take half of the votes cast, plus one, or at least 40 percent with a 10 percentage point advantage over his nearest rival.  A second round is provisionally scheduled for April 11.  Perez, the first indigenous contender in 15 years, is polling at 12 percent, while the remaining 12 candidates are all at under four percent, including the only woman on the list -- Ximena Pena.  Election officials decided not to cancel the vote despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed some 15,000 people in Ecuador.  Polls suggest many voters may stay away for fear of infection.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76763779', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84078919']"

Huddled up on a folding chair, with arms crossed, wearing huge knitted mittens and a green coat to ward off the wintery conditions, Sanders watched his former rival become president.  Sanders, who arrived carrying a large brown envelope, was compared to a grandfather stopping in at the inauguration on the way to the post office, or perhaps he was off to pick up a doctor's prescription.  His wife Jane O'Meara Sanders embraced the look -- tweeting ""Vermont jacket, Vermont gloves, Vermont common sense!""  Vogue declared that ""nothing looks as good on him as his signature anti-fashion style.""    - Lady Gaga's skirt -    Once all the guests were seated and well wrapped up, Lady Gaga was escorted down the stairs wearing a ball gown with a billowing red skirt to sing the national anthem.  The pop star's fashion statement -- designed by Schiaparelli -- was quickly hailed as the perfect outfit... to ensure social distancing.    - Super-sized Bible -    For his swearing in, Joe Biden put his left hand on his family Bible, an extra-large version which fascinated internet users.  Some wondered if it was printed in a big font to help Biden, aged 78, read it.  CNN said the five-inch (13 centimeter) thick Bible has been in the Biden family since 1893, with the new president also using it at his swearing-in ceremonies as vice president in 2009 and 2013.    - A cowboy at the podium -    After the inauguration, country music star Garth Brooks -- wearing blue jeans and a shiny belt buckle -- sung a solemn rendition of ""Amazing Grace.""

With Spain still grappling with a third wave of coronavirus infections, the vote in the wealthy northeastern region was held under tight restrictions to reduce the risk of contagion.  The Socialists which govern at the national level won the biggest share of the vote, 24.5 percent, according to a poll released by public television TVE after polling stations closed at 8 pm (1900 GMT) and carried out over the past two weeks.  But in terms of the number of seats in Catalonia's 135-seat parliament, the party came in second behind the leftist separatist ERC.  The ERC and  two other separatist parties -- the more hardline JxC, or ""Together for Catalonia"", and the smaller, radical CUP -- would once again have an absolute majority in the assembly.  While separatist parties have been deeply divided over strategy since Catalonia's failed 2017 separatist bid, the poll suggests they are well placed to continue to govern the region of around 7.8 million people.  Officials results are expected around midnight.  Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had hoped the election -- the fifth in the region in a decade  -- would end the separatists' rule in Catalonia.  He fielded former health minister Salvador Illa, the face of Spain's fight against the pandemic, as his candidate in the elections and made several campaign appearances in Catalonia.  While the ERC has helped Sanchez's minority government to pass legislation at the national level, like other separatist parties it vowed in writing not to reach any agreements with Illa.    - Virus measures -    Voters had to wear face masks, use disinfectant gel provided at polling stations and stand apart while lining up in rainy weather to cast their ballots.  To help spread out voters, polling stations were set up in spacious venues such as food markets, the area around FC Barcelona's football stadium and the bullring in Tarragona.  The final hour of voting was reserved for people infected with Covid-19 or undergoing quarantine.   During this time polling staff will wear gloves, facial screens and protective gowns.  The measures appeared to discourage people from voting.  While some 5.5 million people are eligible to vote, as of 6 pm turnout stood at 45.7 percent, compared with 68.2 percent at the same time during the previous election in December 2017, just months after the failed secession bid.  ""I hesitated until the last minute whether to come vote or not,"" Cristina Caballero, a 34-year-old child educator, told AFP at a Barcelona polling station.  ""I think these elections should have been postponed.""  The regional government tried to put off the elections until the end of May because of the pandemic but the courts blocked that move.    - 'We are afraid' -    While more than 40 percent of the 82,000 people assigned to help staff polling stations on the day had asked to be recused, all polling stations were operating normally as of noon, according to the Catalan government.  Still, some people tapped for polling station duty expressed concern.  ""Of course we are afraid, I just had cancer and am still on sick leave, but I was called up,"" Eva Vizcaino, a 54-year-old office worker, told AFP at a Barcelona polling station.  ""The last hour is especially frightening, when people with Covid come.""  In the December 2017 election, JxC was ahead, forming a coalition with ERC.  If it is confirmed that the tables have been turned in ERC's favour, it could facilitate the tentative reconciliation that Sanchez's government has sought to broker since coming to power.   ""An ERC executive would maintain the current ambiguous approach of criticising Madrid rhetorically but not adopting any unilateral measures,"" said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at political consultancy Teneo.  ""In contrast, a government headed by JxC would probably lead to a more confrontational stance.""  dbh/ds/mg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48838589']

Shiites in Afghanistan are currently commemorating the first 10 days of the Islamic holy month of Muharram, culminating in Ashura on Monday, when worshippers gather at mosques and take part in processions.  The explosives were attached to a handcart loaded with vegetables and parked in an area where residents shopped for daily food items, Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran told reporters.  ""The explosion took place amongst civilians, and according to preliminary information two of our citizens were martyred and three others were wounded,"" he said.

The blast came just days ahead of Ashura, which marks the death of the revered Shiite Imam Hussein Ibn Ali, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.  No group has so far claimed the blast, but the Sunni jihadist Islamic State has regularly targeted Shiites in Afghanistan in the past.  The number of violent public attacks across the country has fallen since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but IS has continued to target Shiites, whom it views as heretics.

The rebel push by a group of 12 senators loyal to President Donald Trump to block formal certification of Biden's November victory is all but certain to fail, but has raised tensions on Capitol Hill as lawmakers returned to work.   Wednesday's joint session -- paired with a collection of rallies fueled by Trump's refusal to accept defeat -- is certain to be the high point of a fraught week showcasing the deep political divisions roiling the country.  On Sunday, lawmakers in the House of Representatives will vote for their leader, and top Democrat Nancy Pelosi faces a possibly tricky battle for reelection as speaker -- an office that places her third in the line of succession for the presidency.  Pelosi's Democratic Party holds a slim majority in the 435-seat chamber -- temporarily at 434 after a member-elect died of Covid -- and she is facing no open challenge, but she will need her caucus to remain firm.  Then on Monday, Trump stages one of his big, boisterous rallies in Georgia to campaign for two Republican candidates in a fiercely fought pair of runoff elections that will determine the balance of power in the Senate.  The special elections take place Tuesday, with Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler facing Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.   ""Georgia voters have so much power right now,"" Ossoff told a campaign event in the small town of Eatonton on Saturday. ""You have the power to make this happen.""  Victory by Ossoff and Warnock would give Democrats, and Biden, a major boost -- Senate seats would be evenly divided between the parties at 50 each, but incoming Vice President Kamala Harris would wield a tie-breaking vote. Democrats already control the House.  ""This is going to be a very tough battle but it is absolutely within the realm of possibility -- in fact, the realm of likelihood -- the Democrats can win,"" Stacey Abrams, the charismatic former Georgia lawmaker who has emerged as a party leader, told CNN on Sunday.    - Threat of chaos -    Wednesday's vote to certify the November election results, which Biden won handily with 306 Electoral College votes to 232 for Trump, would usually be a dry, pro-forma exercise.  But Trump has infused it with unprecedented drama as he continues to insist, without foundation, that the election was stolen from him, and as scores of Republican lawmakers back his efforts.  ""An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can't let it happen!"" he tweeted. He has urged thousands of his supporters to come to Washington on Wednesday for protests. Similar past events have led to sporadic violence.  Beyond the 12 senators, more than 100 Trump loyalists in the House have vowed to join the last-ditch challenge, thereby forcing both houses of Congress to debate the objections raised before confirming Biden's victory.   With Democrats controlling the House and many Republicans expected to vote to certify Biden's election, the bid seems certain to fail.  The maneuver nevertheless places Vice President Mike Pence in an awkward position: as presiding officer of the Senate, he must tally each state's votes and announce the result -- his boss's loss.   The attention-getting initiative has divided Republicans.  Senator Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 presidential candidate, on Saturday dismissed it as ""nonsense,"" saying: ""The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic.""  Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has urged members to respect the Electoral College result.    - Pelosi and the Covid factor -    At noon Sunday, a maskless Pence gaveled in the new Congress before donning a mask to swear in the three dozen senators who were elected or re-elected to the 100-member chamber in November.  He congratulated each of them -- including newly elected Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former college football coach, and Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly, a retired space shuttle commander -- with an elbow bump.  In the House, Pelosi has expressed confidence she has the support for reelection in a vote later Sunday, but the coronavirus pandemic has become a wild card.   A handful of lawmakers have been quarantining, and in-person voting is being required.   One newly elected Republican, 41-year-old Luke Letlow of Louisiana, died recently of Covid-19.  Pelosi, the first woman in US history to serve as House speaker, has signaled that this will be her final turn as speaker.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

Although presidential frontrunners William Ruto and Raila Odinga have both vowed to maintain calm following Tuesday's poll, the memory of past election-related violence remains fresh for many Kenyans, who have urged political parties to accept the results.  With pressure building on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), which has to declare the results by August 16, officials worked overnight to count votes and dispel rigging fears.  ""We call for patience among Kenyans as we undertake this rigorous exercise and also endeavour to complete this exercise as soon as possible,"" IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said in a late-night briefing.  Kenyans, some of whom lined up before dawn to cast their ballot, voted in six elections on Tuesday, choosing a new president as well as senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  Despite the early show of enthusiasm however, turnout in some areas appeared to be weak, suggesting that for some Kenyans at least, patience with years of unfulfilled promises was running out.  Even those who showed up early to vote said they were tired of electing political leaders who had done little to improve their lives.  ""All along we have been doing elections, getting promises but we see no change,"" said George Otieno Henry, a 56-year-old artisan.  ""I hope this time it will be better,"" he told AFP in Kibera, one of Nairobi's largest slums.  By 4:00 pm (1300 GMT), 10 hours after polling began, turnout was at just over 56 percent of the 22 million registered voters, according to the IEBC.  Comparable figures for the August 2017 election were not immediately available but overall turnout reached 78 percent in that vote.    - Cost-of-living crisis -    Deputy President Ruto and Odinga, a veteran opposition leader now backed by the ruling party, have both pledged to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and ease the lives of ordinary Kenyans.  But many are bracing for the pair to spar over the results, reflecting earlier polls in the East African nation where no presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002.  Once the heir-apparent, Ruto, 55, found himself banished to the sidelines after two-term President Uhuru Kenyatta -- who cannot run for a third time -- joined hands with his former foe Odinga, 77, in a move that stunned the country.  Since then, the wealthy businessman has cast himself as the champion of ""hustlers"" trying to eke out a living in a country ruled by ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  With a third of Kenya's population living in poverty, economic pressures weighed on voters even before the war in Ukraine sent the prices of essential goods soaring.  Prior to the election, some observers surmised that the economy could surpass tribal affiliations as a key factor driving voter behaviour, while others said politicians' failure to tackle the crisis could keep people away from the ballot all together.  ""Many Kenyans... have cited their lack of faith in politicians to improve their current economic circumstances as the main reason for not participating in the August polls,"" Oxford Economics said in a note last week.    - 'Calm and peaceful' -    Analysts have suggested that Odinga, a onetime political prisoner and former prime minister who is making his fifth stab at the presidency, could edge past his younger rival.  If neither wins more than 50 percent, Kenya will stage a run-off for the first time in its history.  Kenya's international partners are closely watching the election in a country deemed a beacon of regional stability.  Local polls were suspended in several areas on Tuesday, triggering a protest in one case, but police said the electoral process had largely ""remained calm and peaceful with no major incidents to report"".  Security was tight, with a view to preventing a repeat of the post-election violence that has hit Kenya in the past.  The 2007 poll was followed by politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, while Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result was met with a heavy-handed police response that left dozens dead.  bur-amu/gw","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

Some Kenyans said they just wanted the election cycle to end so they could focus on putting food on the table in a country hit by skyrocketing inflation and an unemployment crisis.   ""The election was done yesterday, I am not interested in wasting more time on it,"" Celestine Muoki, a 28-year-old IT specialist, told AFP.  ""Let us move on,"" she said, echoing the exhaustion felt by many in Kenya.    - 'Lack of faith in politicians' -    But few Kenyans expect either Ruto or Odinga to accept the result without a fight, reflecting earlier polls in the East African nation where no presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002.  Once the heir-apparent, Ruto, 55, found himself banished to the sidelines after two-term President Uhuru Kenyatta -- who cannot run a third time -- joined hands with his former foe Odinga, 77, in a move that stunned the country.  Since then, the wealthy businessman has cast himself as the champion of ""hustlers"" trying to survive in a country ruled by ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  With a third of Kenya's population living in poverty, economic pressures weighed on voters even before the war in Ukraine sent the prices of essential goods soaring.  Prior to the election, some observers surmised that the economy could surpass tribal affiliations as a key factor driving voter behaviour, while others said politicians' failure to tackle the crisis could keep people away from the ballot all together.  ""Many Kenyans... have cited their lack of faith in politicians to improve their current economic circumstances as the main reason for not participating in the August polls,"" Oxford Economics said in a note last week.    - 'Calm and peaceful' -    If neither Ruto nor Odinga wins more than 50 percent of the vote, Kenya will stage a run-off for the first time in its history.  Kenya's international partners are closely watching the election in a country deemed a beacon of regional stability.  Local polls were suspended in several areas on Tuesday, triggering a protest in one case, but police said the electoral process had largely ""remained calm and peaceful with no major incidents to report"".  Security is tight nationwide, with a view to preventing a repeat of the post-election violence that has hit Kenya in the past, and schools have been ordered to remain closed until Monday.  The 2007 poll was followed by politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, while Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result was met with a heavy-handed police response that left dozens dead.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

At least 45 people died after the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Friday, triggering panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  Search-and-rescue worked through the night as they pulled dozens of bodies from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of about 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province, where a hospital was flattened and a shopping mall was left in ruins.  Others were killed south of the city after the quake struck, as a strong aftershock jolted the disaster-hit region Saturday morning.  Planes and boats packed with food and other emergency supplies were arriving as thousands left homeless by the quake flocked to makeshift shelters, many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents.  ""We need more equipment for the rescue effort,"" said Ali Rahman, chief of the local disaster agency.  ""Now, we're focusing on two locations"" in the hunt for survivors, he added.  Authorities have not given a figure for the number of residents who could still be trapped under crushed buildings, including the hospital that collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff inside.  On Saturday, authorities said they had pulled eight corpses from under the building, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.  Among the Mamuju survivors was a pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris. The pair are now being treated in hospital.  Nearly 200 people were hospitalised for serious injuries, local authorities said.    - 'Heartfelt solidarity' -    The Pope said he was ""saddened"" to learn of the quake.  ""His Holiness Pope Francis expresses his heartfelt solidarity with all those affected by this natural disaster,"" the Vatican said in a statement.  ""He prays for the repose of the deceased, the healing of the injured and the consolation of all who grieve.""  On Friday, residents tried to flee Mamuju in cars and motorbikes as they drove past corrugated metal roofs and other building debris scattered on the roadside.   But landslides triggered by heavy rains and the quake blocked the main access road out of the seaside city.  The meteorological agency warned residents about strong aftershocks and to avoid the beachfront in case they sparked a tsunami.  The city's airport had also been damaged, while the regional governor's office was also partly destroyed, authorities said.  Power remained out in parts of Mamuju after the quake damaged its electricity grid.  The Indonesian Red Cross said it was rushing medical and relief supplies to the scene, with its teams working to help find trapped residents.  Save the Children warned that the young were among the most at risk.  ""While the extent of the earthquake damage is still unclear, we know children are often the most vulnerable following disaster,"" it said.  ""It will be essential that children are prioritised in any response, as they may have witnessed the death of loved ones or become separated from their parents.""  The quake's epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and it had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres.  Indonesia, a sprawling Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.   In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.  bur-pb/je",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

More than 170 people were still missing, two days after a wall of water and debris hurtled down a valley in the northern state of Uttarakhand, destroying bridges and roads, hitting two hydroelectric power plants and killing dozens.  The disaster has been blamed on rapidly melting glaciers in the Himalayan region caused by global warming. Building activity for dams and dredging riverbeds for sand -- for use in the construction industry -- are other suggested factors.  Most of those missing were workers at the two power plants, with some trapped in a 2.7-kilometre (1.7-mile) U-shaped tunnel in Tapovan that filled with mud and rocks when the 20-metre-high (70-foot) flood hit.  Twelve people were rescued from one side of the tunnel on Sunday but another 34 were still trapped at the other end, police official Banudutt Nair, in charge of the rescue operation, told AFP.  Hundreds of workers toiled all night and by morning had cleared their way 120 metres into the tunnel, with rescue personnel ""waiting to enter as soon as any movement deep inside the tunnel is possible"", the local government tweeted.  ""Work will happen day and night. There will be no break,"" said local roads official AS Rathod.  Nair said rescuers were not giving up hope, believing that there were air pockets inside the tunnel, where the workers could still be alive.  Giant floodlights lit up one entrance late Monday as a huge excavator slowly worked its way through the sludge, carrying out huge piles, which rescuers then sifted through looking for survivors, or remains.  Nearby, workers used an excavator to try to remove giant boulders from the road blocking the way to the second power plant, the Rishi Ganga facility.  This was destroyed and was a wasteland covered with brown and grey slush, with a nearby concrete bridge swept away. At least 35 workers and locals were missing.    - 'Don't let go' -    One of those who made it out of the tunnel was Rajesh Kumar, 28, who together with others clung to scaffolding rods in the tunnel for four hours before the water level fell and they were able to escape.  ""Suddenly there was a sound of whistling... there was shouting, people were telling us to come out. We thought it was a fire. We started running but the water gushed in. It was like a Hollywood movie,"" Kumar told AFP.  ""We just kept telling each other -- come what may, we must not let go of the rods,"" he said from his hospital bed.  Shopkeeper Ramesh Negi was enjoying the Sunday morning sun when he heard a loud roar and saw a huge wall of water smash into and sweep away a bridge.  Dozens of workers building a concrete dam on the river bed and grazers leading their cattle along the mountain slopes disappeared beneath the sudden deluge, he recalled.  ""There was dust and screams all over,"" the 36-year-old told AFP.  ""We tried to alert the grazers but they were blown away by the wind pressure before being consumed by the water and slush. We can only guess what happened.""  Mangra, another tunnel survivor, remembered hearing a loud, rumbling sound and the screams of other colleagues: ""Run, run, run!""   The 28-year-old scrambled out of the tunnel but six of his friends and neighbours from his village remain trapped.  ""It felt like the mountain was crashing and the Earth was moving,"" Mangra told AFP outside the tunnel, cuts and scrapes on his hands and legs.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105358710']

Hollywood's acting union nominated Boseman for his lead role as an ambitious young horn player in 1920s blues drama ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" and his supporting role as a Vietnam War soldier in Spike Lee's ""Da 5 Bloods.""  Both films also scored nominations for best cast -- the top prize at the SAG ceremony, which like much of the Tinseltown awards calendar has been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.  Although less high-profile than the Golden Globes nominations a day earlier, the SAG awards are seen as a stronger indicator of Oscars glory, since actors represent the largest branch of the roughly 10,000 Oscar voters in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.   Only two actors have ever posthumously won Oscars -- Peter Finch for 1976's ""Network,"" and Heath Ledger for 2008's ""The Dark Knight.""  Boseman died at age 43 in August last year from colon cancer, a diagnosis he never publicly discussed.  Boseman's co-star Viola Davis also earned a lead actress nod for ""Ma Rainey,"" putting it in a tie atop the SAG film acting nominations with Korean-American drama ""Minari.""  ""Minari,"" which follows an immigrant family who move to 1980s rural Arkansas to scrape together a new life, is hoping to emulate ""Parasite"" -- which won last year's SAG best cast prize before ultimately being named the Oscars best picture.  Former ""Walking Dead"" favorite Steven Yeun and veteran South Korean star Youn Yuh-jung were both recognized for the film, along with the ensemble cast.  Rounding out the prestigious best cast category were a pair of 1960s-set civil rights movies: ""One Night in Miami"" and courtroom drama ""The Trial of the Chicago 7.""  Netflix again dominated the film nominations with 13, while rival streamer Amazon followed with four.    - Trump row -    Former US president Donald Trump threatened to overshadow the morning's announcement with an angry letter resigning from the Hollywood union, which had recently launched disciplinary action against him.  In the letter published on Thursday, the former star of reality TV show ""The Apprentice"" dismissed SAG's threat to expel him with the words: ""Who cares!""  ""I no longer wish to be associated with your union... You have done nothing for me,"" wrote Trump, whose screen credits include ""Home Alone 2"" and ""Zoolander.""  SAG-AFTRA offered a succinct reply: ""Thank you.""  The union had voted last month to find ""probable cause of a violation"" by Trump in connection with the January 6 mob attack on the US Capitol.  It instructed a committee to investigate those events and Trump's mistreatment of broadcast journalists -- whom the 160,000-member union also represents.  Also among the ranks of SAG members are Hollywood's stunt workers, who receive their only major awards recognition at the annual SAG ceremony.  ""Da 5 Bloods"" and ""Chicago 7"" landed stunt nominations Thursday, alongside Disney's ""Mulan,"" Tom Hanks-starring western ""News of the World,"" and superhero movie ""Wonder Woman 1984.""  On the television side, ""The Crown"" and ""Schitt's Creek"" followed a strong showing at the Globes by topping the SAG nominations with five apiece.  The SAGs nominated several TV shows overlooked by the Globes, including Netflix mega-hit ""Bridgerton"" and acclaimed British drama ""I May Destroy You.""  The nominations were announced on Instagram Live by Daveed Diggs -- who earned a television acting nod for the Disney+ version of Broadway hit ""Hamilton"" -- and Lily Collins (""Emily in Paris"").   The 27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards were twice postponed, first by the pandemic and later by a clash with music's Grammys.

Biden, who has suffered deep personal tragedy and is known for his public displays of emotion, has stressed the need to unite the country after President Donald Trump's chaotic four years in office.  ""It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" Biden said in somber remarks at the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial.  The US on Tuesday recorded another 2,482 deaths due to the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally.   Inauguration eve is normally a time of massive crowds gathering in the capital, but Biden, joined by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, were almost alone on the empty National Mall due to Covid restrictions and heightened security after the deadly riot at the US Capitol.  On the Mall's grassy expanse, some 200,000 flags have been planted to represent the absent crowds at the inauguration ceremony on Wednesday.  Trump, who has not appeared in public for a week, broke days of silence with a pre-recorded farewell video address.  For the first time he asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming administration -- a change from months spent persuading his Republican followers that the Democrats cheated their way to election victory.    - Trump snub -    Trump, whose efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and console its victims have been widely criticized, will snub Biden by not attending the inauguration.  He has also yet to personally congratulate Biden on his win or invite him for the customary cup of tea in the Oval Office.  In one of his last acts before he flies to Florida on Wednesday morning, Trump is expected to issue scores of pardons, with speculation rife over who might make the list.  The latest indications are that Trump will not take the legally dubious step of issuing himself and his children preemptive pardons.  Outside the White House fence, central Washington has taken on a dystopian look ahead of Biden's inauguration, swarming with National Guard troops and largely emptied of ordinary people.  Fears of right-wing attacks in the wake of the pro-Trump riot in the Capitol building on January 6 have triggered unprecedented deployment of armed personnel, concrete barriers and secure areas dubbed ""green"" and ""red"" zones.  Adding to the tension, the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.    - Biden comes to town -    Earlier on Tuesday, tears rolled down Biden's cheeks at a farewell ceremony in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where he paid tribute to his late son Beau, a rising politician who died of brain cancer in 2015 aged 46.  ""I only have one regret, that he's not here,"" Biden said.  Biden, a veteran Democratic senator who also served as vice president to Barack Obama, is staying overnight with his wife Jill in Blair House, a residence for heads of state and other important visitors across the street from the White House.  His inaugural speech will last between 20-30 minutes, according to a source familiar with preparations, and ""he will reach out to all Americans, and call on every citizen to be part of meeting the extraordinary challenges facing all of us.""  To symbolize the new spirit, Biden has invited the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell -- and other congressional leaders to attend a church service with him on Wednesday before the inauguration.  A person familiar with McConnell's plans confirmed to AFP the Republican congressional leader would join Biden, a longtime Senate colleague, in church.    - Pardons -    According to CNN and other US outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he may grant clemency to.  After what The New York Times reports has been an intense lobbying effort, these are expected to be a mix of white-collar criminals and people whose cases have been championed by criminal justice activists.  More controversial possible pardons that have been the subject of speculation for months would be for the likes of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Trump's influential advisor Steve Bannon.  But Trump has, according to latest US media reports, moved away from the temptation to issue himself a preemptive pardon. This would anger his Republican backers in the Senate right ahead of the start of the impeachment trial.  Although Trump was easily acquitted thanks to party support in his first impeachment last year, this time it may not go as well.  Senior Senate Republican McConnell said in blistering comments Tuesday that Trump had ""provoked"" his supporters and that the ""mob was fed lies"" before embarking on the assault against Congress.  sms-mlm/bgs/jm   THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

More than 3,500 demonstrators were detained in protests across the country on Saturday, with several injured in clashes with police in Moscow, following Navalny's call to rally against President Vladimir Putin's 20-year rule.  The West has widely condemned the ""harsh tactics"" used against demonstrators, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian saying Sunday the mass arrest of protesters was ""an intolerable affront"" and a ""slide towards authoritarianism"".  Polish President Andrzej Duda has called for the European Union to step up sanctions against Russia over the treatment of Navalny, the Financial Times reported Sunday.  ""The only way to (avoid conflict) is to force international law to be observed. The only way to do this without rifles, cannons and bombs is via sanctions,"" Duda told the FT.  The Polish leader also said EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell should re-consider plans to visit Russia next month unless Navalny is released.  EU foreign ministers are due to consider their response to Navalny's detention on Monday, with Borrell saying the ""next steps"" will be discussed.  Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday accused the US embassy of interfering in Russia's domestic affairs after the mission distributed a ""demonstration alert"" to US citizens in Russia recommending they avoid protests.  ""Of course, these publications are inappropriate,"" Peskov told a state TV channel. ""And of course indirectly, they are absolutely an interference in our domestic affairs.""  A US mission spokeswoman said US embassies and consulates around the world routinely issue safety messages to US citizens.  ""This is a common, routine practice of many countries' diplomatic missions,"" she told AFP on Sunday.  The US embassy in Moscow on Saturday said that Washington supported ""the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression"".    - Protests in over 100 cities -    Peskov also accused protest organisers of seeking to ""rock the boat"" and said the number of people who had demonstrated paled in comparison to Putin supporters.  ""A lot of people vote for Putin,"" Peskov said, pointing to last year's constitutional plebiscite that allowed 68-year-old Putin to remain in power until 2036.  Navalny, Putin's most prominent critic, was arrested on returning to Moscow last weekend following months of treatment in Germany for a near-fatal poisoning with a Soviet-designed Novichok nerve agent.  He then called for Saturday's unauthorised protests, which took on an unprecedented geographic scale, spanning more than 100 cities.   Around 20,000 people protested in Moscow and more than 10,000 in Saint Petersburg, according to estimates from AFP journalists, with rallies also held in numerous countries including France and Lithuania.  Leonid Volkov, the head of Navalny's regional network, praised the turnout.  ""I am certainly proud, very impressed and inspired,"" Volkov told AFP. Navalny's team is hoping to stage another rally next weekend.  Many at the protests said they were angered by the findings of a Navalny investigation into an opulent Black Sea property allegedly owned by Putin.   Peskov said the luxury mansion on the Black Sea was ""private"" property and had nothing to do with Putin.    - Protester in intensive care -    Moscow officials said that 29 people received medical assistance in hospitals and were released.   Saint Petersburg prosecutors said they were probing violations on ""the part of law enforcement"" and the use of force against a woman.  The statement was released after local media published a video showing a middle-aged woman falling to the ground after being kicked by riot police.  In the video, a woman -- identified as Margarita Yudina -- is seen asking three policemen in full riot gear why they were detaining a young unarmed protester. One of the policeman then kicks her in the stomach.  The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it had launched criminal inquiries in Moscow over the use of violence against law enforcement, hooliganism and property damage.  The OVD Info monitor said police seized at least 3,521 protesters, with 1,398 people detained in Moscow and 526 in Saint Petersburg.  The head of the Kremlin's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, said most of those detained in Moscow had been released.  He also defended the detentions, saying the protests were illegal and took place during a coronavirus pandemic. ""I see no violations whatsoever,"" he said.   Navalny, who rose to prominence a decade ago, accuses the FSB security agency of seeking to poison him on Putin's orders.   He is the target of several criminal probes and supporters fear authorities are planning to sentence him to a long prison term.  mak-as/dl/pvh/har   GOOGLE","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105008734', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105137806']"

The British author, who spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders ordered his killing, underwent emergency surgery and was placed on a ventilator after Friday's assault in which a 24-year-old man, Hadi Matar, rushed the stage where Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture and stabbed him in the neck and abdomen.  According to his agent Andrew Wylie, the nerves in one of Rushdie's arms were severed and his liver damaged in the attack, and he ""will likely lose one eye.""  Rushdie, 75, had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran's then supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.  The fatwa followed publication of the novel ""The Satanic Verses"" which sparked fury among some Muslims who believed it was blasphemous.  - Assailant raised in US -    Rushdie moved to New York in the early 2000s and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  And security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community in western New York state.  According to witnesses, Rushdie was seated on an auditorium stage and preparing to speak when Matar jumped up from the audience and managed to stab him several times before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators. Matar was finally cuffed and taken into police custody.  A doctor in the audience provided emergency first aid on the spot before Rushdie was airlifted by helicopter to the hospital in nearby Erie.  State police said Matar, from Fairfax, New Jersey, had been formally charged with attempted murder, but otherwise provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.  His family apparently came from a border village called Yaroun in southern Lebanon. An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there. Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.  Matar was ""born and raised in the US,"" the head of the local municipality, Ali Qassem Tahfa, told AFP.  While Khomeini's original fatwa has ceased to be a part of daily discourse in Iran for some time, the clerical leadership under his successor Ayatollah Ali Khamenei did nothing to indicate it no longer stood and, on occasion, underlined the decree was still valid.  Conservative media in Iran hailed Friday's attack, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""  In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan -- a party that has staged violent protests against what it deems to be anti-Muslim blasphemy -- said Rushdie ""deserved to be killed.""  Elsewhere there was widespread shock and outrage, along with expressions of support and solidarity for the writer.  British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" while in Washington, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called it a ""reprehensible"" attack.  Rushdie was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  - Wrote memoir in hiding -    But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" transformed his life when the resulting fatwa forced him into nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell even his children where he lived.  Even as the need for constant security began to diminish in the late 1990s, threats and boycotts continued against literary events that Rushdie attended. His knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  Since moving to New York Rushdie has been an outspoken advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The fatwa and other threats failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  bur/dw       THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

The search warrant and related materials, unsealed by a Florida judge, showed agents carted away a significant number of items from the raid, which ignited a political firestorm in an already bitterly divided country.  The warrant, which was personally approved by Attorney General Merrick Garland, authorized the FBI to search the ""45 office"" -- a reference to the 45th US president's private office at his Mar-a-Lago residence -- and storage rooms.  It directed them to seize documents and records ""illegally possessed"" in violation of three criminal statutes, including one falling under the Espionage Act, which makes it a crime to illegally obtain or retain national security information.  Trump, who is weighing another White House run in 2024, vehemently denounced the FBI raid on his Florida home and claimed that all of the material confiscated during the search had been previously ""declassified.""  ""They didn't need to 'seize' anything,"" he said in a statement on his Truth Social platform. ""They could have had it anytime they wanted without playing politics and breaking into Mar-a-Lago.""  Legal experts cautioned that while the warrant cites the Espionage Act, any potential charges remain unclear and Trump is not necessarily suspected of espionage.  ""The Espionage Act encompasses a ton of crimes that have nothing to do with 'spying,'"" Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer, said on Twitter. ""It's about unlawful storing of information relating to the national defense.""  Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, agreed, saying the ""Espionage Act is a pretty broad law about mishandling classified documents, not just espionage.""  Among the records seized during the raid were documents marked ""Top Secret,"" ""Secret"" and ""Confidential.""  Some of the papers were marked ""SCI"" -- sensitive compartmented information -- meaning they were meant to be viewed only in secure government facilities.    - 'Radical left Democrats' -    FBI agents also seized binders of photos, a handwritten note, information about the ""President of France,"" and the grant of clemency made by Trump to Roger Stone, an ally of the former president, according to the list.  The Justice Department had asked a federal judge to unseal the search warrant on Friday barring objections from Trump.  The 76-year-old Trump did not block the release, but complained that he was the victim of ""unprecedented political weaponization of law enforcement"" by ""radical left Democrats.""  Leading Republicans have rallied around Trump and some members of his party have accused the Justice Department and FBI of partisanship in targeting the ex-president.  In an attack that appeared to be a direct response to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, an armed man tried to storm an FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio on Thursday.  The assailant, who was shot dead by police after an hours-long standoff, reportedly posted on Truth Social that he hoped his actions would serve as a ""call to arms.""  Garland on Thursday criticized what he called ""unfounded attacks"" on the FBI and the Justice Department while FBI Director Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee, denounced ""violence and threats against law enforcement.""  The Justice Department typically does not confirm or deny whether it is investigating someone, and Garland took pains to emphasize that the law was being applied fairly to Trump.  In addition to investigations into his business practices, Trump faces legal scrutiny for his efforts to overturn the results of the November 2020 election, and for the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.  Trump was impeached for a historic second time by the House after the Capitol riot -- he was charged with inciting an insurrection -- but was acquitted by the Senate.  cl/md",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

A struggling economy, the high cost of living, soaring poverty compounded by the Covid pandemic, drought in southern parts of the country and the death of a former strongman president all loom large.  The ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party, which has held power for more than 40 years, is facing the most serious challenge since the country's first multiparty vote in 1992.  Eight political parties are running, but the real contest lies between the MPLA and its long-standing rival and ex-rebel movement the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  Opinion polls suggest that support for the MPLA -- which won 61 percent of the vote in 2017 elections  -- will dwindle, while the UNITA, which has entered an electoral pact with two other parties, will make gains.   But UNITA's inroads might not be enough to unseat Lourenco, who is expected to secure a second mandate.   Still, it is unlikely to be a smooth swing back into office for the 68-year-old, who succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago.  ""The margins will be closer than ever before... but the advantages of incumbency mean MPLA is still odds on to pip Costa (Junior),"" said Eric Humphery-Smith, an analyst at London-based Verisk Maplecroft.    - 'An alternative' -    The MPLA has maintained its grip on the electoral process and public media in Angola, but the opposition tells its supporters not to be intimidated.  ""Don't be afraid of an alternative,"" Costa Junior told supporters at his final rally in the capital Luanda on Monday. ""There is no democracy with a single party in power.""  The 60-year-old Costa Junior who is popular among the youth  -- a significant and growing voting bloc -- pledges to ""eradicate poverty"" and create jobs.  His rival, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised to usher in a new era for Angola when he was first elected, has trumpeted a list of achievements to woo voters.  ""We made and restructured our economy,"" he told one of his final rallies in the capital at the weekend.   But little has changed for most of Angola's 33 million people for whom life is a daily grind in Africa's second largest crude oil producer.  ""We've been voting for years and it doesn't work,"" said a 37-year-old street hawker Gabriel.  ""Everything is very expensive, prices are going up and we are earning crumbs.""  The petro-dollars benefited the former president, the late dos Santos who died in Spain last month, his family and cronies.  The night-time and low-key repatriation of dos Santos's remains to Angola in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre element to the election.  Analysts warn that ruling party attempts to capitalise on dos Santos's funeral could backfire as opinions on his legacy are not ""unanimous"", especially among young people.  Some 14.7 million people are registered to vote at 13,200 polling stations across the vast southern African nation.  Angolans living overseas are for the first time able to cast ballots from abroad.  Polling stations open at 7:00 am (0600 GMT) and close 11 hours later.  Results are expected within a few days. In past elections, results have been contested in a process than can take several weeks.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

The Czech presidency ""will convene an urgent meeting of energy ministers to discuss specific emergency measures to address the energy situation,"" Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on Twitter.  Approved by European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen, the move comes as the 27-nation bloc is trying to shed dependence on supplies of Russian oil and gas following the Ukraine invasion that began on February 24.  Reduced supplies and anxiety over the future have sparked rocket growth in energy prices across Europe.  Czech Industry and Trade Minister Jozef Sikela said the EU Energy Council should meet ""at the earliest possible date"".  ""We are in an energy war with Russia and it is damaging the whole EU,"" he said on Twitter.  On Friday, Germany and France reported record electricity prices for 2023 as the year-ahead contracts jumped to 850 euros ($850) per megawatt hour in Germany and to more than 1,000 euros in France from 85 euros in both countries last year.  The European Commission is planning to cut EU dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies of the fuel before 2030.    - 'Pan-European problem' -    Heavily dependent on gas imports from Russia, the Czech Republic vowed to make energy security its priority during its EU presidency which started on July 1.  Sikela said earlier the energy market had ceased to function properly amid the cut in Russian supplies.  ""To some extent, the market has gotten out of control, market volatility no longer responds to good news, while the bad news is accumulating and it is pushing prices up,"" Sikela said.  ""It's a problem of the entire Europe and of course if you have the European market and a pan-European problem, the easiest way to look for a solution is on the pan-European level,"" he told reporters on Wednesday.  Among possible solutions, Sikela mentioned price ceilings and the diversification of prices depending on the type of energy production.  The EU has targeted the Russian energy sector in its sanctions, banning coal imports from Russia.  Its plan to cut gas consumption across the bloc by 15 percent to cope with the energy price crisis came into effect earlier this month.  The aim is for the EU to be able to bolster its reserves of gas in time for what is likely to be a very tough winter.  Some member countries, however, have had carve-outs from strictly following the rule as they are too dependent on Russian supplies.  frj/amj/cdw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The nationwide power saving campaign was announced this week Russia has cut gas supplies to Finland and other European countries in recent months, causing energy prices to soar.  Called ""A degree lower"", the campaign will be launched on October 10, Kati Laakso, a spokeswoman at state-owned company Motiva which promotes sustainability, told AFP on Friday.  The company is behind the campaign together with the Finnish government and energy authority.  In addition to lowering their heating and taking shorter showers, Finns will be encouraged to cut back on sauna time.   With an estimated three million saunas for 5.5 million people, the steam bath is a traditional Finnish institution. Bathers gather together in the nude in temperatures of around 85 degrees Celsius (185F).  With energy prices soaring, the campaign will also urge Finns to spend less time on entertainment electronics, turn off garage heating and save on petrol by driving slower.  ""These are just some options. We hope that people will voluntarily follow the recommendations and understand the situation, that we are heading into a difficult winter,"" Laakso said.  ""Maybe people don't need to turn on the sauna everyday. Maybe just once a week"", she added.   This is the first time an energy saving campaign has been introduced in Finland since the 1970s oil crisis.  In May, Russian energy giant Gazprom halted supplies to neighbouring Finland after Helsinki refused to pay its bill in rubles, which Moscow had demanded in a bid to side-step financial sanctions and force European energy clients to prop up its central bank.  In 2021, Gazprom supplied about two thirds of the country's gas consumption but only eight percent of its total energy use.

The internet went down on the eve of the vote, with some parts of the country reporting complete disruptions or significant slowdowns, after one of the most violent campaigns in years.  Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, having ruled for almost four decades, against singer-turned-MP Bobi Wine, 38, whose popularity among a youthful population has rattled the former rebel leader.  In the Kamwokya slum, where Wine grew up and is hugely popular, voters streamed to a polling station as police tried to enforce social distancing after weeks of surging coronavirus cases in the East African nation.  A group of about two dozen riot officers marched past, with heavy military and police presence in other parts of the capital.  ""I am here to change the leadership of this nation because for years they've been telling me they will secure my future. They have not done that,"" said driver Joseph Nsuduga, 30, one of the first in line to vote.  ""I need to see change for my children. People are yearning for change but we are seeing nothing.""  Voting was delayed in several locations in the capital Kampala, beginning about half an hour after the official starting time of 7am (0400 GMT). Polls close at 4pm (1200 GMT).  Some 18 million voters are registered for the presidential and parliamentary vote, and results are expected by Saturday.  Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  The run-up to polling day was marred by a sustained crackdown on Museveni's rivals and government critics, and unprecedented attacks on the nation's media and human rights defenders.  In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces loyal to Museveni during protests against one of Wine's numerous arrests.  On Wednesday armoured-personnel carriers with mounted machine guns patrolled parts of Kampala and army helicopters and surveillance drones flew over the teeming capital where the political opposition has traditionally enjoyed support.  The energetic and often genial Museveni is active on social media such as Twitter -- where he released an exercise video to help citizens stay fit during lockdown -- and retains support among voters such as Ceria Makumbi, 52.  ""He has brought security to our country... He built hospitals, roads and brought Uganda to an international standard,"" the businesswoman told AFP.    - Little oversight -    The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  In a statement, US ambassador Natalie Brown warned the refusal meant the election ""will lack the accountability, transparency and confidence"" brought by independent oversight.  On Tuesday, Museveni announced the suspension of social media networks and messaging services like Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp in response to Facebook closing accounts linked to government officials the tech giant said were spreading misinformation.  Wine is the strongest of 10 opposition contenders trying to unseat Museveni.  But most observers expect the ageing president and his ruling National Resistance Movement to emerge victorious.  He has never lost an election, and has been counting down the days to victory in confident campaign advertisements, promising to invest more in infrastructure, health and education and build Uganda's economy.  But Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has accused the president of presiding over corruption and failing to deliver jobs.    - Generation gap -    The population has a median age of just less than 16, and many Ugandans have never known anyone but Museveni in charge.  In Kamwokya Cate Nabbale, 20, a primary school teacher, voted for the first time.  ""I am so excited ... I want to see Uganda growing, things changing,"" she told AFP.  Wine has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.   The opposition leader has urged them to turn out in large numbers and vote, saying they should not fear intimidation by the authorities.  Museveni has warned his opponents against taking to the streets.  ""If you use violence to protest against an election result, that is treason,"" Museveni said in a national address Tuesday.  str-np-fb/fox   FACEBOOK    Twitter","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

A furious Beijing is planning its biggest-ever exercises around Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the self-ruled island.  Ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting in Phnom Penh warned against ""provocative action"".  The situation ""could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers,"" the ministers said in a joint statement published Thursday.  Beijing, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory to one day be reclaimed, by force if necessary, was enraged by the trip by Pelosi -- the highest-profile elected US official to visit the island in 25 years.  It vowed ""punishment"" and announced military drills, including live-fire exercises, expected to begin at 0400 GMT in several areas encircling Taiwan.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, in Phnom Penh for talks with ASEAN, condemned the Chinese response.  ""There is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait. It is normal and routine for legislators from our countries to travel internationally,"" he tweeted.  Kung Phoak, Cambodia's deputy foreign minister and ASEAN spokesman, urged both sides to stabilise the situation.   ""We hope de-escalation happens... and normalcy returns to the Taiwan Strait,"" he told reporters.  ASEAN is split between countries with close ties to China, such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, and others that are warier of Beijing and its growing international assertiveness.   But no ASEAN country formally recognises Taiwan and none have shown an appetite for backing Taipei against the communist giant.  bur-pdw/cwl",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113435201']

A nation divided. Deep racial wounds.  Joe Biden has his work cut out for him as he prepares to be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday.  ""What's unique for Biden is not so much the fact of crisis, it's the number of competing crises,"" said Mary Stuckey, a communications professor at Penn State University.  Perhaps the biggest is the coronavirus pandemic, which has left some 400,000 Americans dead.  ""We have 4,000 Americans dying of Covid every day,"" said David Farber, a history professor at the University of Kansas. ""And the federal rollout of the vaccine has been a disaster.  ""So I think that's front and center, and he's going to try to keep his mind focused on that.""  Biden has outlined a multi-pronged plan to combat the pandemic that includes expanded testing and contact tracing and vaccinating 100 million Americans in his first 100 days in the White House.    - A Rescue Plan -    But the coronavirus pandemic cannot consume all of the attention of the 78-year-old Biden, the oldest man ever to take the oath as president.  Not many American presidents have been met with an economic situation such as Biden is inheriting, although a few of his predecessors faced even worse.  ""In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt walked into the White House with 25 percent unemployment, the stock market having dropped nearly 90 percent and people not able to get their money out of the bank,"" Farber said.  ""America has weathered worse,"" he said, noting that Biden himself, as Barack Obama's vice president, helped navigate the 2008 economic crisis ""at a time when the world's economy seemed to be tanking.""  Biden recently proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package, dubbed the American Rescue Plan, to revitalize the world's largest economy.  It includes $400 billion to fight Covid-19, $440 billion for small businesses and others hard hit by the pandemic, and $1 trillion in aid to Americans, including direct stimulus payments of $1,400 to most Americans, on top of $600 payments made in December.    - 'Political legitimacy' -    Shirley Anne Warshaw, a political science professor at Gettysburg College, said the political polarization in the United States after four years under President Donald Trump presents an entirely different challenge.  ""I've never seen us quite this divided,"" Warshaw said of the chasm between Democrats and Republicans.  ""It's going to be very hard for President Biden to actually bring those people into the political fold,"" she said, into the ""normal realm of believing that government is working for them.""  Farber said Biden, after a failed insurrection by Trump supporters fueled by two months of the president's false claims that he won the election, faces a crisis of ""political legitimacy.""  ""It's a crisis, to be frank, like nothing the United States has seen maybe since Abraham Lincoln's inauguration"" on the eve of the 1861-1865 US Civil War, he said.  ""There really is no other analogy to this,"" Farber said, ""where you have a sitting president not accepting the legitimacy of the transition of power.  ""It's just not happened in the United States.""    - Impeachment trial -    Biden's first days in the Oval Office may be complicated by what happens with Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives on January 13 and faces a potential trial in the Senate.  ""That's going to just literally eat up time,"" Farber said, ""the time Biden needs to get his appointees in place, the time he could start some fundamental policy initiatives.  ""It's no way to start a new policy regime.""  And the outgoing president is unlikely to vanish from the political scene even if convicted by the Senate and barred from running for office again.  ""He will be a boisterous, crisis-driving force on the right, perhaps for the entire Biden presidency, and there's very little Biden can do about it,"" Farber said.    - Racial justice -    Biden is also taking the helm of a nation that has been rocked by months of protests for racial justice following the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police.  ""There's going to be a very large effort by the Biden administration to try and deal with that,"" Warshaw said. ""It's really been festering for years and years and years.""  Biden, with his cabinet appointments, has shown a ""willingness to create a diverse cabinet like the United States has never seen before,"" Farber said.  ""He's demonstrating to his supporters that the United States is trying to turn a new page on issues of racial justice,"" he said. ""This is a cabinet that will address racial justice concerns.""  Biden will begin tackling Covid-19, the economy and racial equity issues in his first 10 days on the job, according to incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain.  But that's not all, Klain said in a memo. Biden will also address another crisis -- the global climate crisis -- on Inauguration Day by taking steps to rejoin the Paris Agreement.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The following are the key dates in the separatist crisis in the wealthy northeastern region:    - Independence bid  -  On September 6, 2017, the separatist majority in Catalonia's regional parliament passes a law paving the way for an independence referendum on October 1.  It is fiercely opposed by Madrid. In February 2017, Spain's Constitutional Court had declared such a vote would be unconstitutional.  On October 1, security forces operating under a judicial mandate intervene in the referendum process, seizing ballot boxes in many polling stations. Images of police violence are beamed around the world.  Turnout is about 43 percent, with nine out of 10 voters backing independence, Catalan authorities say. The results cannot be verified, as there are no independent observers and police have disrupted the electronic count.  On October 3, after hundreds of thousands of Catalans rally in fury over police violence against voters, King Felipe VI sternly denounces the independence bid, and calls on national authorities to ""ensure constitutional order"".  On October 27, 70 separatist deputies -- just over half of the 135 lawmakers in the Catalan parliament -- unilaterally declare independence.  The central government immediately suspends Catalonia's autonomy, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its separatist leaders. It calls a regional election for December 21.    - Madrid gets tough -  On November 2, eight regional ministers are detained. A European arrest warrant is issued for Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont, who has fled to Brussels.   Catalans turn out in large numbers during a December 21 regional election, voting separatist parties back into power, including several candidates who are in prison and others who in self-imposed exile.  On June 2, 2018 Quim Torra is sworn in as Catalonia's new president and the region's autonomy is restored.  That same day a new Spanish prime minister, Socialist Pedro Sanchez, is sworn in.  He adopts a softer tone on Catalonia -- resuming dialogue with Torra -- but rules out any referendum on independence.    - Leaders sentenced -  Talks between Sanchez and Torra break down ahead of the start on February 12, 2019 of the trial of 12 separatists for their role in the independence bid.  On October 14, the Supreme Court hands down heavy prison sentences of between nine and 13 years to nine of the separatists, who are convicted of sedition.  Sanchez says it is time to ""turn the page"" in relations with Catalonia and focus on ""dialogue"".  Thousands of Catalans react to the sentences by pouring into the streets in protest, blocking roads and rail tracks and trying to paralyse Barcelona's airport.  Catalonia is rocked as separatists burn barricades and clash with riot police.    - Negotiation suspended -    Sanchez is sworn in for a second term in January 2020 with the support of Catalan separatist party ERC.  The party agreed to back him in exchange for the start of talks between Madrid and the Catalonia's regional government over the secession crisis.  The talks began on February 26 but were soon suspended due to the pandemic.  Torra in September 2020 is banned from holding public office for refusing to remove separatist symbols from public buildings, triggering Sunday's early election in Catalonia.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48838589']

One of the last opposition figures still in the country and not behind bars, the former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg was detained for his comments about Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.  A court in Yekaterinburg on Thursday ruled to place Roizman under ""restricted movement"" -- conditions similar to house arrest -- until September 29, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.  Roizman, 59, is allowed to leave his place of residence for only one minute a day, he can't attend public events, use the internet, or send and receive letters.   He is only allowed to communicate with close family members, his lawyer and investigators.

Roizman was detained in his home in Yekaterinburg on Wednesday when a dozen armed police in camouflage burst into his flat.   Police said Roizman was being charged for a video posted online, ""the contents of which discredited the use of"" the Russian armed forces.  He faces up to three years in jail.   Roizman has already been fined three times for criticising Russia's offensive in Ukraine.  He was a lawmaker between 2003 and 2007. In 2013, he became Russia's highest-profile opposition mayor and held the position for five years.  Last year he was sentenced to nine days in jail for urging people to join demonstrations in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.  Almost all of President Vladimir Putin's prominent political opponents have either fled the country or are in jail.

Government representative Jose Manuel Franco told Spain's public television that the blast occurred as a team of workmen were repairing the building's boiler.  Images broadcast on Spanish television showed cars destroyed by the force of the explosion and smoke billowing from the top floor of the six-storey building which housed local priests.  ""I was just leaving a nearby clinic when I heard a very big explosion, it was so big I thought it was a bomb,"" Valentin Moreno, a 48-year-old salesman told AFP.   ""There were people running and a lot of smoke and when I got there, I saw the building's facade had been completely destroyed.""

They are being treated by the ambulance crews and out of danger,"" it said.    The building is located next door to an elderly care home, but no-one there was hurt, the head of the residence told Spanish public television.   ""There are no injuries among staff or residents.

The lockdown meant the contingent of roughly 25,000 National Guard troops far outnumbered revellers, who were told to stay away due to America's out-of-control Covid spread and fears of violence.  ""This looks like the entrance to a military base... during war,"" said 42-year-old Joe Brunner from New York City, as he stood across from a checkpoint guarded by armed troops and military vehicles in central Washington.  Red dump trucks with ""God Bless America"" emblazoned on their sides served as security barriers at one of the most sensitive sites -- the north side of the White House where Biden was to arrive after his swearing in.  ""The atmosphere is very strange, it is very un-American"", said 36-year-old Jason Sheffield, adding the security zone and heavy police presence ""is unethical to freedom"" and ""very scary.""  For most Americans, the inauguration was watched on social media and TV.  Streets were nearly empty and many businesses in downtown Washington were boarded up, some due to the pandemic and others because of recent violent protests.  In recent years, tens of thousands of people have been close enough to the inauguration ceremony to see the president take the oath of office at the great domed Capitol building that hosts Congress.  The crowd has been massively pared down due to virus contagion concerns -- normally 200,000 passes would be distributed among lawmakers to hand out to their constituents.     - 'Today is kind of joyous' -    This year it was one ticket for each of the 535 members of Congress and one guest each.  On top of that, Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol building two weeks ago to try to undo Biden's election win, prompting extra heavy security.  ""All of the security services have gotten together and essentially shut down movement into Washington DC,"" G. Alexander Crowther, research professor at Florida International University and a retired Army colonel, told AFP.  The number of National Guard troops -- which is on top of thousands of police officers -- is about three times the roughly 8,000 on hand for Trump's inauguration.  Those troops would, outside a pandemic year, be guarding crowds on the Capitol grounds and many thousands more packing the roughly 700-acre (280-hectare) National Mall.   The 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama, America's first Black president, drew an estimated 450,000 spectators to the Mall.  Yet some  people defied the warnings and strolled the car-less streets to see what they could of America's handover of power.  ""I think today is kind of joyous,"" said downtown Washington resident Sheila Callahan.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said the order meant some 777s would ""likely"" be removed from service.   He said he had consulted with his team of aviation safety experts following Saturday's engine failure aboard a Boeing 777 airplane shortly after it took off from Denver.  ""I have directed them to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines,"" Dickson said in a statement released on Twitter.  According to NBC News, federal officials said Japan and South Korea also use planes with the PW4000 engine.   A video shot from inside the aircraft -- which had 231 passengers and 10 crew onboard -- showed the right engine ablaze and wobbling on the wing of the Boeing 777-200, its cover entirely missing as the aircraft returned to Denver airport.  There were no injuries on the plane or on the ground, authorities said.  Dickson said a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades.   ""Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes,"" Dickson said.   He added that FAA officials were meeting with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives Sunday evening.   Flight UA328 had been headed from Denver to Honolulu when it experienced an engine failure shortly after departure.   Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community, including a giant circular piece of metal that landed in someone's yard.  The pilots were able to return safely to Denver -- also known as the Mile High City.  The engine failure comes as a fresh blow for Boeing.   The manufacturer's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after 346 people died in two crashes -- the 2019 Lion Air disaster in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash the following year.  Investigators said a main cause of both crashes was a faulty flight handling system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.  Boeing was forced to revamp the system and implement new pilot training protocols.  The 737 MAX was a big hit with airlines, becoming Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft until its grounding, which has now been lifted.   After the Covid-19 crisis decimated demand, airlines cancelled hundreds of orders for the plane.  wat-to/wat   BOEING    GOL LINHAS AERAS INTELIGENTES    UNITED TECHNOLOGIES    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is under occupation by Moscow's troops and was disconnected from the national power supply on Thursday, the state energy operator said.  The United States cautioned Russia against redirecting energy from the site.  ""The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.  ""No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponise or divert energy from the plant.""  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine had informed it the plant temporarily lost connection -- ""further underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to travel to the facility"".  ""We can't afford to lose any more time. I'm determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days,"" the organisation's Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.  White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre urged Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant and ""allow the IAEA to visit as soon as possible to check on the safety.""  The Zaporizhzhia plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- has been occupied by Russian troops in southern Ukraine since the opening weeks of the war, and remained on the frontlines ever since.  Recently Moscow and Kyiv have traded blame for shelling around the complex, a ""highly volatile"" development the IAEA says ""underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"".  President Joe Biden, in a telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, called for Russia to return full control of the plant and let in UN nuclear inspectors, the White House said.  Zelensky said on Wednesday he had spoken with Biden and thanked him for the United States' ""unwavering"" support.  ""We discussed Ukraine's further steps on our path to the victory over the aggressor and importance of holding Russia accountable for war crimes"", Zelensky said on Twitter.  Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to increase the headcount of his country's army to more than two million, including 1.15 million servicemen, from next January, according to the document published on a government portal.   Putin last set the army headcount in 2017 at around 1.9 million people with 1.01 million soldiers.  Ukraine state operator Energoatom said the Zaporizhzhia plant was severed from the national network after a power line was twice disconnected by ash pit fires in an adjacent thermal power plant.  The three other power lines ""were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks"" by Russian forces, the operator said.  ""The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) from the power grid -- the first in the history of the plant,"" Energoatom added on Telegram.  It added that ""start-up operations are under way to connect one of the reactors to the network"".  Kyiv officials have said they believe Moscow has seized the station in order to divert power to the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.  Energoatom could not be immediately reached for comment on whether the supply had been diverted, the cause of the ash pit fires, or the number of those without electricity.  However, the mayor of the city of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov said ""Russian occupiers cut off the electricity in almost all occupied settlements of Zaporizhzhia"".    - Independence day deaths -    Meanwhile on Thursday the death toll from an air strike on a train station in central Ukraine rose to 25, as the EU warned those ""responsible for Russian rocket terror will be held accountable"".  Russia issued a counter-claim saying it targeted soldiers and killed 200 Ukrainian servicemen in the attack Wednesday on a rail hub in Chaplyne city of the Dnipropetrovsk region.   The attack struck six months to the day since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine and also on the day Ukraine celebrated its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union.  On Thursday, state rail operator Ukrainian Railways said the toll had risen overnight from 22 to 25, and included two children with a further 31 people injured.  Zelensky had warned at the weekend Russia might do something ""particularly cruel"" to mark Ukraine's independence celebrations.  In a daily press briefing, Moscow's defence ministry said the train was ""en route to combat zones"" in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, which Russia seeks to fully control.  But EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell ""strongly"" condemned ""another heinous attack by Russia on civilians"".  ""Those responsible for Russian rocket terror will be held accountable,"" he said on Twitter.  The UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown said the strike ""is just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine"".  ""In the six months since Russia's invasion, Ukrainians have continued to see their loved ones killed, injured and traumatised, their families separated, and their homes, schools and hospitals attacked,"" she said in a statement.  Ukraine claimed Thursday to have repatriated 53 children it said were illegally taken to Russia for adoption but gave no details about the operation to return them, adding that it was considering suing over the issue.  bur-jts/cdw/lcm/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

With Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock -- who ousted two Republicans in a pair of January 5 run-offs -- being formally seated, the body now stands deadlocked at 50-50.  That means Democrats control the chamber because new Vice President Kamala Harris acts as the tie-breaking vote.  Harris, herself a former senator from California, presided over the session just hours after becoming vice president, and swore in the two Georgia men and her own replacement, Alex Padilla.  By flipping the Senate and holding the House of Representatives in last November's election, Democrats now control all levels of power in Washington in a period of heightened political partisanship following the four-year presidency of Donald Trump.  That provides Biden an avenue to push through some of his key legislative priorities on climate change, immigration, and a $1.9 trillion relief package to help American families and businesses devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.  The Democratic shift means top Republican Senator Mitch McConnell cedes power to his rival, Senator Chuck Schumer, who becomes the first-ever majority leader born in the state of New York.  In his first speech leading the Senate, the 70-year-old Schumer described himself as ""a kid from Brooklyn, the son of an exterminator and a housewife, a descendant of victims of the Holocaust.""  Senate control should mean Biden will have an easier time getting his cabinet members and judge picks confirmed. But passing aggressive legislation is likely to be a far more difficult proposition.  Schumer nevertheless sounded a note of high optimism about the future now that Trump, who incited a mob of his supporters to storm the US Capitol two weeks ago in a bid to prevent the certification of Biden's election win, has exited the White House.  ""I would challenge anyone not to feel hopeful today,"" Schumer said.  ""Today, the threat to democracy from the presidency itself has ended, but the challenges we face as a nation remain.""   McConnell congratulated both Biden and Harris on their inaugurations, and said they begin their terms ""with the prayers of our whole nation at their backs.""  And he specifically noted Biden's call for unity, saying he looked forward to ""working with our new president wherever possible.""

The explosion occurred as people were offering evening prayers at the mosque, in a northwest district of Kabul.  The Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said it had received 27 victims from the blast, including three fatalities.  ""Most of the patients we received following the explosion inside a mosque are suffering from shell and burn injuries,"" it said via email.  In a later tweet, the hospital said five children were among those it treated, including a seven-year-old.  Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed there were dead and wounded in the blast, but did not specify how many.

On August 11, a suicide bomber blew himself up inside the madrassa of cleric Rahimullah Haqqani, who was killed along with his brother.  The attack was claimed by the jihadist Islamic State group (IS).  Since the Taliban seized power a year ago, there has been significant fall in violence across the country.  However, IS has regularly carried out attacks, primarily targeting minority communities like Shiites, Sufis and Sikhs.  The Taliban say they have defeated the IS, but experts claim the group remains a key security challenge for the hardline Islamists.  Last week, a senior Taliban cleric known for his fiery speeches against IS was killed at his madrassa in the Afghan capital in a suicide attack claimed by the jihadist group.  Rahimullah Haqqani had survived at least two previous assassination attempts -- including one in Pakistan in October 2020.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113551461', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113550033']"

The tape, a rebel push by scores of Republican lawmakers to challenge Biden's electoral win later this week, a pair of runoffs in Georgia to decide control of the US Senate and expected pro-Trump protests in Washington are combining to set the stage for a fiery week in American politics.  Lawmakers got back to work Sunday on Capitol Hill, where Democrat Nancy Pelosi was narrowly reelected as speaker of the House of Representatives, but the real political fireworks were to come later in the week.  Following the release of the recording, Democrats and a few Republicans heaped scorn on the outgoing president, who fired off a tweetstorm of unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the November 3 election.  The taped conversation between Trump and fellow Republican Brad Raffensperger, first obtained by the Washington Post, includes vague threats by Trump that Raffensperger and another official could face ""a big risk"" if they failed to take moves toward overturning Biden's victory.  ""There's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated"" the vote tally, Trump is heard saying on the tape.  ""You're off by hundreds of thousands of votes.""  Raffensperger is heard responding: ""Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.""  Biden won the long Republican-leaning state by fewer than 12,000 votes -- a narrow margin but one that has remained unchanged through a series of recounts and audits.   ""The current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right?"" Trump says. ""So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes.""  Making Trump's call more surprising is the fact that even a hypothetical reversal in Georgia, which has 16 Electoral College votes, would not overturn victory by Biden, who won by a margin of 306 to 232.  Ahead of the release of the audio, Trump tweeted about the call, saying that Raffensperger ""was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the 'ballots under table' scam, ballot destruction, out of state 'voters', dead voters, and more.""  Raffensperger tweeted back, also ahead of the release of the audio, saying: ""Respectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out.""  After the release, the White House declined to comment.  Democrats reacted furiously.  ""Trump's contempt for democracy is laid bare. Once again. On tape,"" leading Democratic lawmaker Adam Schiff said on Twitter.   One moderate Republican, Congressman Adam Kinzinger, tweeted: ""This is absolutely appalling. To every member of Congress considering objecting to the election results, you cannot -- in light of this -- do so with a clean conscience.""    - Key elections in Georgia -    It was unclear what impact the tape's release might have on the twin runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday, which will decide who controls the US Senate.  Both Trump and Biden are due to appear at rallies in the southern state on Monday.  Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are facing off against Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.  Victory by Ossoff and Warnock would give Democrats, and Biden, a major boost -- Senate seats would be evenly divided between the parties at 50 each, but incoming Vice President Kamala Harris would wield a tie-breaking vote. Democrats already control the House.  ""This is going to be a very tough battle but it is absolutely within the realm of possibility -- in fact, the realm of likelihood -- the Democrats can win,"" Stacey Abrams, the charismatic former Georgia lawmaker who has emerged as a party leader, told CNN on Sunday.    - 'Time to move forward' -    News of the Trump tape came hours after the US Congress opened its new session Sunday.  Pelosi, the highest-ranking woman in the history of US politics, will serve another term as speaker of the House after her reelection.  Congress will convene in a rare joint session on Wednesday to certify Biden's election result -- but it will not be the usual dry pro forma affair.  So far, 12 Republican senators loyal to Trump have announced plans to block certification, instead demanding the formation of a special commission to do an ""emergency"" election audit.  With Democrats controlling the House and many Senate Republicans expected to confirm Biden's victory, the rebel effort is all but certain to fail, but it has raised tensions on Capitol Hill.   It has also underscored a sharp divide within the president's party , as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has asked his caucus to respect the Electoral College result.  Senator Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 presidential candidate, called the campaign an ""egregious ploy"" that served only to ""enhance the political ambition of some.""  He and a bipartisan coalition of senators on Sunday called on Congress to certify the result, saying: ""The 2020 election is over. (...) It is time to move forward.""  Pro-Trump protesters not quite willing to concede are expected to rally in Washington on Wednesday.  Trump, who has urged thousands to support his cause, tweeted Sunday: ""I will be there.

Polls point to a first-round win for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator turned approachable head of state known for candid moments like queueing at the supermarket in shorts, plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized or sharing a meal with homeless people.  But observers have their eye on how a far-right challenger will perform -- and whether a plunge in turnout could produce an upset.  At stake is a post with the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power.  Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at braking a surge in coronavirus cases.  The country recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll and number of new infections on Saturday bringing fatalities to over 10,000.  More than 80,000 infections were reported in the past week to Friday, the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its 10.8 million people, according to an AFP tally based on government figures.  Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants.    - Keep it to one round -    In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa -- one of the rare politicians often referred to simply by his first name -- urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round.  That would ""spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks"" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said.  ""An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable,"" the 72-year-old warned.  Low turnout could also upset the expected easy win for Rebelo de Sousa, with polls giving him 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of socialist challenger Ana Gomes and far-right populist Andre Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent.  A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way.  Nevertheless, in a long political career ""I've seen more failures than victories, so I keep things in perspective"", ""Marcelo"" said recently when asked if he hadn't been campaigning hard enough.  ""When I lost it wasn't the end of the world. And when I won, I didn't think I was the best.""    - Far-right challenge -    Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government.  He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist.  Meanwhile Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- ""Enough"" -- says he is in the running to ""crush the Left"", which is fielding three out of the seven candidates.  Portugal has so far been largely spared the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years.  Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.  Polls opened at 8 am (0800 GMT). Media projections of results will begin once polls close at 2000 GMT in Portugal's Azores islands.  tsc/at/gd/bp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48861733']

Leaders of the EU's 27 countries agreed the embargo in April in their first move targeting Russia's key energy exports over its war on its pro-Western neighbour.   The measure was subject to a 120-day grace period before full implementation, to allow pre-existing contracts to be fulfilled.   The EU up to last year imported some 45 percent of its coal -- worth an estimated four billion euros ($4.1 billion) -- from Russia.   Overall, the bloc slashed its consumption of the polluting fossil fuel from 1.2 billion tonnes to 427 million tonnes between 1990 and 2020 as it pushed to hit climate goals.   But the closure of many mines across the continent led to an increase in Europe's dependence on imports.  Some countries including Germany and Poland that used it to produce electricity were particularly reliant on Moscow.   In the face of cuts to Russian gas deliveries in recent months, EU members such as Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Italy have stepped up their use of coal-fired power plants.   Adding to the energy crunch, an EU plan to cut natural gas use by 15 percent in the face of rocketing prices came into force earlier this week.   During the first five months of 2022, the amount of electricity Germany produces from coal rose by 20 percent, according to energy analyst Rystad.   The embargo on Russia has pushed the EU to step up imports from other sources, including the United States, Australia, South Africa and Indonesia.   But ending imports of Russian coal has already proved complicated for traditional mining nation Poland, which imported roughly 10 million tonnes from Moscow each year.   Its government imposed a total ban on Russian coal imports in mid-April, causing severe shortages and a surge in prices.   The cost of a tonne of coal in Poland rose around fourfold from a year ago, leading to protests from the three million Poles still using it to heat their homes.   The populist authorities responded by capping prices and rationing purchases amid fears over how many would fare during the upcoming winter.  But promises to increase exports from other sources have been stymied by a lack of capacity for Poland's rail and port infrastructure to handle higher volumes.   bo-jmg/del/rmb/spm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

""He's off the ventilator, so the road to recovery has begun,"" Andrew Wylie said in a statement sent to multiple media outlets.  ""It will be long; the injuries are severe, but his condition is headed in the right direction,"" Wylie said.  The agent said earlier that Rushdie might lose an eye; he also suffered injuries to the abdomen.  The author's son said Sunday the family was ""extremely relieved"" that Rushdie is off the ventilator and has been able to ""say a few words.""  ""Though his life-changing injuries are severe, his usual feisty and defiant sense of humour remains intact,"" Zafar Rushdie said in a statement.  The author, who spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders called for his killing over his portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed in his novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" was about to address a literary festival Friday in western New York state when a man rushed the stage and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and abdomen.  The suspected assailant, Hadi Matar, 24, was wrestled to the ground by staff and other audience members before being taken into police custody.   He was arraigned in court on Saturday and pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges.    - Questions surround suspect -    Police and prosecutors have provided scant information about Matar's background or the possible motivation behind his attack.  Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.  An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there.   Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.  The 75-year-old Rushdie had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989, when Iran's then-supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.  The fatwa followed the publication of Rushdie's novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" which enraged some Muslims who said it was blasphemous.    - 'Back to normal' -      In a recent interview with Germany's Stern magazine, Rushdie had spoken of how, after so many years living with death threats, his life was ""getting back to normal.""  ""For whatever it was, eight or nine years, it was quite serious,"" he told a Stern correspondent in New York.  ""But ever since I've been living in America, since the year 2000, really there hasn't been a problem in all that time.""  After his move to New York, Rushdie became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  Security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community near the city of Buffalo.  The stabbing triggered international outrage from politicians, literary figures and ordinary people.  US President Joe Biden on Saturday called it a ""vicious"" attack and praised Rushdie for ""his refusal to be intimidated or silenced."" British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled.""  But the attack also drew applause from Islamist hardliners in Iran and Pakistan.  Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Leftist economist Arauz leads the field with 32.3 percent of the vote following Sunday's general election with over 97.5 percent of results declared, but indigenous rights activist Perez and right-wing ex-banker Guillermo Lasso are locked in a fierce battle to finish second.  Arauz told AFP he hoped victory in the April 11 run-off would ""build a project of national unity, in which we can have a greater level of self-criticism and invite the different segments of our society to unite on an emergency economic and health plan.""  The vote took place amid a backdrop of economic problems exacerbated by a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed 15,000 lives in Ecuador.  Sunday's polls were marred by long lines of people waiting to cast ballots as virus restrictions caused chaos.  The battle for second place has been full of twists, the latest of which has been Perez's accusations.  ""A fraud is being connived... to prevent us from reaching the second round,"" Perez told the press.  Initial exit polls suggested Lasso would face Arauz in the run-off, only to be upended when an official projection by the country's National Electoral Council based on partial results pointed to Perez.  The gap between the two candidates has narrowed again, though, with Perez on 19.8 percent and Lasso on 19.6 percent.  But the Electoral Council has said it is revising almost 14 percent of votes due to inconsistencies.  ""There's panic that we'll get to the second round,"" said Perez, alleging that he'd lost 15 percentage points to other candidates after some of his votes were registered to others.    - End to corruption? -    The country's 13.1 million voters are choosing a successor to unpopular socialist President Lenin Moreno and the 137 members of congress.  Strict health precautions appeared to slow voting and may have discouraged some from casting their ballots, as long lines stretched outside polling stations.  The field had been congested, with 16 candidates, including Ximena Pena, the only woman.   Arauz, 36, represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while lawyer Perez, 51, is from the leftist Pachakutik party, and is the first indigenous candidate to get this far in the presidential race.  Arauz is a protege of Rafael Correa, a two-time president who currently lives in Belgium to evade a conviction for corruption but remains a strong force in the country.  ""People have voted not in direct support to Arauz but because he is the Correa candidate,"" political scientist Karen Garzon Sherdek, from the International University SEK, told AFP.  ""Thank you dear Ecuador!"" Correa tweeted as the results came in. ""The Citizen Revolution has won overwhelmingly, despite a dirty campaign and 4 years of brutal persecution and infamy.""  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year, austerity-driven hiatus under Moreno.  However, he vowed to take a different approach to relations with the US from that of Correa, who aligned himself with socialist regimes in Venezuela and Bolivia.  ""Our relations with the United States will be excellent, especially now with the administration of President (Joe) Biden,"" said Arauz.  He has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.    - Under pressure -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno amid crashing crude prices.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, did not seek reelection. His four-year term will end on May 24.  sp-pld/vel/bc/ft","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76763779', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84078919']"

Results published by the ex-Soviet country's Central Election Commission (CEC) showed Japarov with close to 80 percent of the vote after an automated count.  A referendum held in parallel showed the public strongly preferring presidential rule, which would grant Japarov sweeping powers when a new constitution is put to the people later this year.  Speaking at his campaign headquarters, Japarov promised to end corruption that he said had ""taken root in practically all areas of life"" in the impoverished republic of 6.5 million people.   ""We won't repeat the mistakes of previous governments,"" he vowed.  The vote for presidential rule spells the end of a political system adopted a decade ago to tame authoritarianism, after two successive strongman presidents were ejected from power during street protests in 2005 and 2010.  Just over 10 percent supported a parliamentary system.  Japarov said Sunday that he expected a referendum on the constitution and fresh parliamentary elections to take place before June.  The 52-year-old was serving jail time on hostage-taking charges until mass protests in October saw him freed by supporters and propelled to the top of the political pyramid.  CEC data Sunday showed his closest competitor, nationalist Adakhan Madumarov, trailing with less than 7 percent.  But turnout on the chilly day was just over 39 percent, it said.  Japarov's journey from prison to the presidency is an example of the dramatic changes in political fortunes in the Central Asian country that is both more unpredictable and pluralistic than its authoritarian neighbours.  While in jail, Japarov lost both his parents and a son -- sacrifices that many voters referenced when explaining their support for him.  Gulbara Shamshiyeva, a 32-year-old housewife, told AFP: ""My hopes are tied up with Sadyr.""     - Crime, corruption -    ""I believe he will develop our country and make it prosperous,"" she said, standing on the square in Bishkek that witnessed clashes between police and protesters in October.  Critics of Japarov, who became acting leader during the unrest, fear his victory and the vote for presidential rule could tip Kyrgyzstan towards the authoritarianism dominant in ex-Soviet Central Asia.   He himself has projected an image as an uncompromising opponent of organised crime and systemic corruption, lashing out at critics who speculated that criminal networks helped his rise to power.  But he struck a unifying tone in his last campaign appearance on Friday in Bishkek.  ""Let us come together... treat each other with understanding and respect. We are one country, one people,"" he told crowds of several thousand people.  With a threadbare economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Kyrgyzstan's next leader is likely to be even more dependent on Russia -- a destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrants -- and neighbouring economic giant China.  Russian President Vladimir Putin described the overthrow of the previous government as a ""misfortune"" and also chided Kyrgyz politicians for attempting to imitate Western democracies.  Beijing's ambassador met with Kyrgyz officials several times last year to discuss protection for Chinese businesses, some of which were attacked during the unrest.  The crisis that allowed for Japarov's overnight rehabilitation and rise to power was sparked by vote-buying campaigns favouring former president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.  Jeenbekov resigned at the insistence of Japarov's supporters and after agreeing to sign off on Japarov's election as prime minister by parliament.  Japarov also became acting president following the resignation during the political chaos but he stepped down from both roles to compete in the vote.  Yet rivals complained that his campaign benefited from the resources of the state, where his allies now occupy top posts.  Bekjol Nurmatov, a 77-year-old retiree, accused Japarov of ""plunging the people into chaos"" last year.    The pensioner noted that Japarov had failed to show up for televised debates between candidates and accused him of ""hiding from the people.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024']

Hundreds were also injured when the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours, triggering panic among the terrified residents of the island, which was hit by a huge quake and tsunami two and a half years ago that killed thousands.  So far, 29 bodies have been hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of about 110,000 in West Sulawesi province, while another eight were killed south of the area after the quake struck.  ""We don't know how many more are missing,"" said Arianto from the rescue agency in Mamuju, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.  ""There are still people trapped beneath the rubble.""  Rescuers were searching for more than a dozen patients and staff trapped under a levelled Mamuju hospital.   ""The hospital is flattened -- it collapsed,"" Arianto said.  Earlier Friday, rescuers said they were also trying to reach a family of eight who were under their destroyed home.  At least one hotel had partially collapsed, while the regional governor's office also suffered extensive damage after the quake struck at 2:18 am local time Friday (1818 GMT Thursday).  A Mamuju resident said damage across the city was severe.  ""Roads are cracked and many buildings collapsed,"" said 28-year-old Hendra, who also goes by one name.  ""The quake was very strong... I woke up and ran away with my wife.""  - Tsunami panic -    Images from the scene showed residents trying to flee the seaside city in cars and motorbikes as they drove past corrugated metal roofs and other building debris scattered on the roadside.   But landslides triggered by heavy rains and the quake blocked the main access road out of Mamuju.  The meteorological agency warned residents that the area could be hit by strong aftershocks and to avoid the beachfront in case of a tsunami.  ""The aftershocks could be as strong, or stronger, than this morning's quake,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, chief of the meteorological agency.  ""There is potential for a tsunami from subsequent aftershocks... Don't wait for a tsunami first because they can happen very quickly,"" she added.  The warning sparked more fear in the quake-jolted city.  ""(Everyone) is panicking because authorities are saying there will be aftershocks that could cause a tsunami,"" Mamuju resident Zulkifli Pagessa told AFP.  The city's airport had also been damaged, authorities said.  The Indonesian Red Cross said it was rushing medical and relief supplies to the scene, with its teams working to help find trapped residents.  ""Our first priority is to search for survivors and tend to the wounded,"" said Sudirman Said, secretary general of the local Red Cross.   ""These hours are critical for saving lives. We are working double time to help injured survivors, keep them safe from Covid-19 and provide relief to the thousands who have been displaced from their homes,"" he added.  The quake's epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and it had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres, the United States Geological Survey said.  Hanafi, a 47-year-old who lives in nearby Majene which also suffered damage and casualties, said: ""The wall of my house collapsed. The refrigerator, the cupboard all tumbled onto the floor.""  Images supplied by the search-and-rescue agency showed rescue workers checking on two young girls who were trapped under the rubble of one structure.   Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.   In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.   On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.  bur-pb/axn",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

At least 13 civilians have been killed since miiltants from the Al-Qaeda affiliate unleashed a gun and bomb attack on the popular Hayat Hotel on Friday evening, according to Somali officials.   Security forces are now striking the building with heavy weapons, witness Salaad Ali said.  ""Part of the hotel is on fire, there were at least two heavy explosions and several other smaller scale ones,"" said Ali, who told AFP he was watching the drama unfold from the rooftop of another building.  ""We can see the flames of the weapons used, the fire is raging and we can still hear sporadic gunfire.""  Scores of people were trapped when the assault began and although officials said dozens had been rescued, including children, it is not known how many remain inside.  Unverified pictures posted online showed security officials walking through piles of rubble, with reports of widespread damage to the hotel.    The government has yet to make any public comment on the attack, the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June after months of political instability.  Al-Shabaab, which has been waging a deadly insurgency for 15 years against the fragile government in the Horn of Africa nation, has claimed responsibility.   Security commander Mohamed Abdikadir told AFP that the number of civilians confirmed to have died was 13, while police officer Ibrahim Duale put the toll at more than 10.  The director of Mogadishu's main trauma hospital, Mohamed Abdirahman Jama, said it was treating at least 40 people wounded in the hotel attack and a separate mortar strike on a seaside area, Hamar Jajab.  ""Among those critically wounded are a newlywed bride and her groom and a family of three children, a mother and their father,"" Hamar Jajab district commissioner Mucawiye Muddey told AFP.    - Children found hiding in toilet -     One woman, Hayat Ali, said three young relatives aged between four and seven were found by security forces hiding in a hotel toilet in a state of shock but were later reunited with their family.  Another survivor told AFP he and some colleagues had performed evening prayers before taking tea in one of the hotel's open spaces when they heard the first explosions Friday, the start of the weekend in the mainly Muslim country.  ""I managed to run to a nearby exit gate away from the gunmen,"" Hussein Ali said. ""The gunmen started firing and I could hear the shots behind me, but thanks to God... we managed to escape.""  Somalia's allies including the United States, Britain and Turkey as well as the UN have strongly condemned the attack.  ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024, voiced ""solidarity with the Federal Government of Somalia to continue with the joint fight against the terrorists"".  Witnesses had reported at least two powerful explosions on Friday as gunmen burst into the hotel, a popular spot for local officials and lawmakers.  Police said the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with other gunmen.  Witnesses said a second explosion occurred just minutes later, inflicting more casualties as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to the scene.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces were still in control of the building and that they had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  The jihadists have carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopia border.  Earlier this week, the United States announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - Decades of chaos -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Al-Shabaab was driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 by AU forces, but still controls swathes of countryside and is able to launch deadly strikes on political, civilian and military targets, with hotels and restaurants often hit.  Earlier this month, Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre appointed the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow defected from Al-Shabaab in 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5 million bounty for his capture.  Somalia has been mired in chaos since the fall of president Siad Barre's military regime in 1991, with civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in  Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  nur-txw/har",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

With less than a year to go before a general election, it's a question that has bitterly divided Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government, testing NATO's patience.  German armed forces have so far only been allowed to use reconnaissance drones as part of military missions in Mali and Afghanistan, leaving it to other international partners to deploy armed drones.  In 2018, Germany signed a contract to lease five new Heron TP drones from Israeli manufacturer IAI with the initial purpose of using them only for surveillance, although they can be equipped with missiles if desired.   Merkel's conservatives and their centre-left Social Democratic (SPD) coalition partners agreed at the time that parliament would have the final say on any future arming of the drones.  Any kind of military action remains a sensitive issue in Germany, a nation scarred by its past as the instigator of two world wars.   But calls have also grown louder in recent years for Germany, as a major European country with considerable political and economic clout, to take on more international responsibility in matters of defence and security.  Merkel's CDU/CSU conservatives have backed arming the remote-control drones, along with some SPD members. The liberal FDP and far-right AfD opposition parties are also in favour.  The opposition Greens and the far-left Die Linke are fiercely opposed.  The debate came to a head in mid-December when SPD co-leader Norbert Walter-Borjans and the chairman of SPD's parliamentary group, Rolf Muetzenich, unexpectedly spoke out against the arming of the unmanned aerial vehicles.  A vote in the German parliament has now been postponed indefinitely.    - 'Killing by joystick' -      ""The line between defending the lives and limbs of our soldiers and killing with a joystick is very thin,"" Walter-Borjans said.  But the chairman of the prestigious annual Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, disagrees.  ""What does a pilot (of a fighter plane) do, if not kill by joystick, by pressing a button 50 kilometres away, without seeing his target, and firing an air-to-ground missile?""   Muetzenich said he wants a comprehensive ethical debate on ""automated killing"" by the Bundeswehr armed forces, which he says half of Germans oppose.  ""It disturbs me that almost only the military -- those responsible for armaments and defence -- have a say, but never doctors or Church representatives,"" he said.  Andre Wuestner, the head of Germany's armed forces union, said there had been several years ""of discussions on five, I stress, five armed drones"".  The blockage has been criticised even within the SPD. The party's defence spokesman, Fritz Felgentreu, resigned in protest at the SPD's decision.    - 'Cowardice' -    German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a close Merkel ally, has accused the junior coalition partner of ""cowardice"".  ""We have drawn up operational principles, which stipulate that armed drones can only be used defensively by the Bundeswehr -- to protect its own people,"" she said.  Other conservatives, including the CDU's defence expert Henning Otte, have accused the SPD of trying to score points with left-wing voters in the run-up to the elections.  Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg of the NATO military alliance has also waded into the spat.  ""These drones can support our troops on the ground and, for example, reduce the number of pilots we put at risk,"" Stoltenberg told German news agency DPA, pointing to the use of the technology against the jihadist Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.   NATO members France and Turkey are among those already using armed drones.  Armed drones, manufactured by Israel or Turkey, were also deployed by Azerbaijan against Armenia in the recent conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.  Weaponised drones are also a key part of a cross-border project, led by France, Germany and Spain and known as FCAS, to develop a new air-combat system for European forces by 2026.  In Germany, the issue won't be settled ""during this parliamentary term"", Walter-Borjans said, setting the stage for months of heated discussions between the warring parties before Germans head to the polls in September.  mat-edf/mfp/pvh","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26773028', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96145859']"

The charismatic 60-year-old was due to cast his vote at a polling station on the corner of a dusty alley, between concrete block houses and small shops in Luanda's working-class Nova Vida district.  Around 33 percent of Angolans are aged between 10 and 24, according to UN data, and millions of young people have high expectations for the election.  ""Young people are the future of the country. We have oil, diamonds, but people have no work,"" said Manuel Antonio Teca, an unemployed 27-year-old.  ""I'm really annoyed,"" he said, waiting in line to cast his ballot.  ""This country is not doing well, we need change. We need Adalberto Costa Junior to become our president"".  Costa Junior, leader of the main opposition UNITA, has wowed disgruntled young voters, and poses the greatest challenge to the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which has ruled the oil- and gem -ich country for nearly 50 years.  He is up against MPLA leader and incumbent President Joao Lourenco, who is widely respected abroad for his economic reforms and as a peace mediator in the central African region.  Analysts say the MPLA is facing its most serious challenge since the country's first multiparty vote in 1992.  A talented orator, Costa Junior has captivated young urban voters with pledges to reform government and tackle poverty and corruption -- though experts have been less convinced by the opposition's manifesto.  Around 14.7 million people are registered to vote in national elections at 13,200 polling stations across the vast southern African country.    - 'Adalberto, president!' -    Most people in Nova Vida support Costa Junior's party and think victory is within reach.   ""We have to believe in it,"" said Joaquim, a 29-year-old who gave only his first name as he waited for his turn to vote.  Older people were the first to cast their ballots at the polling station, while the young looked on and chatted, leaning against breeze blocks walls.  ""Did you vote, mum?"" one asked an elderly woman.  ""Yes, my son!"" she answered, raising her finger to show a blue ink mark on her fingertip.  About an hour and a half after polls opened, there was a stir among the voters.   ""He has arrived! Adalberto, president!"" some shouted.   The opposition leader walked out of a car, surrounded by a crowd of security guards, aides and feverish supporters, and cast his vote.  ""This is a historic day,"" he told journalists.  str-ub/sn/lcm/ah","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

The plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- was severed from Ukraine's power network for the first time in its history on Thursday due to ""actions of the invaders"", Energoatom said.  In an update, the operator said that as of 2:04 pm (1104 GMT) the plant ""is connected to the grid and produces electricity for the needs of Ukraine"" once again.  Zaporizhzhia has been cause for mounting concern since it was seized by Russian troops in the opening weeks of the war.  In recent weeks, Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame for rocket strikes around the facility in the southern Ukrainian city of Energodar.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Thursday the cut-off was caused by Russian shelling of the last active power line linking the plant to the network.   ""Russia has put Ukrainians as well as all Europeans one step away from radiation disaster,"" he said in his nightly address.  Energoatom said the outage was caused by ash pit fires at an adjacent thermal power plant, which damaged a line connecting the only two of the plant's six reactors in operation.  The three other power lines linking the complex to the national grid ""were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks"" by Russian forces, the operator said.  On Friday afternoon Energoatom said one reactor had been reconnected ""and capacity is being added"".    - No time to lose -    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has previously said the situation at the plant is ""highly volatile"" and ""underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"".  ""We can't afford to lose any more time,"" the organisation's Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on Thursday.  ""I'm determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days.""   Ukraine energy minister adviser Lana Zerkal said the inspection ""is planned for the next week, and now we are working on how they will get there"".  But in an interview with Ukraine's Radio NV on Thursday evening, she was sceptical the mission would go ahead, despite Moscow's formal agreement.  ""They are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission will not reach the site,"" she said.  Zelensky has said ""the IAEA and other international organisations should react much quicker"".  Energoatom did not disclose whether there were blackouts as a result of the power cut.  However, the mayor of the city of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov said on Thursday ""Russian occupiers cut off the electricity in almost all occupied settlements of Zaporizhzhia"".    - 'Unacceptable' -    Kyiv suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russian troops in 2014.  But on Thursday, Washington issued a direct warning against any such move.  ""The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.  ""Any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable.""  President Joe Biden, in a telephone conversation with Zelensky, also called for Russia to return full control of the plant and let in nuclear inspectors, the White House said.  Zelensky said he had spoken with Biden and thanked him for the United States' ""unwavering"" support.  Britain's defence ministry has warned that weekend satellite imagery shows an increased presence of Russian troops at the power plant.  Armoured personnel carriers were deployed within 60 metres (200 feet) of one reactor and ""Russian troops were probably attempting to conceal the vehicles by parking them under overhead pipes and gantries"".  ""Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near (the plant) for propaganda purposes,"" the ministry said.  bur-jts/jv",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Outgoing President Donald Trump entered the White House four years ago as a brash billionaire outsider, but he is being ousted by a polar opposite whose deep knowledge of Washington and personal scars will unquestionably set a different tone.  Biden, a 78-year-old former vice president and longtime senator, will take the oath of office at noon (1700 GMT) on the US Capitol's western front, the very spot where pro-Trump rioters clashed with police two weeks ago before storming Congress in a deadly insurrection.  While a transition of power will occur much as it has for more than two centuries, this inauguration is unlike any other.  Official Washington has taken on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat of this month's attack.  And with the pandemic raging, the general public is essentially barred from attending the swearing-in, leading to the unprecedented sight of an empty National Mall on Inauguration Day.  With the death toll soaring past 400,000, Biden on Tuesday led a powerful tribute to victims of Covid-19 as he arrived in Washington.  Biden, who has suffered deep personal tragedy and is known for his public displays of emotion, has stressed the need to unite the country after Trump's chaos.  ""It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" Biden said in somber remarks at the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial.    - Trump snub -    Inauguration eve is normally a time of massive crowds gathering in the capital, but Biden, joined by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, was almost alone at the reflecting pool.  On the Mall's grassy expanse, some 200,000 flags have been planted to represent the absent crowds at the inauguration.  Trump, who has not appeared in public for a week, broke days of silence with a pre-recorded farewell video address on Tuesday.  For the first time, he asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming administration -- a change from months spent persuading his Republican followers that the Democrats cheated their way to election victory.  Trump, whose efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and console its victims have been widely criticized, will snub Biden by not attending the inauguration.  He has also yet to personally congratulate Biden, who first ran for president in 1987, on his win, and did not invite him for the customary cup of tea in the Oval Office.  In one of his last acts before he flies to Florida on Wednesday morning, Trump issued scores of pardons to people convicted of crimes or facing charges, including several key allies.  Influential former Trump aide Steve Bannon -- charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall, a flagship Trump policy -- was among 73 people on a list released by the White House.  However, neither Trump nor his relatives were listed, amid speculation he could use the legally dubious tactic of a preemptive pardon to fend off future charges.  Former Trump fund-raiser Elliott Broidy was similarly pardoned, after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws.  The rapper Lil Wayne, who last month pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, and faced 10 years in jail, also made the list.  Tensions have soared on Capitol Hill, where the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.  The spectacle will clash with the opening days of Biden's tenure, as the new president seeks to swiftly confirm his Cabinet picks and push through ambitious legislation -- including a $1.9 trillion rescue package.    - 'I'll get right to work' -    ""We don't have a second to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face as a nation,"" Biden tweeted late Tuesday.  ""That's why after being sworn in tomorrow, I'll get right to work.""  He plans to kick off his tenure by rejoining the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, according to aides, who said Biden would sign 17 orders and actions just hours after being sworn in, setting new paths on immigration, the environment, Covid-19 and the economy.  In first-day moves, he will end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.  His inaugural speech will last between 20 and 30 minutes, according to a source familiar with preparations, and ""he will reach out to all Americans, and call on every citizen to be part of meeting the extraordinary challenges facing all of us.""  To symbolize the new spirit of unity, Biden has invited the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell -- and other congressional leaders to attend a church service with him Wednesday before the inauguration.  Overseas leaders weighed in to mark the end of a presidency which has deviated from orthodox American foreign policy.  Iran's President Hassan Rouhani hailed the White House departure of ""tyrant"" Trump, saying ""the ball is in America's court"" to return to a landmark nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Tehran.  Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the inauguration would ""be a demonstration of the resilience of American democracy,"" as well as ""the resounding proof that, once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House.""  sms-mlm/bgs/leg/oho/reb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab stormed the Hayat Hotel in Mogadishu on Friday evening in a hail of gunfire and bomb blasts, trapping scores of people although officials said many including children have been rescued.   Sporadic gunfire and loud explosions could still be heard into early Saturday afternoon, with reports of a fierce firefight in the hotel, although details remain difficult to verify in the chaos.  It is the biggest attack in Mogadishu since Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was elected in May after many months of political instability.  ""The security forces continued to neutralise terrorists who have been cordoned inside a room in the hotel building. Most of the people were rescued but at least eight civilians were confirmed dead so far,"" security commander Mohamed Abdikadir told AFP.  ""The security forces rescued dozens of civilians including children who were trapped in the building.""  Al-Shabaab, which has been waging a deadly insurgency against Somalia's fragile central government for 15 years, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was still in control of the hotel Saturday.  Dozens of people have been gathering outside the four-storey hotel to discover the fate of loved ones.  ""We have been looking for a relative of mine who was trapped inside the hotel, she was confirmed dead together with six other people, two of them I know,"" said an anxious Muudey Ali.  There has been no official comment from the government about the attack.   - Mortar attack injures newly-weds -     In another incident Saturday, 20 people including children were injured when a volley of mortar shells hit the seafront neighbourhood of Hamar Jajab, district commissioner Mucawiye Muddey told AFP.  ""Among those critically wounded are a newlywed bride and her groom and a family of three children, a mother and their father,"" he said.  There was no immediate claim for the attack.   In Friday's hotel assault, witnesses reported at least two powerful explosions as gunmen stormed the hotel, a popular spot frequented by government officials and ordinary Somalis in a bustling area on the airport road.  Police spokesman Abdifatah Adan Hassan had told reporters Friday that the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with several other gunmen.  Witnesses said a second blast occurred just a few minutes later, inflicting casualties on rescuers and members of the security forces and civilians who rushed to the scene after the first explosion.  The militants claimed responsibility in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website, saying its fighters were carrying out ""random shooting"" inside the hotel.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio on Saturday that its forces were still in control of the building and that they had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  Earlier this week, the United States announced that its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab fighters in an air strike in the central-southern part of the country as the Islamist militants were attacking Somali forces.  The US has carried out several air raids on the militants in recent weeks.   In May, President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia to help local authorities combat Al-Shabaab, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump to withdraw most US forces.  In recent weeks, Al-Shabaab fighters have also launched attacks on the Somalia-Ethiopia border, raising concerns about a possible new strategy by the jihadists.  - Decades of chaos -    Somalia's new president Mohamud said last month that ending Al-Shabaab's insurgency required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Al-Shabaab fighters were driven out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force, but the group still controls swathes of countryside.  It continues to launch deadly strikes on political, civilian and military targets, with popular hotels and restaurants frequently hit.  Earlier this month, new Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre announced the appointment of the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow, 53, publicly defected from Al-Shabaab in August 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5 million bounty for his capture.  The Horn of Africa nation has been mired in chaos since the fall of the military regime of President Siad Barre in 1991.  His ouster was followed by a civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.  The deadliest attack in Somalia occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in a bustling commercial district of Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  As well as the grinding jihadist insurgency, Somalia is also in the grip of a devastating drought that has driven one million people from their homes and left the country in the shadow of famine, according to the United Nations.  nur-txw/yad",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Rushdie was rushed by helicopter to hospital and taken into surgery, his agent Andrew Wylie said in a statement, pledging to provide an update on his condition as soon as possible.  Social media footage showed people administering emergency medical care onstage immediately after the attack. The interviewer also suffered a head injury.  A suspect was taken into custody by police, who gave no immediate details about his identity or probable motive.  The attack occurred at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo city.  Carl LeVan, an American University politics professor attending the event, told AFP that the morning session was about to begin when the suspect ran onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and ""stabbed him repeatedly and viciously.""  LeVan, a Chautauqua regular, said the suspect ""was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued,"" adding that he believed the man ""was trying to kill"" Rushdie.""  ""There were gasps of horror and panic from the crowd,"" the professor said.  LeVan said witnessing the event had left him ""shaken,"" adding he considered Chautauqua a safe place of creative freedom.  ""To know that this happened here, and to see it -- it was horrific,"" he said. ""What I saw today was the essence of intolerance.""  Another witness, John Stein, told ABC that the assailant ""started stabbing on the right side of the head, of the neck. And there was blood... erupting.  ""People in the audience had gotten up on the stage when they saw this and then grabbed the attacker who still had a knife.""    - A decade in hiding -    Rushdie, 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" brought attention beyond his imagination when it sparked a fatwa, or religious decree, calling for his death by Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of the Prophet Mohammed.  Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practicing Muslims and today identifies as an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head -- which remains today.  He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell his children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.    - An 'essential voice' -    Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"" -- which runs to more than 600 pages -- has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  ""Just hours before the attack, on Friday morning, Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face,"" Nossel said in a statement.   ""Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman, wishing him a full and speedy recovery. We hope and believe fervently that his essential voice cannot and will not be silenced.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Police had failed to stop the underground event, which drew around 2,500 people from Thursday night to two disused warehouses in Lieuron, south of the city of Rennes in Brittany.  But the prosecutors office said police had detained two people, both born in 1998, neither of whom had any previous convictions, as part of efforts to identify the organisers.  They were also carrying out a search at one address and had so far turned up a sum of money that appeared on first analysis to be part of the proceeds from the event, and drugs, said prosecutor Philippe Astruc.  Police had seized the material and had also booked more than 1,200 for a variety of offences, he added.  Such mass gatherings are banned across France to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and a nationwide 8-6 overnight curfew has been in force across the country.   Techno music blared out during the night from the warehouses, which had been transformed into illegal nightclubs for partygoers who had flocked to the site from across France and even from abroad.  The local prefecture said Saturday the music had been switched off and sound systems dismantled after two nights, and the first revellers began leaving the site before dawn.  By 10:15 am it was under the control of police, the local prefecture said.  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a tweet that police had seized a truck, sound equipment and generators from the site of the ""illegal rave party"".  The large police presence at the site had led to the break-up of the event ""without violence"", he added.  The regional prefect, Emmanuel Berthier, said 800 people had been booked specifically for coronavirus-related offences such as failing to respect the curfew restrictions or wear masks, or for participating in an illegal assembly.  Police had fined several hundred others for use of narcotics, he told reporters.    - 'We had to party' -     Police on access roads were checking all those leaving the site, on foot or in vehicles, using torches to check their eyes for signs of drugs use, an AFP photographer said.  Police reinforcements continued to arrive and close off the site in a calm atmosphere Saturday morning, the photographer said.  ""It's been a year since we could do anything,"" said 24-year-old partygoer Antoine. The salesman was part of a group of five from Brittany that attended the rave.  With drawn faces but with beers still in their hands, the group said they ""had come to celebrate the 31st here because it was a huge party"".  ""We knew what we were risking... we had to party, for a year everything has been stuck,"" said one of the group, a 20-year-old waitress.  Alexis, a 22-year-old baker, said ""at one point you say to yourself 'I am going to force my New Year',""  He added that the rave had even been reported in the New York Times, saying ""it was the biggest party of the year"".    - 'Lives in danger' -    French authorities have been worried about mass rave parties throughout the pandemic, but New Year's Eve was a particular concern.  On Thursday night the police had tried to ""prevent the event but faced fierce hostility from many partygoers"" who set one of their cars on fire and threw bottles and stones, the prefecture said Friday.  First aid workers had distributed hand gel and masks at the event to try and limit the spread of the coronavirus.  The regional health authority in Brittany noted the ""high risk of the spread of Covid-19"" at the event, and called on those who took part to undergo coronavirus tests and self-isolate immediately for seven days.  The prefecture said in a tweet that a testing centre had been set up in a gymnasium in Lieuron.  ""They have put their lives in danger, their health, they must now protect those around them,"" it said.  The French government, facing the threat of a new wave of Covid-19 infections, announced on Friday it was extending its overnight curfew by two hours in 15 regions to help combat the virus, starting it at 6:00 pm instead of 8.

""The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.  ""No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponize or divert energy from the plant,"" he said.  Ukraine earlier said that Zaporizhzhia -- the largest nuclear facility in Europe -- for the first time was severed form its national grid after fighting around the complex.   Patel said that the United States had no indication of abnormal radiation levels and applauded the ""courage and selflessness"" of Ukrainian workers at the plant.   President Joe Biden, in a telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, called for Russia to return full control of the plant and let in UN nuclear inspectors, the White House said.  Bonnie Jenkins, the under secretary of state for arms control, said Moscow -- which invaded Ukraine in February -- bore responsibility for the plant's safety.  ""Their actions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have created a serious risk of a nuclear incident -- a dangerous radiation release -- that could threaten not only the people and environment of Ukraine but also affect neighboring countries and the entire international community,"" Jenkins told reporters.

But an October crisis over a disputed vote saw him sprung from his cell by supporters and a court overturn his sentence for hostage-taking, as local power-brokers lined up to back his overnight leadership bid.  Japarov's rise was so remarkable that it appeared to catch even Kyrgyzstan's key ally Russia off guard and fuelled speculation over the role that organised crime may have played in the high-speed events.  Yet it was also typical of ex-Soviet Central Asia's most volatile country, where political fortunes have often been made in street protests first and only later at the ballot box.  Japarov's election campaign, which packed stadiums across the country despite the threat of the coronavirus, was headlined by banners reading ""Sadyr -- President"".  The same slogan was chanted by supporters who massed in the capital Bishkek and demanded that Sooronbay Jeenbekov step down in Japarov's favour, after a parliamentary election marred by vote-buying allegations.  Jeenbekov assented, citing the need to avoid bloodshed as he became the third Kyrgyz leader to resign during political turbulence since independence from Moscow in 1991.  Japarov became head of state on an interim basis, quitting the post in November to compete in Sunday's vote while installing loyalists in key positions to retain his grip.  Results published on Sunday by the ex-Soviet country's Central Election Commission (CEC) showed Japarov with close to 80 percent of the vote after an automated count.    - Man of the people? -    Japarov, 52, entered Kyrgyzstan's political scene as a lawmaker in 2005, after building up a small oil business in his native eastern Issyk-Kul region.  His star rose under the patronage of then-president Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who appointed him head of the anti-corruption agency in 2008.  But the agency's investigations never touched on the family of Bakiyev -- widely viewed as the main beneficiary of systemic graft at the time.  Bakiyev was overthrown in 2010, in a revolution far more violent than the one that displaced the first post-Soviet president Askar Akayev five years before.  Violence erupted between ethnic Kyrgyz and minority Uzbeks two months later, claiming hundreds of lives.  A nationalist opposition party that included Japarov among its leaders won parliamentary polls later that year, but was shut out of the ruling coalition.   Japarov's political brand then became associated with chaotic rallies against the Canadian operators of Kyrgyzstan's largest gold mine, which contributes up to 10 percent of national output but has been dogged by corruption accusations and environmental concerns.  During one rally in his native province in 2013 the local governor was briefly taken hostage and doused with petrol.  Authorities then opened a criminal case against Japarov, who fled the country.    - Challenges ahead -    Japarov used his exile to make connections among the million-strong Kyrgyz diaspora that works in Russia and Kazakhstan.  When he returned home from neighbouring Kazakhstan in 2017, Japarov was jailed on hostage-taking charges and later sentenced to 11.5 years in prison.  During this time he lost his father and mother, as well as one of his sons, who died in a road accident. He always insisted on his innocence.  Japarov now faces an uphill battle to revamp the pandemic-battered economy of the second-poorest Soviet successor state and make good on pledges to battle corruption and organised crime -- both systemic problems.  Winning the trust of Russia, a key partner that mediated in last year's crisis, could be another challenge.  President Vladimir Putin described the overthrow of the previous government as a ""misfortune"" in October and chided Kyrgyz politicians for attempting to imitate Western democracies during his end of year press-conference.    ""The level of political consciousness, the maturity of institutions is not the same as, say, in France,"" Putin said.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024']

The blaze, blamed on an electrical fault, hit the Abu Sifin church located in the densely populated Imbaba neighbourhood west of the Nile river, part of Giza governorate.  Witnesses described how people rushed into the burning house of worship to rescue those trapped but were soon overwhelmed by the heat and the deadly smoke.   ""Everyone was carrying kids out of the building,"" Ahmed Reda Baioumy, who lives next to the church, told AFP.  ""But the fire was getting bigger and you could only go in once or you would asphyxiate.""  The Egyptian Coptic Church and the health ministry reported 41 dead and 14 injured in the blaze before emergency services said they had brought the blaze under control.  Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi declared on his Facebook page in the morning: ""I have mobilised all state services to ensure that all measures are taken.""   He later said he had ""presented his condolences by phone"" to Coptic Pope Tawadros II, who has been the head of the denomination in Egypt since 2012.  The interior ministry later said that ""forensic evidence revealed that the blaze broke out in an air-conditioning unit on the second floor of the church building"".  Father Farid Fahmy, of another nearby church in Imbaba, told AFP the fire was caused by a short circuit.  ""The power was out and they were using a generator,"" he said. ""When the power came back, it caused an overload.""    - Religious minority -    Copts are the largest Christian community in the Middle East, making up at least 10 million of Egypt's 103 million people.  The minority has suffered attacks and complained of discrimination in the majority Muslim north African country, the Arab world's most populous.  Copts have suffered deadly attacks by Islamist militants, particularly after Sisi overthrew former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, with churches, schools and homes burnt down.   Copts complain they have been left out of key state positions and have deplored restrictive legislation for the construction of churches compared to that of mosques.   Sisi, the first Egyptian president to attend the Coptic Christmas mass every year, recently appointed the first ever Coptic judge to head the Constitutional Court.  Accidental fires are not uncommon in the sprawling megalopolis of Cairo, where millions live in informal settlements.   Egypt, with its often dilapidated and poorly maintained infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.  In March 2021, at least 20 people died in a blaze in a textile factory in an eastern suburb of Cairo.   In 2020, two hospital fires claimed the lives of 14 Covid-19 patients.  sar/sbh/bha/fz     Meta",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113514635']

The deal raises hopes of an imminent cessation of the worst fighting in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the impoverished Palestinian coastal territory.  ""A short while ago the wording of the Egyptian truce agreement was reached,"" senior Islamic Jihad member Mohammad al-Hindi said in a statement.  Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation.  Gaza's health ministry on Sunday evening raised the death toll to 43 including 15 children, with more than 300 people wounded in the Palestinian enclave, which is run by the Islamist group Hamas.  Two Israelis have been injured by shrapnel over the same period, medics reported.  Islamic Jihad's Hindi said the deal ""contains Egypt's commitment to work towards the release of two prisoners, (Bassem) al-Saadi and (Khalil) Awawdeh"".  Saadi, a senior figure in Islamic Jihad's political wing, was recently arrested in the occupied West Bank, while militant Awawdeh is also in Israeli detention.  Earlier in the day, an Egyptian security source said that Israel ""has accepted"" a ceasefire.    - 'Terrifying' -    Buildings in Gaza have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, while Israelis have been forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets.  Nour Abu Sultan, who lives west of Gaza, said earlier Sunday that she was ""awaiting the declaration of the ceasefire on tenterhooks"".  ""We haven't slept for days (due to) heat and shelling and rockets, the sound of aircrafts hovering above us... is terrifying,"" the 29-year-old said.  Dalia Harel, a resident in the Israeli town of Sderot close to the Gaza border, said she was ""disappointed"" at news of a truce despite her five children being ""traumatised"".  ""We're tired of having a military operation every year,"" she said. ""We need our military and political leaders to get it over with once and for all... we're not for war, but we can't go on like this.""  An AFP photographer saw two rockets being intercepted in the centre of Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv on Sunday evening.  Two Islamic Jihad rockets earlier in the day had targeted Jerusalem, but they were shot down by the Israeli army.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.  The Israeli army has said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"".  Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.  ""Every minute we receive injured people,"" he said earlier Sunday.    - Top militants killed -    Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Gaza's northern Jabalia area on Saturday.  An AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the hospital there, including three minors.  ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   The army said it had struck 139 Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing over 600 rockets and mortars, but with more than 100 of those projectiles falling short inside Gaza.  Amid the high tensions, Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.  Some Palestinians shouted ""God is greatest"" in response, and an AFP photographer was briefly detained by Israeli police, but commemorations passed without major incident.  Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation Friday against Islamic Jihad, which it said was planning an imminent attack.  The army has killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south.  In southern and central Israel, civilians were forced into air raid shelters. Two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others lightly hurt while running for safety, the Magen David Adom emergency service said.  bur-pjm-rsc/lg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Japan's meteorological agency said the quake hit at 11.08pm (1408GMT) at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific, off Fukushima -- near the epicentre of a 2011 killer quake which triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000.

Dominating the news cycle for New York traders was the confirmation hearing of Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee to lead the Treasury, who fielded questions from senators on the incoming administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal.  Investors apparently liked what they heard, with the Dow gaining 0.4 percent and the tech-rich Nasdaq climbing 1.5 percent.  Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axi, said the uptick reflects ""the market giving the Biden policy agenda an early stamp of approval"" a day before his administration takes office.  Oil prices gained on optimism of a global economic recovery and vaccine rollouts that are offsetting concerns about the emergence of new coronavirus strains, while the dollar was mixed.    - Yellen's remarks -    Biden has vowed swift action to get the world's largest economy back on its feet, though he will have to get the stimulus package -- one of two bills he has promised American voters -- through a Congress only narrowly controlled by his Democrats.  At her hearing, Yellen warned that without more stimulus, the United States could be in for renewed economic pain.  She also emphasized that the dollar's value should be determined by foreign exchange markets, and expressed support for digital tax negotiations taking place under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  A global agreement would allow the US to collect taxes from corporations that have moved their headquarters overseas, Yellen said.  ""It would enable us to collect a fair share from corporations, while maintaining the competitiveness of our businesses and diminish the incentives that American companies now have to offshore activities,"" she said.

The country's election commission announced that with 91.1 percent of polling stations reporting results, Museveni had 58.8 percent of votes, while former popstar Bobi Wine had 34.5 percent.  Final results are expected by Saturday afternoon.  Wine, 38, meanwhile was on track to see his newly formed National Unity Platform (NUP) become the main opposition party in Parliament, notably winning eight of nine constituencies in the capital Kampala.  The poll followed one of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and the deaths of at least 54 people.  Thursday's election took place in apparent calm, but under the oppressive presence of soldiers and riot police and an internet blackout which has now entered its fourth day.  However Wine has alleged widespread fraud such as ballot box stuffing and said his party agents had in some places been beaten and chased away from polling stations.  ""Whatever is being declared is a complete sham, we reject it and we dissociate ourselves with it,"" he said on Friday.  Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, promised to provide video evidence once the internet was restored.   Election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said ""the onus is on candidate Kyagulanyi to show how votes are rigged.""

""We continue to urge restraint and rejection of violence by all actors as Uganda's election results are announced. The immediate and full restoration of Internet connectivity is essential.""

They came inside my compound. I feel threatened,"" said the 38-year-old.

Police have advised people not to go out to celebrate or protest when results are announced citing draconian Covid-19 regulations which have regularly been used to crack down on the opposition.  - 35 years of Museveni -    Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote. He is one of Africa's longest serving leaders.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the median age is 16 and most have known only one president, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  Wine, with his humble origins in a slum and popular songs about economic and social injustice, struck a cord with young people, but observers say the odds were stacked against him with Museveni's powerful grip on the state.  The election took place with no major international observer mission aside from the African Union, with the United States saying too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the vote.  np-fb/lc","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

""If Kyrgyzstan is going to live up to the aspirations of its people for a functioning democracy, fully fair competition on a level playing field is critical. This was not the case here,"" the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said.   However, the organisation said the election and a parallel referendum on government reform were ""generally well organized"".  Results published by the ex-Soviet country's Central Election Commission (CEC) showed populist Sadyr Japarov winning close to 80 percent of the vote after an automated count.  The 52-year-old had been serving jail time on hostage-taking charges until October, when his freed by supporters freed him during mass protests.  CEC data showed his closest competitor, nationalist Adakhan Madumarov, trailing far behind with less than 7 percent.  A referendum held in parallel showed the public strongly preferring presidential rule, which would grant Japarov sweeping powers when a new constitution is put to the people later this year.  With a threadbare economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Kyrgyzstan's next leader is likely to be even more dependent on Russia -- a destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrants -- and neighbouring economic giant China.  Russian President Vladimir Putin was among the first leaders to congratulate Japarov on his victory, noting that further cooperation between the two countries ""meets the fundamental interests of our friendly peoples"" in a telegram Monday.  tol-cr/jbr/jxb","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104045825']"

Reports surfaced this week that Moscow is considering prosecuting Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) under conditions that could amount to war crimes.  ""The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them,"" US State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.   Washington believes ""the Kremlin is attempting to deflect responsibility for President (Vladimir) Putin's war of aggression and distract from overwhelming evidence of the atrocities Russian forces have committed in Ukraine"" since the February invasion, Price said.   ""All members of Ukraine's armed forces, including domestic and foreign volunteers incorporated into the armed forces, are entitled to prisoner of war status if they are captured and must be afforded the treatment and protections commensurate with that status, according to the Geneva Conventions,"" he added.  The statement also called on Moscow to ""comply with its obligations under international law.""  The United Nations voiced similar alarm Tuesday.   ""Under international law, individuals entitled to prisoner of war status have combatant immunity and cannot be prosecuted for having participated in hostilities, or for lawful acts of war committed in the course of the armed conflict, even if such acts would otherwise constitute an offense under domestic law,"" UN human rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva.  She warned there are few details available about the potential for such trials, but that images posted by news outlets and on social media appear to show metal enclosures -- possibly intended to confine the detainees -- being built near a concert hall in Mariupol.  The UN rights office is concerned that prisoners of war have generally been held without access to independent monitors, exposing them to the risk of being tortured to extract a confession, Shamdasani added.  lb/caw/sw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Just hours after Friday's attack at a literary event in western New York state, the British author had undergone emergency surgery for potentially life-threating injuries.  But his condition, while still serious, has since shown clear signs of improvement and he no longer requires assisted breathing.  ""He's off the ventilator, so the road to recovery has begun,"" his agent Andrew Wylie said in a statement. ""It will be long; the injuries are severe, but his condition is headed in the right direction.""  The prize-winning writer -- who spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders called for Rushdie's killing over his portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed in his novel ""The Satanic Verses"" -- was about to be interviewed as part of a lecture series when a man rushed the stage and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and abdomen.  The suspected assailant, 24-year-old Hadi Matar from New Jersey, was wrestled to the ground by staff and other audience members before being taken into police custody.  He was later arraigned in court and pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges.  Rushdie's son said the family was ""extremely relieved"" that his father was breathing unaided and had been able to ""say a few words.""  ""Though his life-changing injuries are severe, his usual feisty and defiant sense of humour remains intact,"" Zafar Rushdie said in a statement.  The event host who was on stage with Rushdie and was also injured in the attack said he initially thought it was a practical joke until he realized his famous guest was bleeding.  ""It was very difficult to understand. It looked like a sort of bad prank and it didn't have any sense of reality. And then, when there was blood behind him, it became real,"" Henry Reese, his face heavily bandaged, told CNN in an interview.    - Questions surround suspect -    Police and prosecutors have provided scant information about Matar's background or the possible motivation behind the attack.  Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.  The 75-year-old Rushdie had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989, when Iran's then-supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer for what he deemed the blasphemous nature of ""The Satanic Verses.""  Rushdie moved to New York two decades ago and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  In an interview given to Germany's Stern magazine days before Friday's attack, he had described how his life had resumed a degree of normality following his relocation from Britain.    - 'Appalled' -    ""Ever since I've been living in America ... really there hasn't been a problem in all that time,"" he said.  The stabbing triggered international outrage from politicians, literary figures and ordinary people.  US President Joe Biden called it a ""vicious"" attack and praised Rushdie for ""his refusal to be intimidated or silenced."" British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled.""  But the attack also drew applause from Islamist hardliners in Iran and Pakistan.  Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

A day before Biden becomes the 46th president, Blinken, his choice for secretary of state, indicated that the new administration will revive agreements with Iran and Russia but described both countries as threats.  ""Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone -- even one as powerful as the US,"" Blinken, a mild-mannered longtime aide to Biden, told his Senate confirmation hearing.  ""We can revitalize our core alliances -- force multipliers of our influence around the world. Together, we are far better positioned to counter threats posed by Russia, Iran, and North Korea and to stand up for democracy and human rights.""  Blinken distanced himself from the outgoing president's needling of allies and denunciations of multilateralism but said that Trump ""was right in taking a tougher approach to China.""  ""I disagree very much with the way he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one.""  Blinken backed the determination Tuesday by the outgoing secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, that China was committing genocide against Uighurs and other mostly Muslim people.  He promised to keep looking at ways to block the import of Chinese products that involve forced labor and preventing the export of technology that could ""further their repression.""  Retired general Lloyd Austin, the nominee to be defense secretary, told his hearing that the rising Asian power ""constitutes a significant and long-term security threat to the United States and to our allies and partners.""  ""I believe that because of its ascent and the scope and scale of its military modernization, China is the top priority,"" he said.  Blinken has previously spoken of finding limited areas for cooperation with China, such as climate change.  But the tough talk came as the Trump administration hailed its campaign against China as a signature achievement.  In a farewell address, Trump said that he ""rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before.""    - Return to diplomacy -    The stepson of a Holocaust survivor who found refuge in the US, Blinken, 58, is known for his even temper and passion on humanitarian causes.  He faced friendly questioning even from most Republicans, indicating he is likely to win quick confirmation in the Senate, where his Democratic Party will gain control Wednesday.  A deputy secretary of state in Barack Obama's presidency, Blinken promised to return to diplomacy including on Iran, where Trump walked out of a nuclear accord and slapped on punishing sanctions.  Biden ""believes that if Iran comes back into compliance, we would too,"" Blinken said.  ""But we would use that as a platform with our allies and partners, who would once again be on the same side with us, to seek a longer and stronger agreement,"" he said.  European powers remain committed to the 2015 accord, under which Iran drastically scaled down its nuclear work -- steps it reversed in protest over Trump's sanctions.  An expanded agreement could address Iran's ""destabilizing activities"" in the region as well as its missiles, Blinken said.  ""Having said that, I think we're a long way from there,"" Blinken said.  Blinken said that Biden would also move quickly to extend the New START treaty on nuclear reduction, the last remaining arms pact with Russia, which expires on February 5.  The Trump administration had unsuccessfully sought to expand New START to bring in China, which has a fast-growing military that remains significantly smaller than those of Russia and the United States.  Blinken did not say for how long Biden would seek an extension. Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed a one-year timeframe but negotiations collapsed as the Trump team insisted that Moscow not develop weapons in the interim.    - Shift on Yemen -    In another shift, Blinken said that he would immediately review Pompeo's designation of Yemen's Huthi rebels as a terrorist group.  ""At least on its surface, it seems to achieve nothing particularly practical in advancing the efforts against the Huthis and to bring them back to the negotiating table while making it even more difficult than it already is to provide humanitarian assistance to people who desperately need it,"" Blinken said.  Pompeo issued the designation that took effect Tuesday despite wide warnings from aid groups that they need to deal with the Iranian-aligned rebels, who effectively control much of Yemen.  Blinken said that Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Trump, bore much of the responsibility for what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

A dozen elite police officers have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the killing of 19 people, including at least 14 Guatemalans, near the US border last month.  They are suspected of being connected to gangs battling for control of lucrative people-smuggling routes to the United States.  ""This case is extreme and unacceptable: people who were in the police but who were really criminals,"" said Maria Elena Morera, president of Common Cause, a non-governmental organization that advocates security reforms.  The victims' bodies were found in a bullet-riddled, burnt-out pickup truck on a rural road in Tamaulipas, one of the states hit hardest by a spiral of drug-fueled bloodshed.  Although the massacre is still under investigation, Morera said that police-linked graft is widespread in Mexico due to inadequate training, poor working conditions and threats from criminals.  ""This makes the police officers corrupt,"" she added.    - Dangerous profession -    According to a 2019 study by Common Cause, Mexican police officers earn an average of $587 per month.  While that is much better than the minimum wage of little more than $200, it can be perilous work.  Last year, 524 police officers were killed, according to the NGO.  One of the most shocking cases of alleged police corruption in Mexico was the disappearance of 43 students who had commandeered buses to travel to a demonstration in 2014.  According to investigators, they were stopped by corrupt police in the state of Guerrero and handed over to a drug cartel, never to be seen again.  The following year federal police killed 42 suspected members of the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel in the town of Tanhuato in Michoacan state.   The National Human Rights Commission alleged that 22 of them were summarily executed.  In September 2019, police in Tamaulipas were accused of killing eight people and staging a cover-up.    -  Out of control? -    Mexican authorities ""have resigned themselves to not controlling the police,"" said Gustavo Fondevila, an expert in criminology at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching think-tank.  For years, the ""tacit agreement"" has been to grant the police resources and autonomy, but in Mexico that ""turns into impunity very easily,"" he warned.  In an effort to solve the problem, governments have repeatedly created new police forces, but with little success.  Since 2006, the military has also been given a greater role in fighting organized crime, which has only led to more violence with 300,000 dead and 80,000 missing since then.  In 2019, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, an avowed anti-corruption crusader, created the militarized National Guard, which he says is already winning ""the respect of the people.""  Indeed, public confidence in the National Guard stands at around 83 percent, compared with nearly 58 percent for state police, the statistical institute INEGI reported in December.  But the rapid training of the new security force and failure to tackle the underlying problems mean that in the long term the National Guard ""will bring exactly the same problems as the police,"" warned Fondevila.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105493039']

United and Japan's two main airlines confirmed they had already suspended operations of 56 planes fitted with the same engine which fell apart mid-flight over Colorado on Saturday.  The US National Transportation and Safety Board is also investigating the incident, in which no one was hurt.   Boeing said similarly fitted planes should be taken out of service until the Federal Aviation Authority had determined an inspection procedure.   ""While the NTSB investigation is ongoing, we recommended suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines,"" the company said.   Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) said they had respectively grounded 13 and 19 planes using PW4000 engines but had avoided flight cancelations by using other aircraft.  The Japanese transport ministry said it had ordered stricter inspections of the engine after a JAL 777 plane flying from Haneda to Naha experienced trouble with ""an engine in the same family"" in December.  United said it had voluntarily removed 24 Boeing 777 planes from service and expected ""only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.""  The FAA had earlier ordered extra inspections of some passenger jets.   Steve Dickson, the head of the regulator, said he had consulted with experts and that some airplanes would ""likely"" be removed from service.  ""I have directed them to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines,"" he said in a statement.  Dickson added that a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades, which were unique to the engine model and only used on 777 planes.   Officials from the FAA were meeting with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives on Sunday evening, he added.    - Fresh blow for Boeing -    Flight UA328 had been headed from Denver to Honolulu when it experienced an engine failure shortly after departure.   Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community.  No one onboard or on the ground was injured.   But the engine failure marks a fresh blow for Boeing after several high-profile aviation accidents.  The manufacturer's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after 346 people died in two crashes -- the 2019 Lion Air disaster in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash the following year.  Investigators said a main cause of both crashes was a faulty flight handling system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.  Boeing was forced to revamp the system and implement new pilot training protocols.  The 737 MAX was a big hit with airlines, becoming Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft until its grounding, which has now been lifted.   After the Covid-19 crisis decimated demand, airlines canceled hundreds of orders for the plane.  wat-to/gle/oho   BOEING    JAPAN AIRLINES    ANA HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Kenyans are praying for a peaceful transition of power after almost a decade under President Uhuru Kenyatta, but concerns about vote-rigging linger in a nation still haunted by previous election disputes that descended into deadly violence.  More than 22 million people are registered to vote in an election taking place against a backdrop of soaring prices for food and fuel, a punishing drought that has left millions hungry, and deep disenchantment with the political elite, particularly among the youth.  Deputy president and erstwhile heir apparent William Ruto, 55, is pitted against Raila Odinga, the 77-year-old veteran opposition leader now backed by his longtime rival Kenyatta after a stunning shift in political allegiances.  Ruto, who portrays himself as the ""hustler-in-chief"" championing the poor, was among the first to vote in his Rift Valley stronghold on what he described as ""D-day"".  ""I am confident that the people of Kenya will make the right choice that will take Kenya to the future,"" he said. ""It is upon all of us to respect the choice of Kenyans and I look forward to a victorious day.""  In Odinga's stronghold in the lakeside city of Kisumu, voters in lines many hundreds of metres long queued in the dark outside polling stations as motorcyclists passed by honking and blowing whistles.  ""I woke up early so that I go and choose my leader who might bring change. I have hope in that,"" Moses Otieno Onam, 29, told AFP.  Polling stations opened from 6:00 am (0300 GMT) and are due to close at 5:00 pm (1400 GMT).  Analysts have in recent days suggested that Odinga, a onetime political prisoner and former prime minister who is making his fifth bid for the top job, could narrowly edge past his younger rival.  But if neither wins more than 50 percent, Kenya would be forced to hold a run-off for the first time in its history.    - Pleas for peaceful vote -    Despite mudslinging on the hustings and widespread disinformation, campaigning passed off largely peacefully in contrast to previous polls.  Pressure is on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to ensure a free and fair vote in all six polls -- for the presidency as well as for senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  But already, the election has run into some hitches, with six IEBC officials arrested Monday and the commission suspending several local polls because of erroneous ballot papers.  Kenya's international partners are keenly watching the vote in a country considered a beacon of stability in a troubled region, with diplomats voicing cautious optimism it will pass off largely violence-free.  Both Odinga and Ruto have called for a peaceful vote, but fears remain that if the losing candidate challenges the outcome -- as widely expected -- the discord could erupt into street fighting.  Security is tight, with more than 150,000 officers being deployed.  The trauma of the 2007 election, which was followed by a horrific bout of politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, still looms large.  And Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result that saw then foe Kenyatta re-elected was met with a heavy-handed police response that left dozens dead.  The Supreme Court ordered a rerun in 2017, citing widespread irregularities.  No presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002, and there will be an anxious wait for this year's results which are not expected for several days.  With neither Ruto nor Odinga belonging to the dominant Kikuyu tribe, which has produced three of the country's four presidents, the election will open a new chapter in Kenya's history.    - 'Life is tough' -    Ruto, who once sold chickens on the roadside, has painted the election as a battle between ordinary ""hustlers"" trying to put food on the table and ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  Some observers say economic pressures could compete with tribal allegiances as the key factor driving voter behaviour in a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.  Lawyers David Mwaure and George Wajackoyah -- an eccentric former spy who wants to legalise marijuana -- are also standing for president but are likely to trail far behind the frontrunners.  If Odinga wins, his running mate Martha Karua would become deputy president, the first woman to hold the post.  The new president will face tricky challenges to get the economy back on its feet, rein in Kenya's mammoth $70 billion debt mountain and tackle the corruption that infects every level of society.  Already hit hard by the Covid pandemic that threw hundreds of thousands out of work, Kenyans are now battling soaring inflation as the war in Ukraine sends prices of basic goods spiralling.  ""It's has become a necessity (to vote) because life has become tough. We need to elect someone to help this economy,"" said unemployed 29-year-old Rolland Kwatsima as he cast his ballot in the Nairobi slum of Kibera.  ho-np/txw/mtp","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

Carolina Darias, who until now has held the regional policy portfolio, will take over as health minister following the departure of Salvador Illa who is standing down to run in Catalonia's regional elections in mid-February.   As part of her role, Darias has been liaising with Spain's 17 regions who are responsible for managing healthcare, meaning she has ""shared the day-to-day"" management of the pandemic"" with Illa, the premier said in announcing the appointment.   In recent months, she and Illa have regularly met with the regional health chiefs and given press conferences.   ""Spain's government will continue treating the health crisis as top priority,"" Sanchez said.  Illa, who took up the post as health minister in January 2020, has won huge visibility for coordinating the fight against the virus, with regular TV appearances to update the nation on the situation.  But the post has also made him a lightning rod for criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic, which has infected more than 2.6 million people and claimed nearly 57,000 lives.  And the timing of his departure to run as the Socialist party's top candidate in the elections in Catalonia as new cases spiral out of control has met with a barrage of criticism from Spain's rightwing opposition.

The US burger chain will ""reopen some restaurants in Kyiv and western Ukraine, where other businesses have safely reopened,"" Paul Pomroy, senior vice president for international operated markets, said in a message to employees.  Pomroy cited requests from the company's Ukrainian employees for the relaunch to signify ""a small but important sense of normalcy"" in the besieged country.  McDonald's suspended its operations in Ukraine on February 24 following the Russian siege of the country.   The company has continued to pay salaries of more than 10,000 employees since then, Pomroy said.  ""Over the next few months, we will begin working with suppliers to get product to restaurants, making the physical properties ready to serve customers, bringing restaurant teams and employees back on site, and implementing enhanced procedures and protocols to support the safety of our people and customers,"" Pomroy said.

""But the main thing is that there is a political decision: Mac is back,"" Kuleba said. ""The return of a great American company is first of all a signal for the international business of the opportunity to work in Ukraine, even in spite of war.""   In May, McDonald's said it would sell its Russia business to Russian businessman Alexander Govor after announcing a complete exit from the country.   McDonald's business in Russia ""is no longer tenable, nor is it consistent with McDonald's values,"" the chain said at the time.

Myanmar's military has clamped down on press freedoms since its coup last year, arresting reporters and photographers as well as revoking broadcasting licences as the country plunged into chaos.  Toru Kubota, who was held while covering a protest in Yangon last week, ""has been charged under section 505 (a) and under immigration law 13-1"", the junta said in a statement.  505 (a) -- a law that criminalises encouraging dissent against the military and carries a maximum three-year jail term -- has been widely used in the crackdown on dissent.  Breaching immigration law 13-1 carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.  Filmmaker Kubota, 26, was detained near an anti-government rally in Yangon along with two Myanmar citizens.  After the charges were filed, he was transferred from police custody to Yangon's Insein prison, a security source told AFP, requesting anonymity.  ""He's in good health and embassy officials have visited him already at the police station where he has been detained.""  According to a profile on FilmFreeway, Kubota has previously made documentaries on Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority and ""refugees and ethnic issues in Myanmar"".  He is the fifth foreign journalist detained in Myanmar, after US citizens Nathan Maung and Danny Fenster, Robert Bociaga of Poland and Yuki Kitazumi of Japan, who were all eventually freed and deported.  Fenster, who was held in May last year as he attempted to leave the country, faced a closed-door trial inside Insein on charges of unlawful association, incitement against the military and breaching visa rules.  He was sentenced to 11 years in prison before being pardoned and deported.    - 'War on journalists' -    ""The regime has declared war on journalists, and 505a is its preferred charge,"" said Richard Horsey of the International Crisis Group.  ""This charge against a Japanese journalist shows the regime is determined to continue stifling objective reporting, whether by local or foreign journalists.""  Japan's foreign ministry said in a statement that its embassy in Myanmar was ""appealing to the Myanmar authorities for the early release of the Japanese man, and will continue to make efforts to gather information and request his early release"".  Tokyo is a top donor to Myanmar and has long-standing relations with the country's military.  The already isolated junta stoked further international outrage last week when it announced the execution of four prisoners, in the country's first use of capital punishment in decades.   ""The situation in Burma has gone from bad to worse,"" United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, using the country's former name, after talks with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.  Blinken met Borrell on the sidelines of a meeting of Southeast Asian foreign ministers in Cambodia, from which Myanmar's top diplomat has been excluded over the junta's failure to open talks with its political opponents.  More than 2,100 people have been killed in the crackdown on dissent in Myanmar and almost 15,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group.

Some 4.2 million people in the US have received initial doses of the two-dose vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna -- far below official predictions of 20 million by the new year.  The president blamed local authorities for the delays, tweeting that ""the vaccines are being delivered to the states by the Federal Government far faster than they can be administered!""  He also claimed that the number of cases and deaths was ""far exaggerated"" because of a ""ridiculous method of determination,"" accusing the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) of a policy of ""When in doubt, call it Covid.""  In response, top US scientist Anthony Fauci said on ABC that ""those are real numbers, real people and real deaths.""  Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who was nominated by Trump, told CNN that he saw no reason to question the numbers from the federal CDC.  More than 13 million vaccine doses have been distributed nationwide, but efforts to vaccinate health workers and vulnerable people have been hampered by logistical problems and overstretched hospitals and clinics.  ""There have been a couple of glitches, that's understandable,"" Fauci said, adding it was a challenge ""trying to get a massive vaccine program started and getting off on the right foot.""  Part of the problem, Adams said, was that ""this virus also occurred in the midst of a surge, and a lot of the local capacity to be able to vaccinate was being used for testing and responding to surges.""  Fauci said he saw ""some little glimmer of hope"" in the fact that 500,000 people are now being inoculated a day, a far better number than when the program started last month, and ""I think we can get there if we really accelerate, get some momentum going.""  Adams said he, too, expects vaccinations to ""rapidly ramp up in the new year.""  Troubling reports have emerged of vaccine going bad due to poor organization, lack of healthcare professionals to administer it or, in one isolated case, sabotage.  Some people have also waited in line for hours only to be turned away.  In Tennessee, elder citizens, some with walkers, were reported standing along a busy highway while waiting for their vaccinations.  Moncef Slaoui, the chief advisor to Operation Warp Speed, the military-led US vaccine effort, told CBS there was an ""assumption"" that states had plans in place to administer the vaccine.  ""We need to improve,"" he said. ""We will do the best we can, as we have done over the last eight months, to make (certain) these vaccines indeed make it into the arms of people.""

""In keeping with my campaign promise, my administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room,"" Biden said in a statement issued less than three months before midterm congressional elections, where the issue is seen as a vote winner for Democrats.  In a speech from the White House later, Biden called the assistance ""a game changer.""  ""All this means people can finally start crawling out of that mountain of debt,"" he said. ""When this happens, the whole economy is better off.""  The proposed debt relief falls far short of some Democrats' goal of securing complete forgiveness, but is opposed by Republicans who argue that shaving any amount from loans is unfair to those who have already spent years saving to pay off their own debts.  There was also immediate debate over whether effectively giving millions of people a cash injection will stoke already rampant inflation.  Jason Furman, formerly the chief economic advisor in Barack Obama's White House, tweeted that ""pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless.""  Biden acknowledged he was ""not going to make everybody happy"" but defended the move as ""economically responsible"" and said studies showed there'd be no ""meaningful effect on inflation.""  The White House was unable to say how much the debt cancellations would cost, explaining that the amount will depend on how many people take up the deal.  At Howard University, a historically Black college, journalism student Amarie Betancourt said, ""If everything goes through, that would be absolutely amazing.""  Noting that Biden had promised student debt relief when he was running for the presidency, Betancourt, 20, said, ""I think that's why a lot of people my age and within my generation voted for him.""    - $1.6 trillion debt -    US colleges can often cost anywhere between $10,000 and $70,000 a year, leaving some graduates with crushing debt as they enter the workforce.   According to government estimates, the average debt for US college students when they graduate is $25,000, a sum many require years or even decades to pay back.  In total, some 45 million borrowers nationwide owe a collective $1.6 trillion, according to the White House.  Government data shows that 21 percent of borrowers eligible for relief are under 25 years old, but that more than a third are 40 or older, with five percent still holding college debt in old age.  Under the relief plan, $10,000 will be cut from all loans owed by people earning a salary of less than $125,000. For students who went to university with need-based government assistance known as Pell grants, the relief will be $20,000.  In all cases, the forgiveness will apply to students or former students who apply, rather than being automatic. The program is also only valid for people whose loans were taken out prior to June 30 of this year.  Meanwhile, a moratorium on loan repayments that was instituted during the Covid-19 pandemic will be extended to the end of the year, with installments restarting on December 31 -- reintroducing a revenue stream that Biden said would help offset the cost of the forgiveness program.  ""It's going to be billions of dollars a month in payments coming into the federal government,"" Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council, told reporters.    - 'Giant step forward' -    The plan was announced after months of consideration in the White House on how to thread the needle on an issue that has bedeviled successive administrations.  Biden has been under heavy pressure for months from the senior Senate Democrat, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and lawmakers from the left of the party to take action.  ""With the flick of a pen, President Biden has taken a giant step forward in addressing the student debt crisis by cancelling significant amounts of student debt for millions of borrowers,"" Schumer said in a joint statement with leading liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren.  ""The positive impacts of this move will be felt by families across the country, particularly in minority communities.""  But Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel called the plan a ""bailout for the wealthy.""  ""As hardworking Americans struggle with soaring costs and a recession, Biden is giving a handout to the rich,"" she said.  ""Biden's bailout unfairly punishes Americans who saved for college or made a different career choice, and voters see right through this short-sighted, poorly veiled vote-buy.""  bur-sms/sw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112811646']

A furious Beijing kicked off its biggest-ever exercises around Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit this week to the self-ruled island.  Ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting in Phnom Penh warned against ""provocative action"".  The situation ""could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers"", the ministers said in a joint statement published Thursday.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is attending the talks along with his US counterpart Antony Blinken, though they are not expected to hold a one-on-one meeting.  At a meeting with ASEAN ministers, Blinken said the United States had contacted China ""at every level of government"" in recent days to call for calm and stability.  ""I hope very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretext to increase its aggressive military activity,"" Blinken said.  ""We and countries around the world believe that escalation serves no one and could have unintended consequences that serve no one's interests including ASEAN members and including China.""  Beijing, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory to one day be reclaimed, by force if necessary, was enraged by the trip by Pelosi -- the highest-profile elected US official to visit the island in 25 years.  It vowed ""punishment"" and state TV said it began military drills, including live-fire exercises, at 0400 GMT in several areas encircling Taiwan.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, also in Phnom Penh, condemned the Chinese response.  ""There is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait. It is normal and routine for legislators from our countries to travel internationally,"" he tweeted.  Kung Phoak, Cambodia's deputy foreign minister and ASEAN spokesman, urged both sides to stabilise the situation.   ""We hope de-escalation happens... and normalcy returns to the Taiwan Strait,"" he told reporters.    - Miscalculation fear -    ASEAN is split between countries with close ties to China, such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, and others that are warier of Beijing and its growing international assertiveness.   But no ASEAN country formally recognises Taiwan and none has shown an appetite for backing Taipei against the communist giant.  The ministers' statement -- which avoided referring to Taiwan by name -- said ASEAN ""stands ready to play a constructive role in facilitating peaceful dialogue"", though it is not clear either side is interested in outside mediation.  While Wang and Blinken are not scheduled to meet bilaterally, they will both attend a meeting Friday of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a 27-member body set up to discuss security issues that also includes Russia and the EU.  Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who will also join the ARF gathering, said the fragile status quo in the Taiwan Strait must be maintained.  ""All parties should consider how they can contribute to de-escalating current tensions,"" Wong told AFP.  ""One of the risks the region is concerned about is the risk of miscalculation.""  Pelosi's visit and the flare-up over Taiwan have overshadowed the ASEAN meeting, which had been due to focus on the bloody crisis in Myanmar.  ASEAN has spearheaded so far fruitless diplomatic efforts to ease the turmoil that has flowed from last year's military coup.

A police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also confirmed the figure to AFP.   The incident took place in Cetinje, some 36 kilometres (22 miles) west of the capital Podgorica, after the shooter was involved in a family dispute, according to RTCG.  The shooter was later killed after firing at police officers, the broadcaster added, with an unspecified number of children believed to be among the victims killed.   In the shooting's wake, Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic called on the country to offer support to the families of the victims, saying the incident was unprecedented in Montenegro's recent history.   ""I invite all the citizens of Montenegro to be with the families of the innocent victims,"" the prime minister wrote in a post on Telegram.   Montenegro is famed for its picturesque beaches, framed by nearby mountains that have long been a draw for tourists.   Cetinje is the site of the country's former royal capital and lies in a mountainous valley that has largely stagnated economically in recent decades.    Residents were left in shock in the shooting's wake.   ""I can't believe that this happened in Cetinje and Montenegro. I do not know what to say, I am speechless. I do not know where this can lead us,"" said Cetinje resident Milorad Mitrovic to RTCG.  The incident comes as the country is in the full throes of its highly anticipated tourism high season following two years of the coronavirus pandemic.   With an unemployment rate of some 18 percent and an average monthly salary of under 520 euros ($614), Montenegro counts on tourism and the appeal of some 300 km of azure coastline to boost its revenues.  Holiday destinations such as Budva and Kotor draw big crowds, the latter appearing on the UNESCO world heritage list.

""In light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, the Donald J.

""As we shared previously, comments will continue to be indefinitely disabled under videos from the channel.""  Trump's access to the social media platforms he has used as a megaphone during his presidency has been largely cut off since a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington DC on January 6.  Operators say the embittered leader could use his accounts to foment more unrest aimed at Biden's inauguration on Wednesday.  YouTube last week suspended Trump's channel ""for at least seven days"" and removed a video for violating its policy against inciting violence, joining other social media platforms in banning his accounts after the deadly Capitol riot.  Facebook suspended Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts following the violent invasion of the US Capitol, which temporarily disrupted the certification of Biden's election victory.  In announcing the suspension, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said Trump used the platform to incite violence and was concerned he would continue to do so.   Twitter went a step further by deleting Trump's account, depriving him of his favorite platform. It was already marking his tweets disputing the election outcome with warnings.  Trump also was hit with suspensions by services like Snapchat and Twitch.   Trump, who has not appeared in public for a week, broke days of silence on Tuesday with a pre-recorded farewell video address uploaded to a White House channel at YouTube.  Trump for the first time asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming Biden administration -- a change of tune from weeks spent persuading his huge number of Republican followers that the Democrat cheated in their election battle.

The supporters of Trump who attacked the US Capitol were ""provoked"" by the president and ""fed lies,"" Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.  Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6 following a speech by the president outside the White House in which he repeated his false claims to have won the election.

In its 30 years of multi-party rule, elections in the East African powerhouse have often produced disputed results and set off deadly violence, with rivals accusing each other of fraud and vote-rigging.  The leading candidates this year -- Deputy President William Ruto and Raila Odinga, the opposition veteran who now enjoys the support of the ruling party -- have both called for peaceful votes.  Here is a look at past crises:     - 1992: First multi-party election turns deadly  -    Daniel arap Moi is elected president in Kenya's first multi-party poll on December 29, 1992, benefitting from deep divisions among opposition figures.  Moi had been in power since 1978 when he took over after the death of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first leader after independence from Britain.  The 1992 vote is marred by violence between Moi's Kalenjin tribe and the Kikuyu tribe to which Kenyatta and much of the Kenyan elite belong. Hundreds of people are killed.    - 2007-2008: Inter-ethnic bloodshed -    Outgoing president Mwai Kibaki is proclaimed winner for a second term on December 27, 2007 but his challenger Raila Odinga says the vote was rigged.  Clashes in the weeks that follow kill more than 1,100 people and force 600,000 from their homes in a country generally seen as a beacon of stability in Africa.  The epicentre of the violence is the Rift Valley, where members of the ethnic Kalenjin and Luo communities, who mainly back Odinga, clash with members of the Kikuyu community, to which Kibaki belongs.  On February 28, 2008, an internationally-brokered power-sharing agreement is signed under which Kibaki keeps his job and Odinga becomes prime minister.  In 2010, the International Criminal Court (ICC) opens a probe for crimes against humanity over the 2007-2008 violence.  Two years later its judges confirm charges against Uhuru Kenyatta, son of Jomo Kenyatta, and William Ruto, members of opposing parties at the time, for their alleged role in the violence  On March 4, 2013, Kenyatta wins the election and a year later he becomes the first sitting president to appear before the ICC.   But the cases against both Kenyatta and Ruto later collapse, with former ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda saying a relentless campaign of victim and witness intimidation made a trial impossible.    - 2017: Election annulled -    Kenyatta beats longtime rival Odinga in the August 2017 presidential election but Odinga rejects the results and claims hackers broke into the electoral commission database.  The announcement of Kenyatta's win sparks days of violent protests in Odinga strongholds.  Odinga takes his complaints to the Supreme Court and, in a shock announcement on September 1, judges declare the results of the poll ""invalid, null and void"" and order a re-run within 60 days.  The annulment is a first for Africa.  Kenyatta is re-elected in October in a vote boycotted by the opposition which is marked by low voter turnout.  Dozens of people die in protests that follow, mainly in clashes with police.  But the two men stun the country in 2018 by shaking hands and declaring a truce, leaving Deputy President Ruto out in the cold.  acm-ang-eab/cb/txw","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

The country is hoping for an orderly transition of power after almost a decade under two-term President Uhuru Kenyatta, but concerns about vote-rigging linger after past election disputes triggered deadly unrest.  Deputy President and erstwhile heir-apparent William Ruto, 55, is running against Raila Odinga, the 77-year-old veteran opposition leader now backed by longtime rival Kenyatta after a stunning shift in allegiances.  Voters lined up well before dawn to cast their ballots in what has been billed as a key test for democracy in a country where ordinary people have become frustrated with political leaders and their failure to deliver on their promises.  By 4:00 pm (1300 GMT), 10 hours after polling began, turnout was at just over 56 percent of the 22 million registered voters, according to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).  Comparable figures for the August 2017 election were not immediately available but overall turnout then reached 78 percent.  Polls were due to close at 5:00 pm (1400 GMT), with some stations reporting sparse turnout as they shut their doors.  Others continued to host queues of waiting voters while polling stations whose opening was delayed will stay open until later.  ""Those of them on the queue, all of them will vote -- no-one will be turned away,"" said Sylvia Amoni, an election officer in a central district of Nairobi.    Many people said they hoped this year's vote would make their lives easier as they struggle to put food on the table amid soaring inflation and a crippling drought.  ""I have come to vote to pick someone who bring change to this country,"" said unemployed 34-year-old Ruth Iminza in the Nairobi slum of Kibera.  ""Everything has gone up including school fees for our children.""    - Hope for fair vote -    Pressure is on the IEBC to ensure a free and fair vote in all six polls -- for the presidency as well as for senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  The IEBC acknowledged that about 200 electronic voter registration devices had failed, out of a total of more than 46,000.    Polling was suspended in Wajir, a county bordering Somalia, after a gunfight left election officials trapped inside an office where ballots were stored, the IEBC said.  Police also fired tear gas after youths blocked a road with burning tyres in western Nakuru county after a local vote was suspended.  No presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002, and there will be an anxious wait for this year's results which are not expected for several days.  Analysts have suggested that Odinga, a onetime political prisoner and former prime minister who is making his fifth stab at the presidency, could edge past his younger rival.  If neither wins more than 50 percent, Kenya will stage a run-off for the first time in its history.  Ruto has painted the election as a battle between ordinary ""hustlers"" and ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  Since neither man belongs to the dominant Kikuyu tribe, which has produced three of the country's four presidents, the election will open a new chapter in Kenya's history.  If Odinga wins, his running mate Martha Karua -- a Kikuyu -- would become deputy president, the first woman to hold the post.    - 'We want peace' -    Kenya's international partners are closely watching the vote in a country deemed a beacon of regional stability.   Both Odinga and Ruto have urged a peaceful election, but fears remain that if the loser challenges the outcome -- as widely expected -- there could be unrest.  Security was tight, with more than 150,000 officers deployed across the country of about 50 million.  The trauma of the 2007 poll, which was followed by politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, runs deep.  Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result that saw then foe Kenyatta re-elected was met with a heavy-handed police response that left dozens dead.  Some observers say economic pressure could vie with tribal allegiance as the big motivator for voters in a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.  The new president will have to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, youth unemployment, a $70-billion debt mountain and entrenched corruption.  But first, he will have to make peace with his opponent, Kenyans say.  ""There should be no violence. Whoever wins, we will support them and the person who fails should support the winner,"" said unemployed Mary Musera, who woke up at 3:00 am to vote in Kibera.  ""We want peace.""","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

""I couldn't see anything, everything was dark. Everybody was shouting 'Get out! Get out!' We all had to try to get out,"" he told reporters.  ""I just pushed and pushed. There were people with fire all over their bodies.""  The Sawang Rojanathammasathan Rescue Foundation said 14 people were killed and around 40 injured.

The owner of Santika was jailed for three years over the blaze, which began when fireworks were set off as a rock band called Burn played on stage.

The rebel push by a group of 12 senators loyal to President Donald Trump to block formal certification of Biden's November victory is all but certain to fail, but has raised tensions on Capitol Hill as lawmakers return to work.   Wednesday's joint session -- paired with a collection of rallies fueled by Trump's refusal to accept defeat -- is certain to be the high point of a fraught week showcasing the deep political divisions roiling the country.  On Sunday, when lawmakers take their seats in the House of Representatives, top Democrat Nancy Pelosi faces a possibly tricky battle for reelection as speaker -- an office that places her only two heartbeats from the presidency.  The 80-year-old Pelosi's Democratic Party holds a slim majority in the 435-seat chamber and she is facing no open challenge, but she will need her caucus to remain firm.  Then on Monday, Trump stages one of his big, boisterous rallies in Georgia to campaign for two Republican candidates in a fiercely fought pair of runoff elections that will determine the balance of power in the Senate.  Republicans hope he can fuel a surge in in-person voting, but the president - who narrowly lost to Biden in Georgia - has fanned confusion by tweeting that the races are ""illegal and invalid.""  The special elections take place Tuesday, with Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler facing Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.   ""Georgia voters have so much power right now,"" Ossoff told a campaign event in the small town of Eatonton on Saturday. ""You have the power to make this happen.""  Victory by Ossoff and Warnock would give Democrats, and Biden, a major boost -- seats would be evenly divided between the parties at 50 each, but incoming Vice President Kamala Harris would wield a tie-breaking vote.  Democrats already control the House.  ""It is a tough battle but within the realm of likelihood that Democrats can win,"" Stacey Abrams, the charismatic former Georgia lawmaker who has emerged as a party leader, told CNN on Sunday.    - Threat of chaos -    Wednesday's vote to certify the November election results, which Biden won handily with 306 Electoral College votes to 232 for Trump, would usually be a dry, pro-forma exercise.  But Trump has infused it with unprecedented drama as he continues to insist, without foundation, that the election was stolen from him, and as scores of Republican lawmakers back his efforts.  ""An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can't let it happen!"" he tweeted. He has urged thousands of his supporters to come to Washington on Wednesday for protests. Similar past events have led to sporadic violence.  Beyond the 12 senators, more than 100 Trump loyalists in the House have vowed to join the last-ditch challenge, thereby forcing both houses of Congress to debate the objections raised before confirming Biden's victory.   With Democrats controlling the House and many Republicans expected to vote to certify Biden's election, the bid seems certain to fail.  The maneuver places Vice President Mike Pence in an awkward position: law requires him, as presiding officer of the Senate, to tally each state's votes and announce the result -- his boss's loss.   On Saturday, Pence's spokesman said he ""welcomes"" efforts ""to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people on Jan. 6th,"" though he opposed a legal bid that sought to allow him to invalidate the result.  The attention-getting initiative has sharply divided Republicans between Trump loyalists and more traditional party members.  Senator Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 presidential candidate, on Saturday dismissed it as ""nonsense,"" saying: ""The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic.""  The move represents a clear defiance of powerful Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who has urged members to respect the Electoral College result.    - Pelosi and the Covid factor -    In the House, while Pelosi is confident she has the votes for reelection, the coronavirus pandemic has become a wild card, leaving the attendance of a handful of members uncertain.  While the House changed its rules in May to allow proxy voting due to the health crisis, that change does not extend to the new Congress, so in-person voting will be required.  One newly elected Republican, 41-year-old Luke Letlow of Louisiana, died recently of Covid-19.  Pelosi, the first woman in US history to serve as House speaker, has signaled that this will be her final turn as speaker and possible her last term in the House.  bur-bbk/sst","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

Several prominent pro-Bolsonaro businessmen including billionaire department store mogul Luciano Hang were targeted by federal police raids Tuesday after a media report said they had discussed a potential coup if the far-right president does not win in Brazil's October elections.  Bolsonaro said the authorities had ""nothing"" on the eight businessmen, and that the investigation was a bid to muzzle his supporters.  ""Brazil is on the road to dictatorship. This is how dictatorships start now. You lose (your freedom) little by little, then one day you look and you're completely tied up,"" he told radio network Jovem Pan.  Hang, the owner of retail chain Havan and a vocal Bolsonaro backer with millions of followers on social media, accused the authorities of censorship, saying his Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok accounts had been blocked.  ""They can take away my social networks, but they'll never shut me up!"" said Hang, who has an estimated fortune of $4.8 billion, according to Forbes, built on an empire of department stores known for displaying giant replicas of the Statue of Liberty out front.  ""Say no to censorship! You could be next,"" he posted Thursday on his Twitter account -- which was blocked for users in Brazil.  News site Metropoles reported last week that a WhatsApp messenger group including Hang and other business leaders had ""openly defended a coup"" if Bolsonaro loses to leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party (PT), who leads in the polls.

Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes, the new head of Brazil's top electoral tribunal and a frequent target of Bolsonaro's attacks, directed federal police to execute search warrants reportedly targeting several of the businessmen.  Moraes also reportedly ordered their social media and bank accounts blocked.  Hang, 59, confirmed he had been targeted.  Other targets reportedly included Meyer Joseph Nigri, chairman and former CEO of property developer Tecnisa; Jose Isaac Peres, founder of shopping mall company Multiplan; and Afranio Barreira Filho, owner of restaurant chain Coco Bambu.

The most severe Gaza violence since a war in May of last year followed days of tensions between Israel and the Islamic Jihad group, which Israel accused of planning attacks.   A five-year-old girl in Gaza was among those killed in the Israeli strikes, according to the health ministry in the blockaded territory controlled since 2007 by Hamas Islamists.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid described the strikes as a ""precise counter-terror operation against an immediate threat"", and announced the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, who he described as Islamic Jihad's second-in-command.    Islamic Jihad said the Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"", before it unleashed an ""initial response"" of more than 100 rockets towards Israel.  It later announced another flurry of rocket fire, as air raid sirens rang out across southern and central Israel and officials in the country's commercial capital Tel Aviv opened the city's bomb shelters.  There were no immediate reports of casualties inside Israel.   The army had initially confirmed at least 70 rocket launches from Gaza, saying 11 had fallen inside the strip, with dozens intercepted and others landing in open areas.     - Escalation, mediation -    Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May. Islamic Jihad is a separate group, but aligned with Hamas.   A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor.   The sides exchanged fire for several days without Hamas joining the fray.   Hamas's moves amid the current violence could prove crucial in determining its severity, with the group facing pressure from some to maintain calm in order to improve economic conditions in the territory.   Gaza City resident Abdullah al-Arayshi said the situation was ""very tense"". ""The country is ravaged. We've had enough of wars. Our generation has lost its future,"" he told AFP.  Hamas said Israel has ""committed a new crime for which it must pay the price"".  The Israeli strikes were ongoing late Friday, targeting what the army described as militant targets across the territory. Gaza's health ministry has confirmed 10 dead along with at least 75 injured.      - Five-year-old girl -    Flames poured out of a building in Gaza City following the first round of strikes, while wounded Palestinians were evacuated by medics.  Gaza's health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among nine people killed.   Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.  US ambassador Tom Nides said Washington ""firmly believes that Israel has a right to protect itself"" and urged all sides to maintain calm.   UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was ""deeply concerned"", warning that the escalation was ""very dangerous"".    - 'Pay the price' -    The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad. The militant group did not launch attacks on Israeli territory after the arrests.  The office of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, which runs the occupied West Bank, said the Israeli military action amounted to a ""dangerous escalation"" and called on the international community to curb Israeli ""aggression.""  The Israeli military banned large gatherings in communities within 80 kilometres (50 miles) of the Gaza frontier until Saturday evening.   The measure follows four days of road closures and other restrictions in the border area.  Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.  Gaza's only power station is at risk of imminent outage due to a lack of fuel supplies through Israel, its manager warned on Thursday.  This week's shutdown of the border area follows a raid by security forces in the northern West Bank district of Jenin.  Israeli forces detained Bassem al-Saadi and another senior member of Islamic Jihad. A 17-year-old member of the group was shot dead by Israeli forces during the raid.  bur-bs/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The 76-year-old Trump supported the release of the search warrant, although he has had a copy of the document for days and could have revealed its contents himself previously.  The search on Monday was believed to be focused on classified papers Trump may have removed from the White House, with one report suggesting they included documents related to nuclear weapons.  The highly unusual move to unseal the search warrant and the receipt listing the property seized by FBI agents was announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland -- the country's top law enforcement officer -- who said he had ""personally approved"" the dramatic raid on Trump's Mar-a-Largo resort home.  The Republican former president and his legal team have until 3:00 pm (1900 GMT) Friday to oppose Garland's court request if they so choose. But in overnight social media posts Trump insisted he was actively encouraging making them public.  ""Release the documents now!"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform, as he slammed the raid on his home as a ""political weaponization of law enforcement.""  Andrew Weissmann, a former Justice Department official, said Garland had ""called Trump's bluff"" by putting the onus on the former president to object or consent to release of the document.   The Justice Department motion to unseal the warrant noted -- and did not dispute -- statements by Trump's representatives that the FBI was seeking presidential records and potential classified material.  According to US media, the search related to potential mishandling of classified documents taken to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left the White House in January 2021.  The Washington Post on Thursday cited anonymous sources close to the investigation as saying classified documents relating to nuclear weapons were among the papers sought by FBI agents during the raid.  Trump himself appeared to deny the claim, posting that the ""nuclear weapons issue is a hoax"" and suggesting the Federal Bureau of Investigation might have been ""planting information"" at his home.     - Political firestorm -    The FBI raid sparked a political firestorm in an already bitterly divided country, and comes as Trump weighs another White House run in 2024.  In a statement on Thursday Trump said his attorneys had been ""cooperating fully"" and ""the government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it.""  Leading Republicans have rallied around Trump, and some members of his party have harshly denounced the Justice Department and FBI, accusing them of partisanship in targeting the ex-president.  Garland criticized what he called ""unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department agents and prosecutors.""  In the hours before Garland's remarks, an armed man tried to storm an FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio in an attack that appeared to be a direct response to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.  The assailant, shot dead by police after exchanges of gunfire and an hours-long standoff, was identified as Ricky Shiffer.  The New York Times said a person posting on Truth Social under that name wrote ""I tried attacking the FBI,"" and said he hoped his actions would serve as a ""call to arms.""  The Justice Department typically does not confirm or deny whether it is investigating someone, and Garland took pains to emphasize the law was being applied fairly to Trump.  ""Faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy,"" he said. ""The rule of law means applying the law evenly without fear or favor.""  In addition to investigations into his business practices, Trump faces legal scrutiny for his efforts to overturn the results of the election and the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.  mlm/cl",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

None were in any doubt about the high stakes involved in this year's presidential poll as the East African country of 50 million people struggles with inflation, corruption and an unemployment crisis.  In Kibera, one of the largest slums in Kenya's capital Nairobi, thousands lined up to cast their ballot, trying to shrug off memories of past disappointments in the hope that this vote would prove lucky for them and ease their hardship.  ""All along we have been doing elections, getting promises but we see no change. I hope this time it will be better,"" George Otieno Henry, a 56-year-old artisan, told AFP.  Around 270 kilometres (170 miles) northwest, the mood in the lakeside city of Kisumu -- the stronghold of presidential candidate Raila Odinga -- was festive, with voters loudly proclaiming their support for the former prime minister and motorcylists honking and blowing whistles.  Clara Otieno Opiyo, a 35-year-old vegetable seller, told AFP she left home before dawn to vote, travelling with her five-year-old boy strapped to her back.  ""I came here at 4am to vote, having a lot of hope and faith, but if my presidential candidate succeeds, my children's schooling will be free, I will find work, and my life will change.""  Others even flew in from abroad, eager to ensure they have a say in choosing Kenya's next leader as well as governors, senators, MPs and other representatives.  Daniel Ouko, a 30-year-old sociology graduate who works in a restaurant in Qatar, flew to his hometown Kisumu from Doha, telling AFP: ""It is worth the money. I couldn't miss the vote.""    - 'Calm and peaceful' -    In the Rift Valley town of Eldoret -- the stomping ground of Deputy President William Ruto, who is locked in a tight race with Odinga -- voters patiently waited in line, swapping colourful ""shuka"" blankets for umbrellas as the sun emerged.  Despite an ugly campaign rife with mudslinging and rigging claims, calm has largely prevailed, including in Kisumu and Eldoret, which saw a horrific eruption of politically motivated inter-ethnic violence after the 2007 elections.  ""This election is different from the others, it's way (more) calm and peaceful. This one is really good,"" Joyce Kosgei, a 52-year-old mother of five, told AFP in the village of Kosachei, where Ruto cast his ballot.  Hussein Kassim, a 35-year-old businessman, shuddered as he recalled witnessing the 2007-2008 clashes in Eldoret as a young man.  ""It is high time Kenya should realise voting is just like any other exercise,"" he told AFP.  ""In every competition, there is a winner and a loser. If your candidate loses, fight another day.""  Even as many sought to cast off the shadow of past violence, rigging fears made a troubling appearance in at least one constituency, where the MP vote was suspended because of incorrect ballot papers.  Around 500 demonstrators protested the suspension in western Kenya's Rongai constituency, blocking a road with burning tyres as police responded with tear gas.  ""There is mischief in all this,"" said tomato seller Peninah Tanui, criticising the ""incompetent"" election commission for the mix-up, in which the names of some candidates were missing from ballot papers.  The election commission earlier cancelled several local polls, including in the port city of Mombasa, due to erroneous ballot papers.    - 'Vote, go home, relax' -    But voting largely passed off peacefully elsewhere, with young and old alike turning up to make their voice heard.  In the town of Kiambu, on the outskirts of Nairobi, a beaming Hellena Nyokabi said she wanted ""to vote for leaders who will protect and support this generation and generations to come"".  As onlookers helped the frail 88-year-old walk out of the polling station, she said: ""I feel good that I have voted. I have never missed (a) vote all my life.""  And in a race that has struggled to attract interest from Kenyans aged under 35, some first-time voters said they were optimistic the process would conclude peacefully.  ""We want to see a new change for the new generation,"" said Ibrahim Ahmed Hussein, a 23-year-old student in Kibera -- an Odinga bastion.  ""I expect people to vote wisely and go back home so as to maintain peace and order,"" he told AFP.  ""Vote, go home and relax.""  bur-amu/txw/ri","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

On Sunday, Israel approved 780 new settler homes in the West Bank ahead of a March general election in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to face a fierce challenge from the right from pro-settler candidate Gideon Saar.  The Israel Land Authority (ILA) confirmed Wednesday that the government had invited tenders for a further 2,112 units in the West Bank and 460 in east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope to make the capital of a future state.  The announcement came after the non-governmental organisation Peace Now reported the move, accusing the government of a ""mad scramble to promote as much settlement activity as possible until the last minutes before the change of the administration in Washington"".  ""By doing so, Netanyahu is signalling to the incoming president that he has no intention of giving the new chapter in US-Israel relations even one day of grace, nor serious thought to how to plausibly resolve our conflict with the Palestinians,"" Peace Now said in a statement.  Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, said the Israeli move was equivalent to a ""race to eliminate what remains of the two-state solution, while posing more and more obstacles to the new US administration.""    - 'Policy of colonisation' -    Neighbouring Jordan condemned the decision.  ""The policy of colonisation... is neither legitimate nor legal,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Dhaifallah Ali al-Fayez.  ""It violates international law and undermines the foundations of peace, as well as efforts to reach a two-state solution,"" he said.  France also condemned the move in a foreign ministry statement that called on the Israeli authorities ""not to implement these decisions"".  The ILA also announced the winners of tenders for the construction of 1,257 housing units in east Jerusalem's Givat Hamatos, next to the mainly Palestinian neighbourhood of Beit Safafa.  Israeli anti-occupation group Ir Amim had appealed against the tender, thereby effectively suspending it.  But a court cancelled the freeze on Tuesday, the group said.  ""The Israeli government has rushed to announce the winners with the aim of presenting the tender as a done deal a mere six hours before"" Biden's inauguration, Ir Amim said in a statement Wednesday.  All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by much of the international community.  But Trump's administration, breaking with decades of US policy, declared in late 2019 that Washington no longer considered settlements as being in breach of international law.    - Netanyahu facing right-wing challenge -    Biden has indicated his administration will restore Washington's pre-Trump policy of opposing settlement expansion.  But on Tuesday his nominee for secretary of state said the incoming administration would not reverse Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  ""The only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,"" Antony Blinken said.  Beyond the change in Washington, experts say Netanyahu also has domestic political reasons for pushing settlement expansion.  Electioneering is intensifying ahead of Israel's March 23 vote, in which the country's longest-serving premier faces a new challenge from Saar, a prominent pro-settler voice who split with Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party late last year.  Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967 and has increasingly expanded the size and number of its settlements there, particularly under Netanyahu's leadership since 2009.  There are currently some 650,000 Jews living in east Jerusalem and the West Bank amid an estimated 3.1 million Palestinians.  Governments around the world see the settlements as one of the biggest obstacles to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  gl-cgo/jjm/lg/dv",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

Israel has said it was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, insisting the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza, a Palestinian enclave.   Health authorities in Gaza, controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said a five-year-old girl was among 13 people killed by the Israeli bombardment, adding that more than 110 others have been wounded.  In Jabalia, in the north of Gaza, Fouad Farajallah was on Saturday surveying what remained of his home, hit by an Israeli strike the day before.  ""I was sitting here on the sofa, with my wife and children, and suddenly it all fell on us,"" he said, surrounded by debris from a partially collapsed roof in a strike he said wounded his wife and son.   Israel's strikes were met with barrages of rockets from the Palestinian side, and cross-border fire continued in both directions on Saturday, stoking fears of a repeat of an 11-day conflict in May 2021 that devastated Gaza.   Daily life in the enclave has come to a standstill, with streets largely deserted and most shops closed. Its sole power station ground to a halt due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings days earlier, according to the electricity distributor.   Civilians on the Israeli side meanwhile repeatedly fled to air shelters, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.     - 'Declaration of war' -    An Israeli military spokesman said its forces were ""preparing for the operation to last a week,"" and told AFP that the army is ""not currently holding ceasefire negotiations"".  Sources within Islamic Jihad ruled out a ceasefire soon, with one saying: ""for the movement the focus is on the battlefield"".   Israel and Islamic Jihad confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key leader of the militant group, in a Friday strike on a building in the west of Gaza city.   Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. It declared that the initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"".  ""Israel isn't interested in a wider conflict in Gaza, but will not shy away from one either,"" Prime Minister Yair Lapid had warned in a nationally televised address on Friday.   Jamal al-Fadi, a political science professor at Gaza's Al-Azhar University, said he expected the violence to end ""within days"".  ""Islamic Jihad is reacting in a limited manner and by doing so is preventing the occupation (Israeli military) from intensifying its airstrikes,"" he told AFP.  Both Islamic Jihad and Hamas are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that episode.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve living conditions in Gaza.  Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, said Hamas currently has an interest in staying on the sidelines as it has recently won more economic aid for Gazans.   ""But if more civilians are killed, then it will feel obligated to respond,"" she told AFP.    - Five-year-old girl -    Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza City's main hospital, said medics are facing ""acute shortages of medical supplies"".   On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among those killed.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said Friday ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  The Gaza strikes followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people it said were members of the group in the occupied West Bank.   Israel has conducted a near relentless wave of often deadly raids inside the West Bank since mid-March in response to lethal attacks on Israeli citizens.   bur-rsc/dwo",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The country is hoping for an orderly transition of power after almost a decade under two-term President Uhuru Kenyatta, but concerns about vote-rigging linger after past election disputes triggered deadly unrest.  Deputy President and erstwhile heir-apparent William Ruto, 55, is running against Raila Odinga, the 77-year-old veteran opposition leader now backed by longtime rival Kenyatta after a stunning shift in allegiances.  Voters lined up well before dawn to cast their ballots in what has been billed as a key test for democracy in a country where citizens have become frustrated with political leaders and their failure to deliver on their promises.  By 4:00 pm (1300 GMT), 10 hours after polling began, turnout was at just over 56 percent of the 22 million registered voters, according to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).  Comparable figures for the August 2017 election were not immediately available, but overall turnout then reached 78 percent.  Polls had largely closed by 10:00 pm (1900 GMT), with some stations reporting sparse turnout as they shut their doors at 5:00 pm, when voting was due to finish.  Polling stations whose opening was delayed were continuing to admit voters, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said in a press briefing, urging Kenyans to be patient as election officials worked late into the night, counting votes.  ""We call for patience among Kenyans as we undertake this rigorous exercise and also endeavour to complete this exercise as soon as possible,"" he said.  No presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002, and there will be an anxious wait for this year's results which are not expected for several days.    - Hope for fair vote -    Pressure is on the IEBC to ensure a free and fair vote in all six polls -- for the presidency as well as for senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  The IEBC acknowledged that about 200 electronic voter registration devices had failed, out of a total of more than 46,000.    Polling was suspended in Wajir, a county bordering Somalia, after a gunfight left election officials trapped inside an office where ballots were stored, the IEBC said.  The suspension of local polls triggered a protest in western Nakuru county, but police said late Tuesday that the country had largely ""remained calm and peaceful with no major incidents to report"".  Many people said they hoped this year's vote would make their lives easier as they struggle to put food on the table amid soaring inflation and a crippling drought.  ""I have come to vote to pick someone who will bring change to this country,"" said unemployed 34-year-old Ruth Iminza in the Nairobi slum of Kibera.  ""Everything has gone up including school fees for our children.""  Analysts have suggested that Odinga, a onetime political prisoner and former prime minister who is making his fifth stab at the presidency, could edge past his younger rival.  If neither wins more than 50 percent, Kenya will stage a run-off for the first time in its history.  Ruto has painted the election as a battle between ordinary ""hustlers"" and ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  Since neither man belongs to the dominant Kikuyu tribe, which has produced three of the country's four presidents, the election will open a new chapter in Kenya's history.  If Odinga wins, his running mate Martha Karua will become deputy president, the first woman to hold the post.    - 'We want peace' -    Kenya's international partners are closely watching the vote in a country deemed a beacon of regional stability.   Both Odinga and Ruto have urged a peaceful election, but fears remain that if the loser challenges the outcome -- as widely expected -- there could be unrest.  Security was tight on Tuesday, with more than 150,000 officers deployed across the country of about 50 million.  The trauma of the 2007 poll, which was followed by politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, runs deep.  Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result was met with a heavy-handed police response that left dozens dead.  Some observers say economic pressure could vie with tribal allegiance as the big motivator for voters in a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.  The new president will have to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, youth unemployment, a $70-billion debt mountain and entrenched corruption.  But first, he will have to make peace with his opponent, Kenyans say.  ""There should be no violence. Whoever wins, we will support them and the person who fails should support the winner,"" said unemployed Mary Musera, who woke up at 3:00 am to vote in Kibera.

The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 went into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport in Jakarta on Saturday afternoon.  A military vessel picked up the plane's signal, and divers recovered wreckage from around 23 metres (75 feet) below the water's surface, the transport ministry said Sunday, citing Indonesia's military chief Hadi Tjahjanto.  It did not specify if the signal was from the downed plane's voice and flight data recorder.  Indonesia's President Joko Widodo expressed his ""deep condolences"", and called on citizens to ""pray together so that victims can be found"".  But the frantic search involving helicopters and a flotilla of warships appeared to offer no hope of finding any survivors.  The search and rescue agency said it had so far collected five body bags with human remains as well as debris from the crash site.  A child's pink clothing, a broken tyre and wheel, life jackets and wreckage from the plane were found, according to authorities and AFP reporters on the scene.  Among the passengers was Beben Sofian, 59, and her husband Dan Razanah, 58.  ""They took a selfie and sent it to their kids before taking off,"" the couple's nephew Hendra told AFP.  All 62 people on board, passengers and crew, were Indonesians, including 10 children, authorities said.    - 'Torn into pieces' -    Flight SJ182 was bound for Pontianak city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  On Saturday night, distraught relatives waited nervously for news at Pontianak airport.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" Yaman Zai said as he sobbed.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  The plane crashed near popular day-trip islands just off the coast.  Data from FlightRadar24 indicated that the airliner reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  The transport minister said Saturday that the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  Poor weather, pilot error or a technical problem with the plane were potential factors, said Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman.  ""But it's way too early to conclude anything,"" he added.  ""After the black box is found we can start putting the puzzle together.""  Sriwijaya Air, which operates flights to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  It did not immediately comment when contacted by AFP again on Sunday.    - Reputation for poor safety -    In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.  That crash -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  The 26-year-old 737 that went down Saturday was not a MAX variant.  ""Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families,"" Boeing said in a statement, adding that it was in contact with the airline.  Indonesia's aviation sector has long had a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an Indonesia AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.  Domestic investigators' final report on that crash said major factors included a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance, and the pilots' inadequate response.  A year later, in 2015, more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/qan   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

The filing contained a list of items removed from Mar-a-Lago, including information about the ""President of France,"" and the warrant to search the palatial estate in Palm Beach.  The Justice Department had asked a federal judge to unseal the search warrant on Friday barring objections from Trump, who is weighing another White House run in 2024.  The 76-year-old Trump said he would not block the release of the warrant -- while complaining that he was the victim of ""unprecedented political weaponization of law enforcement"" by ""radical left Democrats.""  Trump and his lawyers have actually had a copy of the search warrant and the receipt listing the property seized by FBI agents for days -- and they could have revealed the contents previously on their own.  The Wall Street Journal said within the 20 boxes of items carted away by FBI agents were binders of photos, a handwritten note and the grant of clemency made by Trump to Roger Stone, an ally of the former president.  The Washington Post on Thursday cited anonymous sources close to the investigation as saying classified documents relating to nuclear weapons were among the papers sought during the raid.  Trump himself appeared to deny the claim, posting that the ""nuclear weapons issue is a hoax"" and even suggesting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation might have been ""planting information"" at his home.    - 'Personally approved' -    The highly unusual move to unseal the search warrant was announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland -- the country's top law enforcement officer -- who said he had ""personally approved"" the raid on Trump's home.  Garland said Thursday he had asked for the release of the warrant because of ""substantial public interest in this matter,"" giving Trump and his legal team until Friday afternoon to oppose the motion, which they ultimately did not.  Leading Republicans have rallied around Trump and some members of his party have accused the Justice Department and FBI of partisanship in targeting the ex-president.  In an attack that appeared to be a direct response to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, an armed man tried to storm an FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio on Thursday.  The assailant, who was shot dead by police after exchanges of gunfire and an hours-long standoff, reportedly posted on Trump's Truth Social platform that he hoped his actions would serve as a ""call to arms.""  Garland on Thursday criticized what he called ""unfounded attacks"" on the FBI and Justice Department while FBI Director Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee, denounced ""violence and threats against law enforcement.""  The Justice Department typically does not confirm or deny whether it is investigating someone, and Garland took pains to emphasize the law was being applied fairly to Trump.  In a statement on Thursday, Trump said his attorneys had been ""cooperating fully"" and ""the government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it.""  In addition to investigations into his business practices, Trump faces legal scrutiny for his efforts to overturn the results of the November 2020 election, and for the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.  Trump was impeached for a historic second time by the House after the Capitol riot -- he was charged with inciting an insurrection -- but was acquitted by the Senate.  cl/jm/sst",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

The British author of ""The Satanic Verses"", which sparked fury among some Muslims, had to be airlifted to hospital for emergency surgery following the attack.  His agent said in a statement obtained by The New York Times that ""the news is not good.""  ""Salman will likely lose one eye; the nerves in his arm were severed; and his liver was stabbed and damaged,"" said agent Andrew Wylie, who added that Rushdie could not speak.  Carl LeVan, an American University politics professor attending the literary event, told AFP that the assailant had rushed onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and ""stabbed him repeatedly and viciously.""  Several people ran to the stage and took the suspect to the ground before a trooper present at the event arrested him. A doctor in the audience administered medical care until emergency first responders arrived.  New York state police identified the suspected attacker as Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old from Fairfield, New Jersey, adding that he stabbed Rushdie in the neck as well as the abdomen.   The motive for the stabbing remains unclear.  An interviewer onstage, 73-year-old Ralph Henry Reese, suffered a facial injury but has been released from the hospital, police said.   The attack took place at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo city.  ""What many of us witnessed today was a violent expression of hate that shook us to our core,"" the Chautauqua Institution said in a statement.  LeVan, a Chautauqua regular, said the suspect ""was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued,"" adding that he believed the man ""was trying to kill"" Rushdie.  ""There were gasps of horror and panic from the crowd,"" the professor said.    - A decade in hiding -    Rushdie, 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" transformed his life when Iran's first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or religious decree, ordering his killing.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.  Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practicing Muslims and today identifies as an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head -- which remains today.  He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell his even his own children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.  Global leaders voiced anger over the attack on Rushdie, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying the author ""embodied freedom"" and that ""his battle is ours, a universal one.""  British leader Boris Johnson meanwhile said he was ""appalled,"" sending thoughts to Rushdie's loved ones and praising the author for ""exercising a right we should never cease to defend.""  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called it a ""reprehensible attack,"" adding that ""all of us in the Biden-Harris Administration are praying for his speedy recovery.""       - An 'essential voice' -    Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa and other threats failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"" -- which runs to more than 600 pages -- has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  ""Just hours before the attack, on Friday morning, Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face,"" Nossel said in a statement.   ""Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman, wishing him a full and speedy recovery. We hope and believe fervently that his essential voice cannot and will not be silenced.""  bur-mdo/md/ssy/ser   THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

A child was among those killed in the strikes, the enclave's health ministry said, while Israel's military estimated 15 combatants were killed.   The Israeli army said the strikes were part of an operation ""against targets in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad"" group.  Islamic Jihad said Israel had ""started a war against our people"".  ""We collectively must defend ourselves and our people. We will not allow the enemy's policy of undermining the resistance and our national perseverance,"" the group said in a statement.  Flames poured out of a building in Gaza City following an air strike, while wounded Palestinians were evacuated by medics.  Gaza's health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among those killed.  Islamic Jihad said it was mourning ""the great jihadist commander Tayseer al-Jabari 'Abu Mahmud', who was killed in a Zionist assassination in Gaza City"".  An Israeli military spokesman said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  ""We haven't finished yet,"" spokesman Richard Hecht told journalists.  The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, which has a strong presence in Gaza.  Hamas, the militant group which rules Gaza, said Israel has ""committed a new crime for which it must pay the price"".  ""The resistance in all its military arms and factions is united in this struggle and will speak loudly, as we cannot accept the situation as it is... all fronts must open fire on the enemy,"" Hamas said in a statement.  Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid was due to hold talks with Defence Minister Benny Gantz on Friday evening.  ""The Israeli government will not allow terrorist organisations to set the agenda in the Gaza Strip and threaten the citizens of the State of Israel. The security forces will act against the Islamic Jihad terrorists to remove the threat,"" Lapid said.  Islamic Jihad is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by the European Union and the United States.  On Friday afternoon, the Israeli military banned large gatherings in communities within 80 kilometres (50 miles) of the Gaza frontier, until Saturday evening.   The measures follow four days of road closures and other restrictions on movement in the border area.  Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.  Gaza's only power station is at risk of imminent outage due to a lack of fuel supplies through Israel, its manager warned on Thursday.  This week's shutdown of the border area follows a raid by security forces in the northern West Bank district of Jenin.  Israeli forces detained Bassem al-Saadi and another senior member of Islamic Jihad. A 17-year-old member of the group was shot dead by Israeli forces during the raid.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Also hit with US business bans were several other oligarchs believed to be close to Putin, four officials Russia has named to administer occupied territories in Ukraine, and around two dozen high technology institutes and companies, including key state-backed electronics entities.  The US Treasury announced sanctions on Putin associate and billionaire Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev, who owns the Witanhurst estate, the second-largest estate in London after Buckingham Palace.   Guryev is the founder and former deputy chairman of PhosAgro, a major supplier to global fertilizer markets.  He and his son were hit with financial sanctions, which ban US businesses -- including banks with US branches -- from transactions with them, and freeze their assets under US jurisdictions.  The Treasury also blacklisted Guryev's Caribbean-based 81-meter (267 feet) yacht Alfa Nero, which puts it at risk of seizure.  However, the Treasury said Alfa Nero ""has reportedly shut off its location tracking hardware in order to avoid seizure.""  The Treasury also imposed sanctions on Alina Kabaeva, a former Olympic gymnast widely described as Putin's girlfriend, and Natalya Popova, the wife of Kirill Dmitriev, the manager of the Russian government's massive sovereign wealth fund.   The Treasury said Popova works for the technology firm Innopraktika, which is run by one of Putin's daughters.

B'Tselem said it carefully weighed its decision to use the hugely emotive phrase but concluded it was an accurate description of Israel's attitude both to residents of the occupied Palestinian territories and to its own Arab citizens.  ""We cannot avoid the conclusion that it is a regime that is working to advance and cement the supremacy of one group of people -- Jews -- over Palestinians,"" B'Tselem chief Hagai el-Ad told AFP.  ""That is the textbook definition of an apartheid regime."" he added. ""I agree that it is a strong word but we are not using it lightly.""  Israel occupied the West Bank, including Arab east Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War of 1967. Today it is home to at least five million Palestinians defined by the United Nations as living under Israeli occupation.  Arab Israelis -- Palestinians who stayed on their land following the Jewish state's creation in 1948 and their descendants -- make up about 20 percent of Israel's roughly nine million people.  By law they have rights equal to those of Jewish citizens, but they say that in practice they suffer discrimination in employment, housing, policing and other essentials.  ""More than 14 million people, roughly half of them Jews and the other half Palestinians, live between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea under a single rule,"" says B'Tselem's hard-hitting analysis ""This is Apartheid,"" published last week.  Palestinians, including NGOs, routinely use the term originally coined to describe the system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in South Africa until the early 1990s.  But its use by B'Tselem -- an established Israeli organisation founded in the late 1980s -- has brought shock.  Gideon Levy, writing in the left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz at the weekend, called it ""revolutionary"".  ""Get to know it: apartheid. An apartheid state. We live in one, we are part of it,"" he added.  Other Israeli media paid scant attention to the B'Tselem report, contrary to Arab and international media organisations.    - Schools ban -    The B'Tselem document enraged Education Minister Yoav Gallant, of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party.  Straight after its publication, he issued a ban on the organisation giving talks to high school pupils, as it has regularly done in the past along with other civil society groups.  But the following day, the prestigious Hebrew Reali School in the northern city of Haifa defied the edict and around 300 pupils in their senior year took part in a Zoom lecture and discussion with el-Ad.  He said that one of the teenagers asked if B'Tselem was not being extremist.  ""I answered saying these are not extreme statements, this is the reality of oppression of apartheid, that is an extreme reality.""  He said that among key factors in his organisation's position was the passing in 2018 of the so-called Nation-State Law which declared Israel as the ""national home of the Jewish people,"" and removed the status of Arabic as an official language in Israel.  It was slammed by critics as legally downgrading Arabs to second-class citizens.  Another was Netanyahu's US-backed plan last year to annex large swathes of the occupied West Bank, a scheme that was put on hold in a normalisation agreement with the United Arab Emirates announced in August.  ""A threshold has been crossed,"" el-Ad said.    - Message to Biden? -    His group's report was unveiled days before Donald Trump -- a staunch backer of Netanyahu and Israeli settlement in the West Bank -- hands over the White House to Joe Biden.  El-Ad says the timing is a ""coincidence"" but he hopes the ""progressive wing"" of Biden's Democratic Party will nudge the new president, who is committed to promoting human rights, to water down US support for Israel's current policies.  Failing so far to stir broad debate on the issues at home, he hopes that there might be a greater response abroad.  ""Over the past few years there has been a deterioration in discourse which I attribute in large part to international inaction,"" he said.  ""There are more settlements, more apartheid, and no consequences.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

With roughly 75 percent of votes counted, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists captured the most votes but the three separatist parties were set to get 74 seats in the 135-seat assembly which would allow them to continue to govern the wealthy northeastern region.  That is up from 70 seats won in the last election in December 2017, just months after Catalonia's failed secession bid which led to the jailing of several separatist leaders.  The Socialists were set to win 33 seats, up from 17 in the last election when it finished fourth.  But as separatist parties agreed in writing last week not to reach any post-election agreements with Socialist candidate former health minister Salvadore Illa, the party has no path to govern.  Sanchez had hoped the election -- the fifth in the region in a decade -- would end separatist rule in the region which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy.  He fielded Illa as his candidate in the hope that his high profile in the fight against the pandemic would help win votes.  The region is currently governed by a coalition of Catalonia's two main separatist parties -- the hardline JxC and the more moderate ERC -- supported by radical separatist party CUP.  ERC captured 33 seats, JxC got 32 and the CUP captured nine in an election marked by low turnout with strict measures in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus.  dbh-mg/ds/jxb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48838589']

Grief has spread over Sunday's fire among Copts, the Middle East's largest Christian community, which makes up at least 10 million of Muslim-majority Egypt's population of 103 million.  But many other Egyptians have also voiced outrage over the disaster in the now scorched Abu Sifin church, located in the greater Cairo neighbourhood of Imbaba west of the Nile River.  As debate flared on social media, one Twitter user charged that the reportedly slow response time ""is not just negligence, it's complicity"".  ""My cousin's children died,"" video creator Moha El Harra said in a widely shared online livestream after Sunday's blaze, which was blamed on an electrical fault.   ""I'm from the area. I know that the ambulance could have been there in three minutes. It took them an hour and a half.  ""All we want is justice -- for the local ambulance authority, the fire services, civil defence. All of them need to be held to account.""    - Smoke inhalation -    Health Minister Khaled Abd el-Ghaffar had declared Sunday that ""paramedics were informed of the fire at 8:57 am"" and the first ambulance ""arrived at the site at exactly 8:59 am"".  But many challenged this, with eye-witnesses saying it took ""an hour and a half"" for emergency services to arrive.  ""No, the ambulance did not arrive within two minutes,"" one local resident, Mina Masry, told AFP. ""If the ambulance had come on time, they could have rescued people,"" he added, stressing that many lives were lost to smoke inhalation, not burns.  A statement from the public prosecutor's office confirmed that asphyxiation caused all of the 41 deaths as the corpses bore ""no other visible injuries"".   Another local witness, Sayed Tawfik, said that, as the inferno raged, some panicked people inside ""threw themselves out of windows to escape the fire"".   He pointed to a car parked on the street with a deep indentation which he said was ""left by a person who is now lying in the hospital with a broken arm and back"".  Residents said bystanders braved flames and smoke to save children from the burning building.  ""Everyone was carrying kids out of the building,"" said Ahmed Reda Baioumy, who lives next to the church. ""But the fire was getting bigger and you could only go in once or you would asphyxiate.""    - Child victims -    Slow response times of emergency services are not unusual in Egypt, where neighbourhood residents routinely improvise rescue efforts, even within the megalopolis of Cairo.  Smoke detectors and alarms and fire escapes are rare and in many areas, such as Imbaba, warrens of narrow roads make it hard for fire engines to reach disaster sites.  Baioumy, the neighbour, told AFP that firefighters were hampered by the church's location ""on a very narrow street"".  Egypt, with its informal residential areas and often dilapidated infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.  Most recently, a church went up in flames a week ago in the eastern Cairo district of Heliopolis, though no deaths or injuries were reported.  Because the Coptic church fire happened during Sunday mass, when local families flock to the church and its daycare services, children were among the victims.  Though officials have not confirmed how many minors died, AFP correspondents at the funeral Sunday night saw several child-sized coffins.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said the order meant some 777s would ""likely"" be removed from service.   He said he had consulted with his team of aviation safety experts following Saturday's engine failure aboard a Boeing 777 airplane shortly after it took off from Denver.  ""I have directed them to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines,"" Dickson said in a statement released on Twitter.  According to NBC News, federal officials said Japan and South Korea also use planes with the PW4000 engine.   A video shot from inside the aircraft -- which had 231 passengers and 10 crew onboard -- showed the right engine ablaze and wobbling on the wing of the Boeing 777-200, its cover entirely missing as the aircraft returned to Denver airport.  There were no injuries on the plane or on the ground, authorities said.  Dickson said a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades.   ""Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes,"" Dickson said.   He added that FAA officials were meeting with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives Sunday evening.   Flight UA328 had been headed from Denver to Honolulu when it experienced an engine failure shortly after departure.   Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community, including a giant circular piece of metal that landed in someone's yard.  The pilots were able to return safely to Denver -- also known as the Mile High City.  The engine failure comes as a fresh blow for Boeing.   The manufacturer's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after 346 people died in two crashes -- the 2019 Lion Air disaster in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash the following year.  Investigators said a main cause of both crashes was a faulty flight handling system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.  Boeing was forced to revamp the system and implement new pilot training protocols.  The 737 MAX was a big hit with airlines, becoming Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft until its grounding, which has now been lifted.   After the Covid-19 crisis decimated demand, airlines cancelled hundreds of orders for the plane.  wat-to/wat   BOEING    GOL LINHAS AERAS INTELIGENTES    UNITED TECHNOLOGIES    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

She also would be one of the few Treasury secretaries with a background is economics and policy, rather than a career at a Wall Street investment bank.  Two previous pandemic relief bills passed by Congress have helped keep the country from a worse downturn by giving loans and grants to small businesses and expanding unemployment benefits, among other provisions.  But those also caused an explosion in the deficit for the 2020 fiscal year, which jumped more than 200 percent to an all-time high of $3.1 trillion, more than twice the prior record.  While some sectors have seen a steady rebound, there is evidence that the tentative recovery is flagging, with weekly Labor Department data showing the pace of layoffs increasing and the economy losing jobs in December.  Economists also fear that the pandemic will exacerbate inequality in the United States.   Many professional workers have managed to continue their employment by working from home, but service industries have seen mass layoffs as states imposed business restrictions to stop infections, disparities Yellen addresses in her remarks.  ""People worry about a K-shaped recovery but well before Covid-19 infected a single American, we were living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built on wealth while working families fell further and further behind,"" she says.   ""This is especially true for people of color.""  cs/hs",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

But the vote could see a high level of abstentions as Spain battles a third wave of the pandemic.  Regional authorities ramped up restrictions to slow soaring case numbers after the Christmas holidays and while the situation has slightly improved, the figures are still high.  When the polls open at 0800 GMT on Sunday, about 5.5 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballots.  But 35,600 of the 82,000 people assigned to help staff polling stations on the day have asked to be recused, despite pledges they will receive full protective suits.  The regional government has insisted that all necessary health and security measures are in place, providing antigen tests for election workers, as well as spacious, well-ventilated polling stations.   It has accepted only 23,300 of the requests.    - Separatists eye majority -    Turnout for the vote is not expected to exceed 60 percent -- and not just because of the coronavirus pandemic.  The vote has been overshadowed by a bitter split between the separatist factions following the failed 2017 independence bid that sparked Spain's worst political crisis in decades.   The Catalan government has been dominated by separatists since 2015, but Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is hoping this election, the fifth in a decade, could end their rule.  He himself came to lead Spain's government in 2018 thanks in part to support from Catalan separatists. Even today, his minority government relies on them to pass legislation.  But Sanchez has not hidden his desire to remove them from power.  To that end, former health minister Salvador Illa is spearheading the Socialists' bid to unseat the separatists in Sunday's election. Sanchez has even taken part in some electoral meetings himself.  The polls put his PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) neck-and-neck with the pro-independence parties.     - Post-election deal-making -    Even if the PSC comes out on top however, polls suggest none of the parties will win an outright majority of 68 in the 135-seat regional parliament.  And that means the eventual outcome will depend on deal-making.  Forming a government ""will probably be quite challenging"" and prospects of a repeat election cannot be ruled out, says Antonio Barroso, an analyst at political consultancy Teneo.  And while the separatist parties remain deeply divided, polls suggest the hardline JxC -- ""Together for Catalonia"" -- and the more moderate ERC could once again cobble together a ruling majority.  Both this week formally ruled out a coalition with the socialists.  The main question then is which of the two will come out stronger.  In the previous election in December 2017, JxC was ahead, forming a 70-seat coalition with ERC.  Should the tables be turned in ERC's favour, it would likely ease tensions and help the tentative reconciliation Sanchez's government has sought to broker since coming to power.   ""An ERC executive would maintain the current ambiguous approach of criticising Madrid rhetorically but not adopting any unilateral measures,"" said Barroso.  ""In contrast, a government headed by JxC would probably lead to a more confrontational stance.""  dbh-mg/hmw/jj/",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48838589']

Zawahiri's assassination is the biggest blow to Al-Qaeda since US special forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, and calls into question the Taliban's promise not to harbour militant groups.  It was the first known over-the-horizon strike by the US on a target in Afghanistan since Washington withdrew its forces from the country on August 31 last year, days after the Taliban swept back to power.  ""Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said in a sombre televised address, adding he hoped Zawahiri's death would bring ""closure"" to families of the 3,000 people killed in the US on September 11, 2001.  Zawahiri was believed to be the mastermind who steered Al-Qaeda's operations -- including the 9/11 attacks -- as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.  A senior administration official said the 71-year-old Egyptian was on the balcony of a three-storey house in the Afghan capital when targeted with two Hellfire missiles after dawn Sunday.  ""We identified Zawahiri on multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony where he was ultimately struck,"" the official said.   The house is in Sherpur, one of Kabul's most affluent neighbourhoods, with several villas occupied by high-ranking Taliban officials and commanders.  The interior ministry previously denied reports of a drone strike circulating on social media, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in Kabul, causing no casualties.  Early Tuesday, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out.  ""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first,"" he said.  ""The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones.""    - 'Grossly violated' -    Although Biden did not mention the Taliban in his televised address, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""by hosting and sheltering"" Zawahiri, the Islamist group had ""grossly violated the Doha Agreement"" which paved the way for America's withdrawal.  Zabihullah, in turn, accused Washington of breaking the 2020 deal.  ""Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan, and the region,"" he said.  Zawahiri, who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run since the 9/11 attacks.  He took over Al-Qaeda after bin Laden was killed, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.  News of his death comes a month before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the hands of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces for two decades.  Under the Doha deal, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke ties with Al-Qaeda.  ""What we know is that the senior Haqqani Taliban were aware of his presence in Kabul,"" the senior US official said.   Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani also heads the feared Haqqani Network, a brutal subset of the Taliban blamed for some of the worst violence of the past 20 years and which has been described by US officials as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence.  In Sherpur, locals told AFP they long thought the targeted house  -- surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, with green tarpaulin covering the balcony where Zawahiri was believed to have been killed -- was empty.  ""We have not seen anybody living there for almost a year,"" said an employee of a nearby office.  ""It has always been in dark, with not a single bulb lit.""    - Doctor turned jihadist -    Zawahiri lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.  Still, the group is believed to have been degraded since the US invasion of Afghanistan, and the White House official said Zawahiri was ""one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of significance"".  The organisation is ""at a crossroads"", said Soufan Center researcher Colin Clarke.   ""Despite Zawahiri's leadership, which minimised AQ's losses while rebuilding, the group still faces serious challenges going forward. For one, there's the question of who will lead Al-Qaeda after Zawahiri's gone.""  Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.  He became involved with Egypt's radical Islamist community at a young age and published several books which came for many to symbolise the movement.  He left Egypt in the mid-1980s, heading for Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar where the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based.  Thousands of Islamist fighters were flooding into Afghanistan at the time, setting the stage for Zawahiri's first meeting with bin Laden.   In 1998 he became one of five signatories to bin Laden's ""fatwa"" calling for attacks against Americans.  Jihadist monitor SITE said some militants were questioning the veracity of the report he had been killed, while others believed Zawahiri had achieved his desire of ""martyrdom.""   sms-pmh-st-fox/ecl/ssy",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113379121']

But monsoon rains were challenging the search effort, as hundreds of injured overwhelmed the only local hospital still operating in the aftermath of the 6.2-magnitude quake, which struck early Friday.  The tremor triggered panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  Rescuers have been filling body bags with corpses hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province, where a hospital was flattened and a shopping mall lay in ruins.  Others were killed south of the city.  The death toll could still climb.  Excavators, cranes and other heavy equipment were deployed across the devastated seaside city where buildings were reduced to a tangled mass of twisted metal and chunks of concrete, including the regional governor's office.  It was unclear how many people -- dead or alive -- could be still under the debris.  ""We heard a roaring sound and the house started shaking,"" said survivor Jumardi, 50, from a shelter where he and six family members took refuge.  ""All I had in my mind was that I would die...Everyone was panicking.""  Authorities have not given a figure for how many survivors have been rescued.  A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.  Meanwhile, corpses were recovered from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.    - Running low on food, supplies -    Masked doctors treated patients with broken limbs and other injuries at a makeshift medical centre set up outside the only one of the city's hospitals that survived the quake relatively intact.  Among them was Wawan, who was rescued by neighbours after the violent tremor buried him.  The 27-year-old initially didn't want to go into a hospital to treat a broken foot.   ""I was traumatised,"" said the man, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.  ""But people convinced me that the doctors were treating patients outside the building, so I agreed to go.""  Thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with whole families.  They said they were running low on food, blankets and other aid, as emergency supplies were rushed to the hard-hit region.  Many survivors are unable to return to their destroyed homes, or were too scared to go back fearing a tsunami sparked by aftershocks, which are common after strong earthquakes.  ""It's better to take shelter before something worse happens,"" said Mamuju resident Abdul Wahab, from a tent with his wife and four kids, including a baby.  Fearing an outbreak of coronavirus in the crowded camps, authorities were trying to separate high- and lower-risk groups.  ""Covid-19 further complicates (the) emergency response,"" said NGO Project HOPE.  - Disaster-prone -    Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, has been hit by a series of natural disasters this week.  Landslides sparked by torrential rains killed at least 28 in Java island, while dozens are dead or missing after severe flooding pounded another part of Sulawesi and Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo.  Volcano Mount Semeru shot a plume of ash and debris some 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) into the sky Saturday night as bright red lava flowed down its crater. There were no reports of casualties.  Indonesian experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.  In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  And on December 26, 2004, a massive 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including 170,000 in Indonesia -- among the worst recorded disasters in history.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

The incident on the flight out of Denver -- which quickly returned to the airport after part of the engine caught fire and broke off -- prompted United and other airlines to ground planes with the same Pratt & Whitney engine.  While no one was injured in the Denver incident, the episode is the latest setback for Boeing, which only recently resumed deliveries of the long-grounded 737 MAX following two fatal crashes of that plane.  Aviation experts said the incident especially raised questions about Pratt & Whitney and United over engine maintenance.  ""It's nothing like the MAX,"" said Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia. ""After all these years of service it is unlikely to be a design issue with the engine, certainly it is something to do with maintenance.""  The Denver incident followed a Japan Airlines 777 incident in December involving the same type of engine, as well as an engine problem in February 2018 on a United flight.  ""There might be a common theme"" among the three incidents ""but until the investigation is complete, we don't know that,"" said Scott Hamilton of Leeham News, an aviation news site.  Boeing said all 128 of the 777s with Pratt & Whitney engines were grounded following Saturday's emergency landing of United flight 328 to Hawaii.   Of the 128 planes, only 69 were in service while 59 were in storage.  Besides United, which removed 24 planes from service, affected carriers included Japanese carriers, Japan Airlines and All Nippon and South Korean airlines, Asiana and Korean Air.  Egyptian state newspaper Al Ahram reported Monday that national carrier Egyptair is grounding four planes with this type of engine.  British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a temporary ban on jets with Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 series engines from entering UK airspace.    - Engine on fire -    A video shot from inside the United aircraft -- which had 231 passengers and 10 crew on board -- showed the right engine ablaze and wobbling on the wing of the Boeing 777-200.  Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered extra inspections after the incident.   FAA chief Steve Dickson said a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades, which were unique to the model and only used on 777 planes.   Officials from the FAA met with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives on Sunday evening, he added.  The US National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) said a preliminary investigation indicated two fan blades fractured on the number 2 engine on the plan.  ""The airplane sustained minor damage,"" the NTSB said in a statement Sunday. ""The examination and documentation of the airplane is ongoing.""  Pratt & Whitney said it was cooperating with the NTSB probe and ""will continue to work to ensure the safe operation of the fleet.""  (The NTSB said the flight had 229 passengers, but United confirmed there were 231.)  United said Sunday it was removing the aircraft from its schedule, ""and will continue to work closely with regulators to determine any additional steps.""  Japan's transport ministry earlier said it had ordered stricter inspections of engines after a Japan Airlines 777 plane flying from Haneda to Naha experienced trouble with ""an engine in the same family"" in December.    - Navigating industry downturn -    The engine failure is unwelcome news for Boeing, which also faces a fresh investigation in Holland after a Boeing 747-400 cargo plane showered a small town Meerssen with debris injuring two people -- the same day as the Denver incident.  ""We have started a preliminary investigation,"" said Luisa Hubregtse of the Dutch Safety Board, the organisation responsible for looking into aviation incidents.  ""However, at this stage it's too early to draw any conclusions,"" she told AFP.  Boeing only recently resumed deliveries of the 737 MAX following a 20-month global grounding after two tragic crashes killed 346 people.  The MAX began returning to commercial service in late 2020, a time when airline travel remains depressed due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Boeing executives said last month they expect it will take about three years for activity to return to pre-pandemic levels.  Michel Merluzeau, an expert at consultancy AIR, agreed the latest problem did not appear to result from poor plane design by the aerospace giant.  ""It's not really a problem for Boeing,"" he said. ""It's more an issue of maintenance -- how United or Pratt & Whitney is maintaining engines that have been in use for a while.""  Hamilton of Leeham News said the episode ""is an embarrassing headline, but as a practical issue, it will have no impact on Boeing.""  Noting the weak demand for longer-service planes during Covid-19, Hamilton predicted some of the carriers could opt to retire the planes rather than return them to service.   Shares of Boeing fell 2.1 percent to $212.88, while Pratt & Whitney's parent company Raytheon Technologies fell 1.7 percent to $73.00.  United rose 3.5 percent to $49.70, joining other carriers in rallying after a positive note from Deutsche Bank about the industry's prospects amid improving Covid-19 trends.  jum-jmb/hs     BOEING    GOL LINHAS AERAS INTELIGENTES    UNITED TECHNOLOGIES    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Fighters from the Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab stormed the Hayat Hotel in Mogadishu on Friday evening in a hail of gunfire and bomb blasts.  Scores of people were trapped inside but officials said many including children have since been rescued.   Sporadic gunfire and loud explosions could be heard into Saturday afternoon, but details remain difficult to verify in the chaos.  It is the biggest attack in Mogadishu since Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was elected in May after many months of political instability.  Al-Shabaab, which has been waging a deadly insurgency for 15 years against the fragile government in the Horn of Africa nation, has claimed responsibility.   ""We are getting information about five more victims confirmed dead and that makes 13 the overall number of civilians killed by the terrorists,"" security commander Mohamed Abdikadir told AFP.  ""The security forces rescued dozens of civilians including children who were trapped in the building.""  Police officer Ibrahim Duale confirmed that more than 10 people had been killed, but said updated information would be released once the siege had ended.  ""The security forces will announce any moment that the siege is over, it took a long time because of the complexity of the rescue mission,"" Duale told AFP.   The director of Mogadishu's main trauma hospital, Mohamed Abdirahman Jama, said the facility was treating at least 40 people wounded in the hotel attack and a separate mortar strike on another area of the capital.  - Mortar attack injures newly-weds -     Dozens of people gathered outside the four-storey hotel to discover the fate of loved ones.  ""We have been looking for a relative of mine who was trapped inside the hotel, she was confirmed dead together with six other people, two of them I know,"" said an anxious Muudey Ali.  There has been no official comment from the government, although East Africa grouping IGAD and Turkey, which has a military base in Somalia, both issued strong condemnations.   In another incident, a volley of mortar shells hit the seafront neighbourhood of Hamar Jajab, district commissioner Mucawiye Muddey told AFP.  ""Among those critically wounded are a newlywed bride and her groom and a family of three children, a mother and their father,"" he said.  There was no immediate claim for that attack.   Witnesses had reported at least two powerful explosions on Friday as gunmen stormed the hotel, a popular spot for government officials in a bustling area on the airport road.  Police spokesman Abdifatah Adan Hassan had told reporters Friday the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with other gunmen.  Witnesses said a second blast occurred just a few minutes later, inflicting more casualties as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to the scene.  Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website, saying its fighters were carrying out ""random shooting"" inside the hotel.  Its spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio Saturday that its forces were still in control of the building and that they had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  Al-Shabaab fighters have carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office and have also launched launched strikes on the Ethiopia border, raising concerns about a possible new strategy.  Earlier this week, the United States announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since US President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.  - Decades of chaos -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Al-Shabaab was driven out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force, but it still controls swathes of countryside and continues to launch deadly strikes on political, civilian and military targets, with popular hotels and restaurants often hit.  Earlier this month, new Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre announced the appointment of the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow, 53, defected from Al-Shabaab in 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5 million bounty for his capture.  Somalia has been mired in chaos since the fall of president Siad Barre's military regime in 1991.  His ouster was followed by a civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in a bustling commercial district of Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  As well as the insurgency, Somalia is also in the grip of a devastating drought that has driven one million people from their homes and left the country in the shadow of famine, according to the United Nations.  nur-txw/ach",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

In the city's Sukhii Fontan (Dry Fountain) district, a dozen people holding empty canisters chat as they stand in line for drinking water.  Fighting in April put a water pipeline out of service.  The water has started running again but it is salty and the only way to get drinking water now is to go to distribution points set up in each district.  But water is far from the main concern.  ""There was an explosion next to my place recently. It's awful, but the scariest part of it all is that I have adapted,"" said Eva Gudzon, a 35-year-old singer and photographer.   ""I don't sleep at night anymore. I just lie there, waiting for the strikes. It messes with my internal clock, and I still have to take care of my children during the day,"" she said.  Mykolaiv, which lies on an estuary just off the Black Sea, was almost encircled and seized by Russian troops at the beginning of the war.  It was a critical objective for the Russian army, which was hoping to secure a path to Odessa -- Ukraine's largest port -- and eventually seize control of Ukraine's entire Black Sea coast.  To avoid this fate, Ukraine put up a fierce fight and managed to drive Russian forces back.  Russia's grip around Mykolaiv has loosened since then, but the shelling never stopped.  The deadliest one, a strike on the administration's buildings on March 29, killed 37 people, including many city employees.     - 'Keep living their lives' -    The economy is in a shambles too.  The city used to be home to 500,000 people. Now, the port is under Russian blockade, and shipyards are at a standstill.  Some are managing to catch a breath: teenagers, wilfully ignoring the ""swimming is prohibited"" sign, have taken over a deserted yacht-club.   The centre of the city and its restaurants are also surprisingly lively. Most clients are off-duty soldiers like 33-year-old Mykola.  ""It's a sad thing to say, but people are starting to get used to it, they try to keep living their lives like before,"" said Mykola, who comes from Russian-occupied Kherson, where his family still lives.  This alarms Valentyn Raylan, a Red Cross volunteer planning to spend the evening repairing his mother's roof after supervising the day's water distribution.  ""It's dangerous to get used to these strikes. People need to keep going down to shelters,"" Raylan said.  The air-raid sirens regularly blasting up in Mykolaiv are mostly ignored by passers-by, despite explosions reminding them that the frontline is only around 20 kilometres (12 miles) away.  The most dangerous time is at night, when strikes on the city intensify.    - 'Ukraine is suffering' -    Two universities were damaged in July. On August 1, a medical centre was hit, along with a warehouse where about 100 tons of food burned, according to Mykolaiv governor Vitaliy Kim.   But two strikes of August 17 and 19 on Petro Mohyla University, the city's most well-known higher education institution, did not deter its rector from announcing that classes would resume in September, as usual.  Among the victims of the overnight strikes were Ukraine grain tycoon Oleksiy Vadatursky and his wife, who were killed in their home on July 31.  For some, the strikes will never become normal.  Among them is Andrii, a 40-year-old docker whose father was killed along with 11 others in a strike on April 4.  ""When you actually hear an explosion, when you hear sirens, or a roof falling down... it's really something else, it's terrifying,"" Andrii said.  ""People are suffering, the city is suffering, Ukraine is suffering. No one expected this. But we stand firm.""   but-tbm/brw/dt/rox-jj   APRIL",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Firefighters were unable to tackle the blaze directly due to the danger of further blasts, with emergency services setting up a 1,000-metre (3,280-foot) safety zone around the site.   Berlin fire brigade spokesman Thomas Kirstein said the situation was ""under control and there was no danger for Berliners"" but that the fire was expected to last for some time.  Around 250 emergency personnel were deployed to the site.  The army sent in a tank aimed at evacuating munitions at the affected storage site as well as remote-controlled de-mining robots, while drones circled the air to assess the emergency.  Water cannons were also deployed around the safety zone to prevent the fire from spreading.  Berlin mayor Franziska Giffey interrupted her holiday to visit the scene, calling the events ""unprecedented in the post-war history of Berlin"".  Giffey advised Berliners to close their windows but said the danger was minimal as there were no residential buildings within a two-kilometre (1.2-mile) radius and so no need to issue evacuation orders.    - Heatwave -    ""It would be much more difficult if there were residential buildings nearby,"" she said.  Firefighters called to the site in the middle of the night were confronted with intermittent blasts that sent debris flying and hindered their work.   No one has been hurt by the fires, which came as a heatwave enveloped Germany.   Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves around the world more frequent and more intense, which increases the risk of fires.  Police said they were investigating what set off the fire.  The store holds munitions uncovered by police, but also unexploded World War II-era ordnance which is regularly dug up during construction works.  Giffey said local authorities would ""have to think about how to deal with this munitions site in the future and whether such a place is the right one in Berlin"".  Authorities appealed for the public to avoid the forest, popular with both locals and tourists, as several regional rail lines have been halted.    - Forest fires -    But authorities said no firefighting choppers were available as they were already in use to calm forest fires in eastern Germany.  They also said the 1,000-metre safety zone applied to the air, so there was a limit to how useful it would be to drop water on the fire from above.  The German capital is rarely hit by forest fires, even though its 29,000 hectares of forests make it one of the greenest cities in the world.  Brandenburg, the region surrounding Berlin, as well as parts of eastern Germany have for days been battling forest fires.  Temperatures are expected to climb as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) across parts of Germany on Thursday. In Berlin, they are predicted to reach 38C.  Heavy thunderstorms are then due to sweep into the country from the west on Friday, the German weather service said.  A cold front is predicted to bring temperatures down by more than 10C overnight in western Germany, falling to around 20-25C on Friday.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113443286']

The vote is heavy with consequences for Kansans, who will decide whether to remove the right to terminate a pregnancy from the traditionally conservative state's constitution.  But it is also seen as a test case for abortion rights nationwide, as Republican-dominated legislatures rush to impose strict bans on the procedure following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  As polls closed at 7:00 pm (0000 GMT), Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab said turnout was as high as 50 percent on this primary election day, local media reported, a number usually expected for a general election.  And poll worker Marsha Barrett said some 250 voters had come to a station in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe by noon -- the same number it might see all day in a presidential election.   ""This election is crazy,"" Barrett told AFP. ""People are determined to vote.""  Other states including California and Kentucky are set to vote on the hot-button issue in November, at the same time as Congressional midterm elections in which both Republicans and Democrats hope to use it to mobilize their supporters nationwide.  In Kansas, the ballot centers on a 2019 ruling by the state's supreme court that guarantees access to abortion.   In response, the Republican-dominated state legislature introduced an amendment known as ""Value Them Both"" that would scrap the constitutional right -- with the stated aim of handing regulation of the procedure back to lawmakers.  In the opposing camp, activists see the campaign as a barely masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban -- one state legislator has already introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest or the mother's life.   For Ashley All, spokeswoman for pro-abortion rights campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the amendment would deal a blow to ""personal autonomy.""  But voter Sylvia Brantley, 60, said she voted in favor of the change because she believes ""babies matter, too.""  She said she wants to see more regulations, in the hope that ""Kansas will not be a marketplace for killing babies.""  Activists have complained that the phrasing of the ballot question is counterintuitive and potentially confusing: voting ""Yes"" to the amendment means abortion rights being curbed, while people who wish to keep those rights intact must vote ""No.""     - All eyes on Kansas -    Abortion rights advocates in Kansas are looking nervously to neighboring Oklahoma and Missouri, which are among at least eight states to have passed near-total bans -- the latter making no exceptions for rape or incest -- while Midwestern Indiana adopted its own rigid ban on Saturday.  Voter Chris Ehly, in Prairie Village, said he voted ""no"" because his daughter and wife ""are very adamant about the decision.""  ""I want to respect them,"" he said.   Another Prairie Village voter, who declined to give her name, said she struggled to decide which way to vote.   ""I've gone back and forth the whole time,"" she told AFP, saying she ultimately chose to vote ""no.""  ""I feel like women should have a choice, but I also don't want full-term babies aborted,"" she said.   The outcome in Kansas -- where abortion is currently permitted up to 22 weeks of pregnancy -- could mean a boost or a blow to either side of the highly charged abortion debate.  Kansas leans heavily toward the Republican Party, which favors stricter abortion regulations, but a 2021 survey from Fort Hays State University found that fewer than 20 percent of Kansas respondents agreed that abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest.  caw/to",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113334565']

But the US government had not given up its pursuit of one of the planners of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the heir to Osama bin Laden.  After years of tracking him down, US armed forces fired two Hellfire missiles from a drone flying above the Afghan capital, striking Zawahiri's safe house and killing him, President Joe Biden announced on Monday.  US officials described an operation as meticulously planned as that which killed bin Laden in his Pakistan hideout in 2011.  That the leader of the violent jihadist group was in Afghanistan was not surprising: since the hard-line Islamist Taliban regained control in August, Al-Qaeda has felt more at home, analysts say.   But finding him was still hard.  ""For several years the US government has been aware of a network that we assessed supported Zawahiri,"" a senior administration official told reporters.  But it was only this year that US intelligence learned that his family, his wife, his daughter and her children, had moved to the Afghan capital.   They were careful, the official said, exercising ""longstanding terrorist tradecraft"" to prevent anyone tracking them to the Qaeda leader.  Still, eventually Zawahiri showed up, and never left.  ""We identified Zawahiri on multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony,"" the official said.  An attack plan developed over May and June. The United States constantly monitored the multi-story residence -- just how the official would not say -- to understand the family's pattern of life.    - Detailed safe-house model -    They studied the construction of the home, aiming to hit Zawahiri without threatening the building's structural integrity, to minimize the risk to civilians.  Defense and intelligence officials finalized the plan in June and presented it to Biden in the White House on July 1, using a detailed model of the residence, as was done before the bin Laden raid.   Biden asked detailed questions on the structure, weather issues, and the risk to civilians, the official said.  Finally, on July 25, Biden -- still ill with a bout of Covid-19 -- made the decision.   It took place with key cabinet officials joining the final briefing, echoing the April 28, 2011 White House meeting where president Barack Obama decided to deploy US special operations troops to enter Pakistan and get bin Laden.  At that time Biden was vice president, and he expressed doubts. The risks of things going wrong were high, bin Laden had not been clearly identified, and relations with Pakistan could suffer, he later recalled.  With Zawahiri, however, no US troops would enter the country; Zawahiri was clearly identified; and relations with the Taliban were next to nil.   At the end of the discussion on the 25th, Biden -- as Obama had done 11 years earlier -- asked each participant for their view.  ""All strongly recommended approval of this target,"" and Biden gave the go-ahead, the official said.  The strike involved a US drone, armed with two precision-guided Hellfire missiles, which were launched at 6:18 am Sunday, Kabul time.  Zawahiri was ""killed on the balcony,"" the official said.  The missiles appear not to have been ordinary Hellfires, whose high explosives could have destroyed the home.    - 'Significant blow to Al-Qaeda' -    Apparent photographs of the building show only a few windows on one floor blown out, and the rest intact.  That points to the likely use of a non-explosive version of the Hellfire, the R9X, which deploys a series of knife-like blades from its fuselage and shreds its target but leaves nearby people and objects intact.   The so-called ""flying ginsu"" missile has been used a half-dozen or more times by US forces to kill other jihadist group leaders without hurting bystanders.  The official did not provide details, but expressed strong confidence that Zawahiri had been killed and no others were hurt.   ""Zawahiri's family members were present in other parts of the safe house at the time of the strike and were purposely not targeted and were not harmed,"" he said.  The official said the strike ""deals a significant blow to Al-Qaeda and will degrade the group's ability to operate.""  ""As President Biden has consistently said, we will not allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists who might bring harm to Americans,"" the official said.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113379121']

""We have no intention of going to war, but we are serious about defending the country,"" he said.  Israel, a close US ally, accuses Iran of seeking to build a nuclear bomb, a charge Tehran denies. The Jewish state also frequently targets Iran-backed militant groups in Lebanon, Syria and the Gaza Strip.  Israel's military chief General Aviv Kochavi said Tuesday he had ordered new plans be drawn up this year to counter Iran's nuclear capabilities, in case political leaders decided to target the country.  ""The power to initiate them lies with the political echelon,"" Kochavi stressed. ""However, the offensive options need to be prepared, ready and on the table.""  Iran's Vaezi shot back on Wednesday that ""they are conducting a psychological war.""   Responding to a question on the sidelines of a council of ministers meeting, he charged that Israel has ""practically no plans, no capacity"".  Iran's recent military manoeuvres, testing missiles and drones, Vaezi added, showed that ""our armed forces are trained"" to defend Iran.  Kochavi's remarks came nearly a week after the inauguration of US President Joe Biden, who has signalled he wants to return to dialogue with Iran.  His predecessor Donald Trump had unilaterally withdrawn Washington in 2018 from a nuclear deal Tehran had struck with major world powers.  Biden's team has argued Iran must first return to strict compliance with its nuclear commitments under the deal with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.  Tehran has demanded an ""unconditional"" lifting of punishing sanctions first, and called on Washington to stop seeking to ""extract concessions"".   Israel rejects the original nuclear deal, and Kochavi reiterated its view that ""any agreement that resembles the 2015 agreement is a bad thing, both strategically and operationally"".

The country is hoping for a peaceful transition of power after almost a decade under President Uhuru Kenyatta, but concerns about vote-rigging linger after past election disputes spiralled into bloodshed.  More than 22 million people, about 40 percent of them under 35, are registered to vote in an election held against a backdrop of soaring inflation, a punishing drought and disenchantment with the political elite.  Deputy president and erstwhile heir-apparent William Ruto, 55, is running against Raila Odinga, the 77-year-old veteran opposition leader now backed by longtime rival Kenyatta after a stunning shift in allegiances.  After a vitriolic campaign, voting was generally smooth.  But some incidents of delays in opening polling stations and problems with electronic voter registration equipment were reported.   And in one area in Nakuru county in western Kenya, police fired tear gas after youths blocked a road with burning tyres.    - 'Hope my life will change' -    Ruto was among the first to vote in his Rift Valley stronghold on what he described as ""D-day"".  Odinga, who is known as ""baba"" or father and is making his fifth stab at the presidency, later cast his ballot in the Nairobi slum of Kibera.  In his bastion in the lakeside city of Kisumu, the atmosphere was festive, with motorcylists honking and blowing whistles.  Clara Otieno Opiyo, a 35-year-old vegetable seller who travelled before dawn to vote with her five-year-old boy strapped to her back, said she hoped her vote would ease economic pain for working-class Kenyans like herself.  ""I came here at 4am to vote, having a lot of hope and faith, but if my presidential candidate succeeds, my children's schooling will be free, I will find work, and my life will change.""  Analysts have in recent days suggested that Odinga, a onetime political prisoner and former prime minister could edge past his younger rival.  If neither wins more than 50 percent, Kenya would have to hold a run-off for the first time in its history.    - Tight security -    Pressure is on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to ensure a free and fair vote in all six polls -- for the presidency as well as for senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  On Monday, six IEBC officials were arrested and the commission suspended several local polls because of erroneous ballot papers.  Kenya's international partners are closely watching the vote in a country deemed a beacon of regional stability. Diplomats say they are cautiously optimistic.  Both Odinga and Ruto have urged a peaceful election, but fears remain that if the loser challenges the outcome -- as widely expected -- there could be unrest.  Security is tight, with more than 150,000 officers deployed across the country of about 50 million.  The trauma of the 2007 poll, which was followed by politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, runs deep.  Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result that saw then foe Kenyatta re-elected was met with a heavy-handed police response that left dozens dead.  In a historic first, the Supreme Court annulled the 2017 vote, citing widespread irregularities.  No presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002, and there will be an anxious wait for this year's results which are not expected for several days.  As neither Ruto nor Odinga belong to the dominant Kikuyu tribe, which has produced three of the country's four presidents, the election will open a new chapter in Kenya's history.    - 'New generation' -    Ruto has painted the election as a battle between ordinary ""hustlers"" and ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  Some observers say economic pressure could vie with tribal allegiance as the big motivator for voters in a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.  Lawyers David Mwaure and George Wajackoyah -- an eccentric former spy who wants to legalise marijuana -- are also standing for president but are likely to trail far behind the frontrunners.  If Odinga wins, his running mate Martha Karua would become deputy president, the first woman to hold the post.  The new president will face challenges to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, youth unemployment, a $70-billion debt mountain and entrenched corruption.  Already battered by the Covid pandemic which threw hundreds of thousands out of work, Kenyans are now suffering from the Ukraine war, which has sent prices of basic goods spiralling.  ""Our country is now full of corruption, we want someone to deal with the issue permanently,"" said first-time voter Ibrahim Ahmed Hussein, a 23-year-old student, in Kibera.  ""I am voting so as to choose a leader who will change this country totally.

The overnight strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine also injured 11 people, with five reported to be in a serious condition.  ""It was a terrible night, regional governor Valentin Reznichenko wrote on Telegram, urging residents to shelter when they hear air raid sirens.  ""I am asking and begging you... Don't let the Russians kill you,"" he wrote, adding that Russia had fired a total of 80 rockets at the area.  Most of the casualties were in the town of Marganets, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest.  Regional council head Mykola Lukashuk said the strikes had hit a local power line, leaving thousands of people without electricity.  Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of recent shelling around the plant itself.  Ukraine says Russia has stationed hundreds of troops and stored ammunition at the plant.  The tensions have brought back memories of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in then Soviet Ukraine, which killed hundreds of people and spread radioactive contamination over much of Europe.  The plant was captured by Russian troops on March 4 after a battle with Ukrainian forces.    - Beachgoers fleeing -    The strikes came a day after major blasts at the Saki airfield, a key military base on the Russian-annexed Crimea peninsula.  Dramatic amateur footage on social media appeared to show panicked holidaymakers fleeing a Crimean beach with young children, as ballooning clouds of grey smoke rose over the horizon.  Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has used the region as a staging ground for its attacks, but it has rarely been a target for Ukrainian forces.  Moscow insisted that the explosions were caused by detonating ammunition rather than Ukrainian fire.  Ukraine's army, which for months pleaded for long-range artillery from Western allies, has been hitting targets deeper in Russian-held territory since some started arriving in recent weeks.   Kyiv has also taken credit for several acts of sabotage inside Russian-held territory.    - New buyer for Ukraine grain? -    The war has severely hampered grain supply from Ukraine, leading to an international food crisis as it is one of the world's biggest producers.  But some ships have been able to leave Ukrainian ports in recent days after a deal with Russia brokered by the United Nations and Turkey.  The first grain shipment to leave on the Sierra Leone-flagged vessel Razoni departed the Ukrainian port of Odessa on August 1 and had been expected to dock in the Lebanese port of Tripoli at the weekend.  But the Ukrainian embassy said a new buyer for the shipment was being sought after the original Lebanese buyer cancelled the order.  A five-month delay after Russia's invasion ""prompted the buyer and the shipping agent to reach agreement on the cancellation of the order,"" the Ukraine embassy said in a statement late Tuesday.

""The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy,"" Timmons said.    - 'Coup' attempt -    Without referring to the assault on the Capitol, Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted ""Violence is always unacceptable. We must respect our constitution and democratic process.""  The attack saw flag-waving Trump supporters break down barricades outside the Capitol and swarm its halls, sending sessions of the House and Senate into an emergency recess.  That interrupted the effort some lawmakers from Trump's Republican party to mount a quixotic attempt to delay certification of Biden's win.  Extraordinary images showed armed security personnel barricading the chamber with weapons drawn while lawmakers huddled inside wearing gas masks.  Labor leader Richard Trumka, president of the powerful AFL-CIO, called the unrest ""one of the greatest assaults on our democracy since the Civil War"" from 1861 to 1865.  ""Today's attempted coup has been years in the making as Donald Trump consistently spews venom, conspiracies, hate and lies to his supporters,"" he said in a statement.  While avoiding Trump's name, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said ""our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transfer of power.""   Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat, said he was ""disgusted"" by the attack, but ""While these scenes are very difficult to watch, I have faith in our Democratic process, and know that the important work of Congress will continue and that people will be held accountable for their actions.""  Arvind Krishan, chairman and CEO of technology giant IBM, said the company ""condemns today's unprecedented lawlessness and we call for it to end immediately. These actions have no place in our society, and they must stop so our system of democracy can work.""  cs/hs","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104705419', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104717056']"

In 2019, the US signed Asylum Cooperation Agreements (ACAs) with the members of the so-called  Northern Triangle of Central America -- El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- as part of its policy to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants across its southern border.  The ACAs allow foreign migrants who request asylum at the US border -- the majority fleeing violence and poverty -- to be sent to await the outcome of their application in those Central American nations.  ""The Trump administration views the ACAs as a model to be replicated with other countries around the world,"" said the document written by the Democratic staff of the Foreign Relations Committee and commissioned by incoming Committee Chairman Bob Menendez.  ""This is precisely the opposite of what needs to happen.""  Biden, who will be inaugurated on Wednesday, has promised ""a fair and humane immigration system"" and has pledged aid to tackle the root causes of poverty and violence that drive Central Americans to the US.  The report said that since the implementation of the first ACA more than a year ago, none of the 945 asylum seekers transferred from the US to Guatemala have managed to receive asylum.  It cited ""degrading"" treatment of asylum seekers transferred from the US to Guatemala under the agreement, and said they were ""effectively coerced to return to their home countries of Honduras or El Salvador, where many feared persecution and harm.""  The report urged the rapid suspension of the pacts, to ""restore our leadership in upholding the right to seek asylum and in protecting refugees.""  ""Congress and the Administration must renew our commitment to the protection of refugees and asylum seekers in the post-Trump era,"" said Menendez, who called the ACAs ""disastrous"" and ""shameful"".  The report also accused the White House and Trump's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of using ""coercive tactics"" to force the governments of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to sign the agreements.  The Trump administration resumed suspended financial assistance for the Northern Triangle countries after sealing the pacts.  bur-leg/am/jfx",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

""The Russian military present at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are implementing the program of (Russian operator) Rosatom aimed at connecting the plant to the Crimean electricity grid,"" Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television.  ""To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines.

Thursday's Wall Street session was choppy after all three major indices surged to records on Wednesday in anticipation of an improving economic picture thanks to newly-installed US President Joe Biden's stimulus plan and efforts to bolster the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.  The Nasdaq finished at a second straight record behind strength in Apple, Facebook and other tech shares.   But petroleum-linked shares plummeted following a series of Biden announcements, including moves to cancel the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, freeze a plan to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and rejoin the Paris climate accord.  But early news reports indicating congressional skepticism of Biden's $1.9 trillion fiscal package suggest ""it isn't going to be an easy undertaking to get the fullness of the proposal passed soon,"" said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.  European indices fell after the European Central Bank held back from tweaking its ultra-loose monetary policy, while Lagarde warned the pandemic still poses ""serious risks"" to the eurozone economy.  The latest virus setbacks ""are disrupting economic activity,"" Lagarde said, noting that the services sector was hit especially hard.  ""The intensification of pandemic poses some downside risks to the short-term economic outlook,"" she added.  The euro fell in value against the pound, with the British currency buoyed by the UK's early vaccine rollout, analysts said.  The stronger pound, which briefly hit a 2.5-year high versus the dollar, weighed on London's benchmark FTSE 100 index, especially on multinationals that record substantial earnings in the US currency.   Europe's single currency also gained ground against the dollar, and Lagarde emphasised during a press briefing: ""We are monitoring very carefully exchange rates.""  A stronger euro makes imports cheaper, keeping a lid on consumer prices and inflation, while exports become less competitive, hurting growth prospects.  Earlier in the day, Asian stock markets posted solid gains as Biden prepared to unveil plans on tackling the coronavirus crisis.

""It's just propaganda,"" Fahim Shah, 66, a resident of the Afghan capital, told AFP.  Late Monday, US President Joe Biden announced Zawahiri's assassination, saying ""justice has been delivered"" to the Egyptian with a $25 million bounty on his head.  A senior US official said the 71-year-old was on the balcony of a three-storey house in the upmarket Sherpur neighbourhood when targeted with two Hellfire missiles shortly after dawn Sunday.   ""We have experienced such propaganda in the past and there was never anything in it,"" Shah said.  ""In reality, I don't think he was killed here.""  The Taliban admitted earlier Tuesday that the US had carried out a drone strike, but gave no details of casualties -- and did not name Zawahiri, who was considered a key plotter of the 9/11 attacks on the United States.  On Sunday, the interior ministry had denied reports of a drone strike, but Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Tuesday that was because an investigation was underway.  Kabul resident Abdul Kabir said he heard the strike Sunday morning, but still called on the United States to prove who was killed.  ""They should show to the people and to the world that 'we had hit this man and here is the evidence',"" Kabir said.  ""We think they killed somebody else and announced it was the Al-Qaeda chief... there are many other places he could be hiding -- in Pakistan, or even in Iraq.""  The strike is sure to further sour already bitter relations between Washington and the Taliban, which pledged to stop Afghanistan from being a sanctuary for militants as part of the agreement that led to the US troop withdrawal last year.  University student Mohammad Bilal was another who thought it unlikely Zawahiri had been living in Kabul.  ""This is a terrorist group and I do not think they will send their leader to Afghanistan,"" Bilal said.  ""Leaders of most terrorist groups, including the Taliban, were either living in Pakistan or in the United Arab Emirates when they were in conflict with former Afghan forces,"" he said.  A straw poll, however, found some believers in the capital.  Kabul housewife Freshta, who asked not to be further identified, said she was shocked to learn of Zawahiri's killing.  ""It's so uncomfortable to know that he was living here,"" she said.  A shopkeeper who also asked not to be named said he too wasn't surprised.

""A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.

Trump released the video following growing calls for his removal after his fired-up supporters breached the Capitol Wednesday and sent lawmakers scrambling for safety.

Flight tracking data showed the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport.  Sixty-two passengers and crew were on board, including 10 children, the nation's transport minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, told reporters.  The suspected crash site is near tourist islands just off the coast of Indonesia's sprawling capital.  Sriwijaya Air flight SJ182 was bound for Pontianak on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  Distraught relatives waited nervously for news at the city's airport.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" Yaman Zai said as he sobbed.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby today...How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  The plane took off on Saturday afternoon and a search and rescue operation began with no official results available on Saturday night.  ""We deployed our team, boats and sea riders to the location suspected to be where it went down after losing contact,"" Bambang Suryo Aji, a senior official at the search-and-rescue agency, told reporters after nightfall.    - Sudden plunge -    Data from FlightRadar24 said the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  ""Sriwijaya Air flight #SJ182 lost more than 10,000 feet of altitude in less than one minute, about 4 minutes after departure from Jakarta,"" the tracking agency said on its official Twitter account.  Broadcaster Kompas TV quoted local fishermen as saying they had found debris near islands just off the coast of the capital Jakarta, but it could not be immediately confirmed as having belonged to the missing jet.  Authorities and the airline gave no immediate indication as to why the plane suddenly went down.  But transport minister Sumadi said the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  Among the other passengers was Agus Minari and her husband who were on their way back to Pontianak after visiting her son and attending a funeral in Java, according to her cousin Deni Triady.  ""The family is deeply shocked,"" Triady added.  Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement offering his ""sincere condolences"" over the incident.  The budget airline, which has about 19 Boeing jets that fly to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and a subsequent fatal flight in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  The Boeing jet thought to have crashed Saturday is not a MAX model and was 26 years old, according to authorities.   ""We are aware of media reports from Jakarta, and are closely monitoring the situation,"" the US-based planemaker said in a statement.  ""We are working to gather more information.""  Indonesia's aviation sector has long suffered from a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane crashed with the loss of 162 lives.   Domestic investigators' final report on the AirAsia crash showed a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance and the pilots' inadequate response were major factors in what was supposed to be a routine flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.  A year later, in 2015, more than 140 people, including people on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/jfx   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

The Al-Qaeda-linked group tried to take over the country before being driven out of the capital Mogadishu in 2011 but it remains a potent and deadly force.  Somalia is also grappling with another devastating drought in many areas that has left millions hungry.  - 2011: Al-Shabaab driven from Mogadishu -    Al-Shabaab is routed from Mogadishu by government forces backed by troops from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).  The Islamists retain control over vast rural areas, from which they frequently launch deadly attacks on AU and Somali forces as well as political and civilian targets.  The Horn of Africa reels from terrible drought, and famine in Somalia kills 260,000 people -- half of them children under the age of six.  - 2012: New government -    A new parliament is sworn in, after the adoption of a provisional constitution.  The international community formally recognises the new federal government and extends billions in aid.    Lawmakers elect former academic Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as president. His term is marked by corruption scandals and infighting.  - 2013, 2015: Attacks in Kenya -    Al-Shabaab claims responsibility for an 80-hour siege of Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in 2013, which leaves at least 67 people dead.   The jihadists say the attack was in retaliation for Nairobi's 2011 military intervention in Somalia.   Two years later, they claim an attack on a university in Garissa in eastern Kenya in which 148 people are killed.  - 2017: Deadliest attack -    In February, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, better known as Farmajo, defeats Mohamud's bid for re-election and is chosen as president by MPs tasked by clan elders with picking the country's leader.  In October, a truck packed with explosives blows up in a bustling commercial district in Mogadishu, killing 512 people. Somalia's deadliest attack is blamed on Al-Shabaab.  - 2020: Election chaos -    Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire is ousted by a parliamentary no-confidence vote in July, officially for having failed to organise elections by universal suffrage.  Two months later Mohamed Hussein Roble is appointed in his place and a new election timetable is cobbled together.  In December, US President Donald Trump orders the withdrawal of most of the around 700 US troops stationed in Somalia to help fight Al-Shabaab and other Islamist groups.  - 2021: Political crisis -    On February 7, Farmajo's mandate runs out but the federal government and regional states fail to agree on a mechanism for electing his successor.  In April, parliament extends his mandate by two years, triggering gun battles in Mogadishu.  In May, Farmajo turns to Roble to help defuse the situation by asking him to organise elections.  But relations between the two men sharply deteriorate. In December, Farmajo sacks Roble but the premier refuses to step down, accusing the president of an attempted ""coup"".    - 2022: Elections at last -    In January, Roble and regional leaders strike a deal to wrap up parliamentary elections by February 25 but the vote is delayed several times.  On March 31, the UN Security Council votes for AMISOM to be replaced by ATMIS (AU Transitional Mission in Somalia), with a view to helping Somali forces take primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  The presidential election is set for May 15. Following a marathon three-round vote by lawmakers, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is elected president, becoming the first Somali leader to win a second term.  Shortly afterwards, the US announces it is reestablishing a troop presence in Somalia, and in July and August it reports killing a number of Al-Shabaab fighters in air strikes.  In July, the jihadists attack a military base on the border with Ethiopia and launch incursions into Somalia's western neighbour.  The UN says in August that one million people have been driven from their home by the worst drought in 40 years, with starvation ""haunting the entire country"".   burs/txw/yad",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Hundreds gathered to pay their respects in and around the two Giza churches where clergymen prayed for the victims, according to AFP correspondents.  Pallbearers pushed through crowds of weeping mourners who reached for the coffins, including that of a priest at the church, Father Abdel-Messih Bekhit.  The Egyptian Coptic Church and the health ministry reported 41 dead and 14 injured in the blaze before emergency services brought it under control.

Father Farid Fahmy, of another nearby church, told AFP a short circuit caused the fire.  ""The power was out and they were using a generator,"" he said. ""When the power came back, it caused an overload.""  In the morning, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on his Facebook page that he had ""mobilised all state services"" in response. He later said he had ""presented his condolences by phone"" to Pope Tawadros II, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church.  He also directed the Armed Forces Engineering Authority to ""take over the reconstruction and renovation"" of the church, the presidency said in a statement.    - Religious minority -    Christian communities often complain that reconstruction of churches after devastating fires is marked by long delays and bureaucratic hurdles.  Giza's governor ordered ""urgent aid of 50,000 pounds (around $2,600) for the families of the deceased and 10,000 pounds for the injured"".  The grand imam of Al-Azhar, Egypt's foremost Muslim institution, expressed his condolences for ""the tragic accident"" and affirmed ""the readiness of Al-Azhar hospitals to receive the injured"".  A statement from the office of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered his ""deepest condolences"" to the families of the victims.  Accidental fires are not uncommon in the sprawling megalopolis of Cairo, where millions live in informal settlements.   Baioumy, the neighbour, told AFP that firefighters were hampered by the church's location ""on a very narrow street"".  Egypt, with its often dilapidated and poorly maintained infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.  The Coptic minority has endured attacks and complained of discrimination in the north African country, the Arab world's most populous.  Copts have been targeted in deadly attacks by Islamist militants, particularly after Sisi overthrew former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, with churches, schools and homes burnt down.   Copts also complain they have been left out of key state positions and they have deplored restrictive legislation for the construction and renovation of churches.   Sisi, the first Egyptian president to attend the Coptic Christmas mass every year, in February appointed the first ever Coptic judge to head the Supreme Constitutional Court, the country's highest.  sar/sbh/bha/jsa/st   Meta",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113514635']

Typhoon Ma-on -- which shares a name with a mountain in Hong Kong and translates as ""saddle"" -- was packing wind speeds of up to 110 kilometres (62 miles) per hour on Wednesday evening and lay about 300 kilometres off China's southern coast.  ""Ma-on is expected to be closest to Hong Kong (Thursday) morning and may skirt within about 200 kilometres south-southwest of the territory, posing a considerable threat,"" the Hong Kong Observatory warned.  ""Under the influence of storm surges and an astronomical high tide, low-lying areas may be flooded"".  The observatory declared a T8 warning, which advises people to return home and leads to the cancellation of ferries and classes -- although the city's subway system continues to operate.  The storm is projected to follow a similar path as 2017's Super Typhoon Hato, which killed 10 people in Macau and caused widespread flooding in Hong Kong.   However, Ma-on is expected to be less destructive, meteorologist Leung Wing-mo told local news outlet HK01.  The eye of the storm is currently projected to make landfall around 8am (0000 GMT) Thursday near the coastal city of Yangjiang, some 160 kilometres west of Macau.  Southern China is frequently hit in summer and autumn by typhoons that form in the warm oceans east of the Philippines and then travel west.  While they can cause temporary disruption to cities like Hong Kong and Macau, fatalities have become much less common thanks to stronger building codes and better flood management systems.  The risk of fatalities is generally higher in more rural parts of southern China.  Like much of China, Hong Kong and Macau have been sweating through a heatwave and enduring a sweltering summer.   According to the Hong Kong Observatory, July was Hong Kong's hottest month ever recorded and there has been little let-up so far in August.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113576378']

Voting in Kampala took place under heavy military and police presence, with no reports of violent incidents making their way through the communications shutdown.  Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, having ruled for almost four decades, and his main rival is singer-turned-MP Bobi Wine, 38, whose popularity among a youthful population has rattled the former rebel leader.  After a campaign marred by arrests, bloodshed and harassment of the opposition and journalists, the internet was shut down on the eve of the election, further fuelling fears the vote would not be free and fair.  After polling closed, election agents in the Kololo neighbourhood of Kampala opened ballot boxes onto a black tarpaulin and counted each vote aloud as tallying began.  ""We wish to salute the people of Uganda for turning up in such high numbers to elect their leaders and also for doing so in a peaceful and tranquil manner,"" said elections chief Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama, at the national tallying centre.  He said voting had been suspended in two constituencies to another date, one where someone had stolen a ballot box, and another where the name of a candidate did not match the ballot paper.  Wine said several of his party's polling agents had been arrested, without going into details.  Police spokesman Fred Enanga told AFP there had been ""no major cases of violence reported.""  Soldiers marched in Kamwokya, the crowded Kampala slum where Wine grew up and is hugely popular, while convoys of riot police patrolled the capital.  Museveni voted in his home district of Kiruhura in rural western Uganda, about 250 kilometres (155 miles) from the capital.   ""He is sure of winning, but he will accept the result of the election so long as they are free and fair,"" Don Wanyama, the presidential spokesman, told AFP.  - Delayed voting -  Wine is the strongest of 10 opposition contenders. But Museveni has never lost an election, and most observers expect he and his ruling National Resistance Movement will emerge victorious.  Nevertheless optimism was high in the opposition heartland of Kamwokya.  ""I am here to change the leadership of this nation because for years, they've been telling me they will secure my future. They have not done that,"" said driver Joseph Nsuduga, 30.  Results are expected by Saturday at 4pm.  Wine has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.  - Generation gap -    Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  He has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  But he is still held in high regard by older Ugandans who remember the relative stability and security that Museveni returned to the country.  ""These young people, they want change, but they don't know what Museveni did for us,"" said Faith Florence Nakalembe, 58.  But her children, also standing in line in Kamwokya to vote, desperately want change.  ""For 23 years I have never seen a different president, and I want someone else,"" said her son, 23-year-old student Saad Mukoone, who was throwing his vote behind Wine.  ""Most of the people in government are old, and they don't want to leave.""  - Crackdown -    The runup to polling day was marred by a sustained crackdown on Museveni's rivals and government critics, and unprecedented attacks on the nation's media and human rights defenders.  In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces loyal to Museveni during protests against one of Wine's numerous arrests.  The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  On Tuesday, Museveni announced the suspension of social media networks and messaging services like Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp in response to Facebook closing accounts linked to government officials the tech giant said were spreading misinformation.  str-np-fb/tgb   FACEBOOK    Twitter","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Three bodies have been found and a desperate operation has been launched to rescue about 17 people trapped in a tunnel, the Uttarakhand state police chief said.  The massive burst of water tore through the Dhauliganga river valley, destroying everything in its path, videos taken by terrified residents showed.  ""There was a cloud of dust as the water went by. The ground shook like an earthquake,"" local inhabitant Om Agarwal told Indian TV.   Most of the missing were workers at two power plants that were battered by the deluge, caused by a huge chunk of glacier that slipped off a mountainside further upstream, said the police chief Ashok Kumar.  ""There were 50 workers at Rishi Ganga plant and we have no information about them. Some 150 workers were at Tapovan,"" he added.  ""About 20 are trapped inside a tunnel. We are trying to reach the trapped workers.""  With the main road washed away, the tunnel was filled with mud and rocks and paramilitary rescuers had to climb down a hillside on ropes to get access to the entrance.  Hundreds of troops and paramilitaries along with military helicopters and other aircraft have been sent to the region.    - 'Grim reminder' -    Authorities emptied two dams to stop the flood waters reaching the Ganges at the towns of Rishikesh and Haridwar, where authorities barred people from going near the banks of the sacred river, officials said.  Villages on hillsides overlooking the river were evacuated, but as night fell authorities said the main flood danger had passed.  Scores of social media users captured the disaster, with footage showing the massive burst of water tearing through a narrow valley below the power plant, leaving roads and bridges destroyed in its wake.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was monitoring the relief operation.  ""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone's safety there,"" he said on Twitter.  14 glaciers overlook the river in Nanda Devi national park -- the topic of scientific studies because of growing fears over climate change and deforestation.  ""Avalanches are common phenomena in the catchment area,"" M.P.S. Bisht, director of the Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, told AFP. ""Huge landslides also frequently occur.""  Devastating monsoon floods in Uttarakhand in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of development projects in the state, particularly in isolated areas like those around the Rishi Ganga dam.  Uma Bharti, a former water resources minister, said that she had called for a freeze on hydro electric projects in ""sensitive"" Himalayan areas such as the Ganges and its tributaries when in government.  Vimlendhu Jha, founder of Swechha, an environmental NGO, said the disaster was a ""grim reminder"" of the effects of climate change and the ""haphazard development of roads, railways and power plants in ecologically sensitive areas.""

Russian authorities ramped up pressure on Navalny's aides on the eve of the protests, handing short jail terms and fines to his close associates for violating protest legislation and urging people to take to the streets.

The number of bombings across Afghanistan has declined since the Taliban returned to power last year, but several attacks -- some targeting minority communities -- have rocked the country in recent months, including those claimed by the jihadist Islamic State (IS) group.  No group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday evening's blast at Kabul's Sediqia Mosque, which has an adjoining madrasa.  ""He was my cousin, may God forgive him,"" said one local resident who gave his name as Masiullah, referring to a relative who died in the explosion.  ""One year had passed from his marriage, he was 27 years old... he was a good person.""  Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran said 21 people were killed and 33 others wounded.  Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said it had received 35 patients, including three who died.  ""Most of the injuries were caused by shrapnel and burns. Our surgeons were operating throughout the night. There were nine children among the victims that we received,"" country director Stefano Sozza said in a statement on Thursday.   Local hospitals contacted by AFP said they were not permitted to provide details of casualties they had treated.    - Security challenge -    The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan on Thursday said security was ""deteriorating"" in the country.   ""We deplore yesterday's attack in a Kabul mosque, the latest in a disturbing series of bombings which have killed & injured more than 250 people in recent weeks, the highest monthly number of civilian casualties over the last year,"" said a statement released on Twitter.  Wednesday's explosion comes nearly a week after a suicide bomber killed top Taliban cleric Rahimullah Haqqani, along with his brother, at his madrasa in Kabul.  Haqqani was known for angry speeches against IS, which later claimed the attack.  The jihadist group has primarily targeted minority communities such as Shiites, Sufis and Sikhs.  While IS is a Sunni Islamist group like the Taliban, the two are bitter rivals and greatly diverge on ideological grounds.    - Secretive supreme leader -    The Taliban's secretive supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada condemned the attack on Thursday, according to a statement released by the group.  He had appeared at a men-only gathering of more than 2,500 Taliban officials, Muslim clerics and elders in the southern city of Kandahar -- its de facto power base.   The mass meeting was held to mark the first anniversary of the movement's return to power -- a turbulent year that saw women's rights crushed and a humanitarian crisis worsen.  Afghanistan is in economic crisis, with its overseas assets frozen by Washington and aid curtailed to keep funds out of the Taliban's hands.  Tensions have emerged within the Taliban in recent months over the need for international recognition, with no country yet establishing formal ties with the government.  Akhundzada said the Taliban were ""ready to fight the United States once again"" for the right to implement its harsh interpretation of sharia law, according to the group's statement, in which he also stressed the need for unity.  The reopening of girls' secondary schools in the country has been a major sticking point.  ash-qbd/ecl/dhc","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113551461', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113550033']"

The vote is heavy with consequences for Kansans themselves, who will decide whether to remove the right to terminate a pregnancy from the traditionally conservative state's constitution.  But it is also being seen as a test case for abortion rights nationwide, as Republican-dominated legislatures rush to impose strict bans on the procedure following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Other states including California and Kentucky are set to vote on the issue in November, at the same time as Congressional midterm elections in which both Republicans and Democrats hope to mobilize their supporters nationwide around the question of abortion.  In Kansas, where polling stations opened at 7:00 am (1200 GMT), the ballot centers on a 2019 ruling by the state's supreme court that guarantees access to abortion -- currently up to the 22-week stage of pregnancy.   In response, the Republican-dominated state legislature introduced an amendment known as ""Value Them Both"" that would scrap the constitutional right -- with the stated aim of handing regulation of the procedure back to lawmakers.  In the opposing camp, activists see the campaign as a barely masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban -- one state legislator has already introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother.   For Ashley All, spokeswoman for pro-abortion rights campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the amendment would deal a blow to ""personal autonomy.""  Activists also complain that the phrasing of the ballot question is counterintuitive, and potentially confusing: voting ""Yes"" to the amendment means abortion rights being curbed, while people who wish to keep those rights intact must vote ""No.""     - All eyes on Kansas -    Abortion rights advocates in Kansas are looking nervously to neighboring Oklahoma and Missouri, which are among at least eight states to have passed near-total bans -- the latter making no exceptions for rape or incest -- while Midwestern Indiana adopted its own rigid ban on Saturday.  Kara Miller Karns, a voter in Leawood, Kansas, said she planned to vote for the status quo on Tuesday, saying it was ""not acceptable"" for her daughters to grow up with fewer rights than she did.   But in the same neighborhood, 43-year-old Christine Vasquez said she planned to back the constitutional amendment -- in hope it would clear the way for a future vote on an abortion ban.  ""I believe that life starts at conception,"" she told AFP ahead of the ballot.  The outcome in Kansas could mean a boost or a blow to either side of the highly charged US abortion debate.  Kansas leans heavily toward the Republican Party, which favors stricter abortion regulations, but a 2021 survey from Fort Hays State University found that fewer than 20 percent of Kansas respondents agreed that abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113334565']

But Ken Kohl, a federal prosecutor with the Washington US attorney's office, said they did not expect to charge anyone with ""incitement"" or ""insurrection"" in Wednesday's violence, amid calls for legal action against President Donald Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others for encouraging it.  The department unveiled the cases against 13 people, including Richard Barnett, a Trump supporter who invaded the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Lonnie Coffman of Alabama, who was found carrying two handguns and had 11 Styrofoam-enhanced Molotov cocktails in his truck.  Others whose charges were unsealed include Christopher Albert of Maryland, who allegedly entered the US Capitol with a loaded handgun; and Mark Leffingwell, charged with punching an officer.  Most of the 13 were charged with illegal entry into restricted buildings of Congress, and violent or disorderly conduct.  They were also charged with impeding government functions after forcing the shutdown of a joint meeting of Congress to officially certify that Trump rival Joe Biden had won the November 3 election, which Trump had until Thursday refused to accept.    - 'Lawless destruction' -    Barnett, famously photographed with his feet on a desk in Pelosi's office, was charged with theft of stationery.  ""The lawless destruction of the US Capitol building was an attack against one of our nation's greatest institutions,"" said Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin in a statement.  Kohl said that not all the charges filed over Wednesday's violence had been unsealed, and that more were in the pipeline as the FBI investigates.  ""This investigation has the highest priority,"" he said, with ""hundreds"" of Justice Department investigators working the case.  More charges and arrests were expected.  Around 40 people were arrested and charged by local Washington police, mostly for curfew violations, weapons offenses and unlawful entry.

He said the FBI was not investigating anyone on possible ""incitement"" or ""insurrection"" charges.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, ""hundreds"" of cluster munition attacks by Russian forces have been documented, reported, or are alleged to have occurred, the Cluster Munition Coalition said in an annual report.  ""Russia's extensive use of internationally-banned cluster munitions in Ukraine demonstrates a blatant disregard for human life, humanitarian principles and legal norms,"" the CMC's Mary Wareham said.  This ""terrible development"" is ""unconscionable and deserves condemnation"", she added.  Dropped from planes or fired from artillery, cluster bombs explode in mid-air, scattering bomblets over a wide area. They pose a lasting threat as many fail to explode on impact and effectively act as landmines.  Ukraine is the only country where cluster munitions are currently being deployed, the CMC said in an overview of their use around the world.  Ukrainian forces also appear to have used cluster munitions at least three times, the civil society campaign said.    - 'Devastating number' -    Focusing on the war in Ukraine, the report said there had been a ""devastating number of cluster munition attacks during Russia's invasion"".  Preliminary data indicates at least 689 casualties during the first half of 2022: 215 killed and 474 injured.  Many further casualties may have gone unrecorded, the report said.  The attacks ""mostly affected civilian infrastructure"" and where their status was known, ""all of the casualties in Ukraine were civilians"", said the CMC.  ""While these early reports do not yet represent a full or precise account of the situation, they clearly indicate the extensive and horrendous impact of cluster munitions in Ukraine,"" the report added.  ""The CMC urges Russia to immediately put an end to these indiscriminate attacks,"" it said.    - 'Stigma' -    Russia is continuing to produce cluster munitions and has used at least six types in Ukraine during 2022, including at least two new ones, according to the report.   There is no evidence of Ukraine acquiring cluster munitions from other countries this year, the CMC said.  Neither Russia nor Ukraine have joined the convention prohibiting the use, transfer, production and stockpiling of cluster bombs, which has 110 states parties and 13 other signatories.  The states parties are due to meet from next Tuesday at the United Nations in Geneva.  ""Unequivocally condemning ongoing use of cluster munitions in Ukraine is crucial to strengthen the stigma against these weapons,"" said Wareham.    - Use in 2021 -    Last year, 149 new cluster munition casualties were recorded -- 59 killed and 90 injured -- across nine countries and two other territories, chiefly Syria, Iraq, Laos and Yemen.  Of the casualties, 144 were civilians, while children accounted for 66 percent of all casualties where the age group was known.  The casualties were all caused by remnants of cluster munitions.  The total number was sharply down on the 360 casualties in 2020, and way down on the Syria-dominated 1,117 in 2016.  In total, 26 countries and three other territories are known or thought to have cluster munition contamination.  Laos and Vietnam have ""massive"" contamination at more than 1,000 square kilometres (386 square miles), followed by Cambodia and Iraq.  rjm/kjm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, saying the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza.  Health authorities in the Palestinian enclave, which is controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said a five-year-old girl was among 15 people killed since Friday, adding that more than 120 have been wounded.  Civilians meanwhile took refuge in air raid shelters on the Israeli side, with AFP journalists hearing sirens warning of incoming fire in the Tel Aviv area on Saturday evening.  Israel's ongoing strikes are being met with barrages of rockets from the Palestinian side, stoking fears of a repeat of an 11-day conflict that devastated Gaza in May 2021.   Daily life in the enclave has come to a standstill, while the electricity distributor said the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said the next few hours will be ""crucial and difficult"", warning it risked suspending vital services within 72 hours as a result of the lack of electricity.    - 'We are all alone' -    In Gaza City, resident Dounia Ismail said Palestinians have become accustomed to preparing a ""survival bag"" of items such as money and medicine.  ""This latest escalation brings back images of fear, anxiety, and the feeling that we are all alone,"" she told AFP.  On the Israeli side of the frontier, the Magen David Adom emergency service said two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others were lightly hurt while running for safety.  In Kibbutz Nahal Oz, an Israeli community beside the Gaza border, resident Nadav Peretz said he has been ""in the bomb shelter or around it"" since Friday.   ""We recognise that on the other side too there is an uninvolved civilian population, and on both sides children deserve to enjoy their summer vacation,"" the 40-year-old said.  An Israeli military spokesman said its forces were ""preparing for the operation to last a week,"" and told AFP that the army is ""not currently holding ceasefire negotiations"".  Islamic Jihad's leader in Gaza, Mohammed al-Hindi, said: ""The battle is still at its beginning.""  Israel and Islamic Jihad confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key commander of the militant group, in a Friday strike.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. Both are blacklisted as terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare-up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that conflict.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.    - Five-year-old girl -    Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza City's main hospital, said medics are facing ""acute shortages of medical supplies"".   The UN humanitarian chief for the occupied Palestinian territories, Lynn Hastings, urged the warring sides to allow ""fuel, food, and medical supplies"" to be delivered to Gaza amid the worsening crisis.  On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl"" was among those killed by Israeli fire.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said Friday ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  The Gaza strikes followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people in the West Bank it said were members of the group.   Israel has conducted a wave of often deadly raids inside West Bank towns and cities since mid-March in response to lethal attacks on Israelis.  bur-rsc/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The internet went down on the eve of the vote, with some parts of the country reporting complete disruptions or significant slowdowns, after one of the most violent election campaigns in years.  Voting was delayed in several locations in the capital Kampala, beginning about half an hour after the official starting time of 7am (0400 GMT), and will continue until 4pm (1200 GMT).  Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, having ruled for almost four decades, against singer-turned-MP Bobi Wine, 38, whose popularity among a youthful population has rattled the former rebel leader.  In the Kamwokya slum, where Wine grew up, voters streamed in to a polling station in a dirt clearing, as police tried to keep social distance as coronavirus cases continue to surge.  A group of about two dozen riot officers marched past, with heavy military and police presence in other parts of the capital.  ""I am here to change the leadership of this nation because for years they've been telling me they will secure my future. They have not done that,"" said driver Joseph Nsuduga, 30, one of the first in line to vote.  ""I need to see change for my children. People are yearning for change but we are seeing nothing.""  Some 18 million voters are registered for the presidential and parliamentary vote, which will unfold in nearly 35,000 polling stations.  Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  The run-up to polling day was marred by a sustained crackdown on Museveni's rivals and government critics, and unprecedented attacks on the nation's media and human rights defenders.  In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces loyal to Museveni during protests against one of Wine's numerous arrests.  On Wednesday armoured-personnel carriers with mounted machine guns patrolled parts of Kampala and army helicopters and surveillance drones flew over the teeming capital where the political opposition has traditionally enjoyed support.    - Hopes and threats -    The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  In a statement, US ambassador Natalie Brown warned the refusal meant the election ""will lack the accountability, transparency and confidence"" brought by independent oversight.  On Tuesday, Museveni announced the suspension of social media networks and messaging services like Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp in response to Facebook closing accounts linked to government officials the tech giant said were spreading misinformation.  Wine is the strongest of 10 opposition contenders trying to unseat Museveni.  But most observers expect the ageing president and his ruling National Resistance Movement to emerge victorious.  He has never lost an election, and has been counting down the days to victory in confident campaign advertisements, promising to invest more in infrastructure, health and education and build Uganda's economy.  But Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has accused the president of presiding over corruption and failing to deliver jobs.    - Generation gap -    The population has a median age of just less than 16, and many Ugandans have never known anyone but Museveni in charge.  ""This is the time I've been longing for. I have finished casting my ballot and I hope my candidate wins,"" said businessman Abbey Musaka, 37, who voted at Njovu polling station in another area of Kampala, without saying who he was supporting.  Wine has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.   The opposition leader has urged them to turn out in large numbers and vote, saying they should not fear intimidation by the authorities.  Museveni, who has suggested Wine is supported by foreign and criminal elements, warned his opponents against taking to the streets.  ""If you use violence to protest against an election result, that is treason,"" Museveni said in a national address Tuesday.  Results are expected by Saturday evening.  str-np-fb/rbu   FACEBOOK    Twitter","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Yet sometimes it is the quiet moments that kill -- when there is a let-up in shelling and a stillness descends -- as thoughts inevitably return to family and home.    The Ukraine army's 10th Battalion had begun pushing forward, excavating new trenches in the humus-rich grassland soil just two kilometres (1.2 miles) from the Russian border, when it experienced such a lull.  ""We had missiles and shooting periodically. But now we have the grain armistice for the harvesting period on both sides,"" says Sergeant Chekh, whom AFP is identifying by his code name in accordance with security protocol.   ""But in two or three days when it's over, the artillery and mortar shelling will resume with renewed vigour.""  The 51-year-old squadron commander has family behind enemy lines in Kherson, a largely Russian-occupied province 500 kilometres away from the war he is fighting in the northeastern Sumy region.  ""I've had no contact with my mother for three months and I don't know if she's alive. She's 88 years old,"" he tells AFP in a brogue so gentle he is almost whispering.  ""I've had some contact with the neighbours, and I sent money, but I have no idea of the situation.""    - 'Motivation' -    A lawyer by profession, Chekh brought his family to the relative safety of the western city of Lviv when war broke out, and then volunteered at the local recruiting office.   As well as worrying about an uncontactable mother, he longs to be reunited his wife, two daughters and young son, all of whom are waiting out the war abroad.   He says the goal of getting back to his family is what keeps him going.  ""'Difficult' isn't really the right word for it,"" he tells AFP. ""For me it's another motivation that supports me and helps me to focus my mind on the job in hand.""  Nearby, Chekh's comrades sit under the forest canopy smoking and swapping stories as they take a break from digging trenches, their main job while the pause in fighting continues.  Around 150 civilians have died in the war in the Sumy region, its 39-year-old governor Dmytro Zhyvytsky told AFP.  The towns and villages along its 564-kilometre border with Russia are still experiencing almost daily bombardment by Grad rockets, howitzers and mortars, he said.  But for now, at least, the 10th Battalion's part of the frontline seems oddly peaceful.  On the short trek through dense woodland to get to the new frontline, there is no crackle of gunfire or the familiar boom of exploding shells that tightens the throat and quickens the blood.    In a moment of unintentional comedy, the air vibrates with a cacophonous wail that sounds like a warrior's battle cry -- but then a snare drum kicks in and it's obvious that it's just someone's ringtone.     - Role model -    The laconic company commander, Captain Roman, oversees the excavation of the new trench, hands joined formally behind his back as if on a parade ground rather than a mound of mud.  He scans the treeline, eyes narrowing, looking for signs of movement from the enemy that never come.  ""They shoot artillery and grenades from time to time and there is always the odd single shot,"" the 43-year-old tells AFP, almost apologetically.  Around 90 percent of the fighters in the 10th Battalion are volunteers who have seen little or no combat, but their commanding officers say that what they lack in experience, they make up for in heart.   ""We are here to defend our country,"" Roman tells AFP. ""The soldiers know they can die, but they are ready to fulfil their task -- to defend Ukraine.""  Down below, platoon commander Lieutenant Volodymyr proudly shows off the new trench -- apparently a labour of love -- as he explains his motivation for volunteering.  An administrative worker at Lviv's polytechnic in another life, the 43-year-old quit his job and signed up because he wants to be a role model for his two sons.  He has thought about the effect that his death in combat would have on 12 and 16-year-old boys, but he argues that his valour would also set them a good example.  ""If I'd stayed in Lviv doing nothing, what example would that be to my sons about being patriotic to Ukraine?""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

Overnight strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine killed 13 people and injured 11, with five reported to be in a serious condition, regional governor Valentin Reznichenko wrote on Telegram.  Most of the casualties were in the town of Marganets, just across the Dnipro River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest.  ""It was a terrible night,"" Reznichenko said, urging residents to shelter when they hear air raid sirens.  ""I am asking and begging you... Don't let the Russians kill you,"" he wrote.  Another woman died after Russian missiles slammed into a village in the Zaporizhzhia region on Wednesday morning, local governor Oleksandr Starukh wrote on Telegram.  Regional council head Mykola Lukashuk said the strikes had hit a local power line, leaving thousands of people without electricity.    - G7 call over nuclear plant -    Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of recent shelling around the Zaporizhzhia plant, which has six reactors.  Ukraine says Russia has stationed hundreds of troops and stored ammunition at the facility since taking it over on March 4, shortly after starting its invasion.  The tensions have revived memories of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Soviet Ukraine, which killed hundreds of people and spread radioactive contamination over much of Europe.  The Group of Seven industrialised nations condemned Russia's occupation and called on Moscow to immediately hand back full control of the plant.  Ukrainian staff operating the plant must be able to work ""without threats or pressure"" and Russia's control of the plant ""endangers the region"", the G7 foreign ministers said in a statement.  The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Thursday to address the crisis at the nuclear plant, diplomatic sources said.  The UN nuclear safety watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a statement that its Director General Rafael Grossi would brief the Security Council meeting ""about the nuclear safety and security situation"" at the plant as well as his ""efforts to agree and lead an IAEA expert mission to the site as soon as possible"".  The strikes came a day after major blasts at the Saki airfield, a key military base on the Russian-annexed Crimea peninsula.  Moscow insisted that the explosions were caused by detonating ammunition rather than Ukrainian fire, and Ukraine has not claimed responsibility.    - 'There is a lot of shooting' -    Fighting also ground on in eastern Ukraine, where Russian troops are gradually advancing.  Strikes on the city of Bakhmut killed at least six people and injured three others, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram, adding that 12 residential buildings were damaged.  The city of Soledar was under constant shelling, AFP reporters saw, as Russian troops attempted to drive out Ukrainian forces and seize a foothold towards Bakhmut.  The echoes of cluster bombs and artillery bounced off apartment buildings with their windows shattered, while roads were cratered and shops boarded up or destroyed.  The city was shrouded with black and white smoke arising from artillery and air strikes.  Some of those who remain now live underground in cellars ill-suited as bomb shelters.  ""Most have left. It's very scary. There is a lot of shooting,"" said 62-year-old Svitlana Klymenko.  ""I just want to leave to grow old in a normal way, die a normal death, not be killed by a missile.""    - EU ban on Russian coal -    The war has severely hampered grain supply from Ukraine, leading to an international food crisis as it is one of the world's biggest producers.  Some ships have been able to leave Ukrainian ports in recent days after a deal with Russia brokered by the United Nations and Turkey.  The first exports of wheat should start next week under the agreement, top UN official Frederick Kenney said on Wednesday.  The first grain shipment to leave on the Sierra Leone-flagged vessel Razoni departed the Ukrainian port of Odessa on August 1 and had been expected to dock in the Lebanese port of Tripoli at the weekend.  But the Ukrainian embassy said a new buyer for the shipment was being sought after the original Lebanese buyer cancelled the order.  Marine traffic sites showed the Razoni docked in Turkey's Mediterranean port of Mersin, following reports a new buyer had been found for its cargo.  Spain on Wednesday launched a pilot project to import Ukrainian grain by train to avoid blocked maritime routes, with a freight train leaving Madrid for the Polish town of Chelm late on Tuesday.  Western countries have meanwhile imposed increasingly stringent sanctions on Moscow, raising fears that Russia may cut off gas supplies.  EU countries have started putting into place different measures to save energy, with air conditioning curbs coming into force in Spain on Wednesday and Vienna dimming street lighting.  A total EU ban on imports of Russian coal was due to come into force overnight.   bur-imm/wd/st",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

The second demonstration in three days against Erdogan's pick for Bogazici University represented a rare challenge to the Turkish leader since he unleashed a sweeping crackdown after surviving a coup bid in 2016.  More than 1,000 people scuffled with police on Monday to protest Erdogan's appointment of Melih Bulu -- a losing candidate from the ruling AKP party in the 2015 general election -- as rector of the prestigious public institution.  Turkish police responded by arresting 36 people in a series of raids that began in the early hours of Tuesday.  They then fenced off the university to avert a planned rally by students and their supporters on Wednesday.  Organisers regrouped and decided to hold a protest march instead.  Hundreds walked chanting and holding up slogans along the Bosphorus before boarding a ferry and crossing to the Asian side of Istanbul for a rally attended by a crowd that AFP reporters estimated at more than 1,000.  Anti-riot police watched without intervening along the route.  ""To walk together on such a day of defiance makes us feel very good,"" said student Zehra Aydemir.  ""I am proud that my friends and I were able to meet up and fight for what we want,"" added university graduate Cinar Cifter.  The march attracted a mixed but overwhelmingly young crowd that held up political posters and waved rainbow flags in support of LGBTQ rights.  Some danced around to the sounds of Metallica -- an ironic refence to a TV interview Bulu gave Tuesday in which he claimed to listen to the US heavy metal group.  Erdogan has not referred to the protests in public.

A-listers made a valiant effort to keep up the energy at the mostly virtual, pre-produced show dubbed ""Celebrating America."" Among the few live artists was opener Bruce Springsteen, a man strumming his guitar in solitude, save for Abraham Lincoln in his neoclassical sanctuary.  Clad in jeans, a black peacoat and three discreet gold hoops in his ears, America's dad played ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" to launch the special event hosted by actor Tom Hanks set at the Lincoln Memorial.  Biden and his family bopped before a TV screen in their new Washington home, as pop star Demi Lovato got an assist from healthcare workers nationwide to sing the late Bill Withers' ""Lovely Day.""

""AND I loved honoring the late great Nina Simone, my constant source of musical inspiration.""    - 'New beginning' -    Veteran and incoming presidents along with campaigning hopefuls have long sought to lean on star power and song to bolster their images.  Along with the celebrities, Biden also got a bump from his predecessors: Barack Obama, George W.

""Yet, in truth, inauguration day is nothing more than the swearing in of the next national leaders, and this day is about witnessing the permanence of our American ideal.""  Both Biden and Kamala Harris also made an appearance at the memorial, with the latter saying the moment ""embodies our character as a nation.""

""We would propose to review that immediately to make sure that what we're doing is not impeding the provision of humanitarian assistance,"" Blinken said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  ""At least on its surface, (the designation) seems to achieve nothing particularly practical in advancing the efforts against the Huthis and to bring them back to the negotiating table while making it even more difficult than it already is to provide humanitarian assistance to people who desperately need it,"" Blinken said.  Outgoing US President Donald Trump's administration announced the move on January 11, nine days before Biden takes over on Wednesday.  The United Nations and aid groups warned it risks worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis.  The Iran-backed Huthis are facing a bloody offensive led by US ally Saudi Arabia, with millions in the country depending on aid to survive.  The Huthis, who control much of the north of the war-ravaged country, warned Tuesday they would respond to any action against them following their US classification as ""terrorists.""  ""We are ready to take all necessary measures against any hostile act,"" they said in a statement.  The designation is expected to halt many transactions with Huthi authorities, including bank transfers and payments to medical personnel and for food and fuel, due to fears of US prosecution.  Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, called on the United States to reverse the move.  ""Our position on this has not changed,"" Dujarric said. ""We call on the government to reverse that decision.""  ""Our concern from the beginning, that we expressed very clearly, is the impact on the commercial sector,"" he said.  ""The vast majority of food and other basic supplies that comes into Yemen comes in through the commercial sector.""  Blinken said the United States needs to be ""clear-eyed about the Huthis.""  ""They overthrew a government in Yemen, they engaged in a path of aggression through the country, they directed aggression toward Saudi Arabia and committed atrocities and human rights abuses,"" he said. ""And that is a fact.  ""What's also a fact, though, is that the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen has contributed to what is by most accounts the worst humanitarian situation anywhere in the world.""  bur/cl/ft",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Authorities have so far been unable to explain why the 26-year-old plane crashed just four minutes after takeoff, but say they've pinpointed the location of the black boxes.  A recording of conversations with air traffic control pointed to routine exchanges, and there was no communication as the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged about 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) in less than a minute before slamming into the Java Sea, said National Transportation Safety Committee investigator Nurcahyo Utomo.  ""It's like a normal conversation and nothing suspicious,"" he told AFP.  ""There's no talk of an emergency or something like that.""  The preliminary data suggested it was ""most likely"" the plane was intact when it hit the water Saturday, he added.  ""But we don't know at this stage"" what caused the crash, Utomo said.  - Switched flight -    There were 62 Indonesian passengers and crew aboard the half-full flight, including 10 children.  The jet's captain, Afwan -- a 54-year-old father of three who like many Indonesians goes by one name -- was a former air force pilot with decades of flying under his belt, according to local media.  Some of the 2,600 personnel working in the recovery effort involving dozens of boats and helicopters are hauling body parts, twisted piece of wreckage and passengers' clothing from shallow waters about 23 metres (75 feet) deep.  Body bags filled with human remains were being taken to a police morgue where investigators hope to identify victims by matching fingerprints or DNA from their remains to living relatives.  Rapin Akbar, who gave a blood sample to the hospital, had five relatives on board including an older sister, a nephew and his wife and their seven-month-old baby.  They were flying back to Pontianak, the city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes away.  ""(My nephew) had planned to go back to Pontianak on Sunday but changed his mind and decided to fly on Saturday instead,"" Akbar told AFP.  ""He called me to say the flight was delayed and sent me a picture of their baby. It was (their) first.""  Late Monday, authorities identified flight attendant Okky Bisma, 29, as the first confirmed victim after matching fingerprints from a retrieved hand to those in a government identity database.    - Black box data -    Divers searched waters off Jakarta for black boxes -- cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- that could be crucial to help explain why the plane went down.  Despite the name, black boxes are usually bright orange with reflective stripes, and all commercial planes are obliged to have them on board.  Built to survive at vast depths and in extreme heat, they are fitted with a beacon which can emit a signal for a month.  The devices record information about the speed, altitude and direction of the plane as well as flight crew conversations.  Black box data help explain nearly 90 percent of all crashes, according to aviation experts.  The probe into Saturday's crash is likely to take months.  Aviation analysts said flight-tracking data showed the plane sharply deviated from its intended course before it went into a steep dive, with bad weather, pilot error and mechanical malfunction among the potential factors.  ""Something quite dramatic has happened after takeoff,"" said Stephen Wright, professor of aircraft systems at Finland's Tampere University.  ""The airspeed is far too low. The aircraft didn't accelerate up to the correct speeds for continuous flight.""    - Spotty safety record -    Sriwijaya Air, which flies to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said little about the plane, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.  The Indonesian carrier has not recorded a fatal crash since it started operations in 2003.  But the nation's fast-growing aviation sector has long been plagued by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.  That accident -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the accidents.   The 737 model that went down Saturday was first produced decades ago and was not a MAX variant.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.   A year later more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/fox   BOEING    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

Here's a rundown of the unusual memes and symbols from recent anti-government rallies and what they mean.    - Blue underwear -    Since December Russian protesters have hung blue boxer shorts on street signs, posted pictures clad in just blue underwear and held them at protests to show how the country's best-known opposition figure claims he was poisoned.  Navalny, who suffered an attack with the Novichok nerve agent in August, says agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB) placed the toxin in the lining of his blue underwear.  When President Vladimir Putin marked the Orthodox ritual celebrating the baptism of Jesus Christ this month by dunking himself in ice-cold water wearing blue swimming trunks, Navalny's allies joked that Putin was sporting his top opponent's undergarments.    - Toilet brushes -    After spending five months in Germany recovering from the poisoning, Navalny returned to Russia this month and was immediately detained.  The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner called for mass rallies, spurring on the protests by releasing an investigation into a lavish property on Russia's Black Sea coast that he alleged is owned by Putin.  The complex, which Navalny says cost more than $1.35 billion, allegedly features everything from an underground ice rink to a casino.  But what stuck out to the Russian opposition was the reported cost of a high-end toilet brush: 700 euros ($619). Several protesters brought what appeared to be considerably cheaper versions to last weekend's rallies.    - Snow tools -     At the demonstrations in Moscow, protesters pelted riot police and even a car that reportedly belonged to the FSB with snowballs.  They also wrote their demands, including ""Free Navalny"", on a snow-covered wall, which a police officer was filmed immediately wiping away.  But the action at times grew violent, with protesters cracking a window of the reported FSB car and the TASS news agency reporting that snowball throwers damaged the driver's eyesight.  Investigators have since opened 21 criminal cases in connection with the rallies, including probes into violence against law enforcement officials.  Four people nationwide were detained for building snowmen that held signs with political slogans, including ""Freedom. Truth. Russia"" and ""Down with the Tsar"".    - Protest anthems -    Many of the demonstrators expected they would face consequences for attending the rallies, which saw more than 4,000 people detained nationwide.  On TikTok, the video-sharing app popular with teenagers, users shared posts preparing for the protests with a song featuring the lyrics: ""I will get jailed"".  With protests planned this weekend, demonstrators have kept their spirits up with up tempo tunes.  One doing the rounds features another detail from Navalny's ""Putin palace"" report: a room from leaked architectural blueprints of the property and called the akvadiskoteka, or aquatic disco.  Protesters played the most popular rendition of the song at the rallies last weekend. And they have taken to calling others to join this weekend's planned demonstrations by referring to them with a euphemism: aquatic disco parties.  emg/jbr/ach",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

Daria Dugina, 29, who died Saturday outside Moscow, was the daughter of ultranationalist Alexander Dugin, a vocal supporter of the Ukraine invasion launched by President Vladimir Putin six months ago.  Kyiv has rejected the claim by Russia's FSB security services that the killing was the work of a Ukrainian woman sent to track and eliminate Dugina, who later fled to Estonia.  ""Could we get 400 grammes [just under a pound] of TNT into Russia? In theory, yes. Could we set a bomb? Yes,"" a high-ranking member of Ukraine's intelligence service told AFP on condition of anonymity.  ""But the big problem is, what good would it do? Nobody in Ukraine even really knows about Dugin. Who would have something against his daughter? Killing her makes no sense,"" the source said.  Since Russia's seizure of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, Ukraine has effectively been waging a clandestine war against Russia, building out spy networks in preparation of future tensions.  ""I think that since March there are Ukrainian logistical and operational networks in place in Russia... There are Ukrainians on the other side of the border,"" said Gerald Arboit, an international intelligence expert at the CNAM research institute in Paris.    However, ""For this type of attack you'd need reconnaissance, to follow her, and then call in a team to carry it out -- you'd need two or three people to booby-trap a car -- one person alone couldn't do it all,"" he said.  He did not dismiss Ukrainian involvement, possibly with domestic Russian opposition groups, noting that Russia's FSB security services had dismantled Ukrainian networks in recent years.     - Counter-productive -    Getting Ukrainian agents into Russia would also require eluding Russian intelligence agencies presumably on high alert after six months of war.  ""The assassination of Dugina took place in Moscow, which would be an incredibly hard target for the Ukrainian services to penetrate,"" said Colin Clarke, research director at the Soufan Center in New York.  ""But at the same time, I think it could be possible... elite Ukrainian special forces or intelligence assets are likely capable of pulling off the attack,"" he said.  Experts also noted that Dugina's killing would most likely serve Putin's interests, fomenting anger that could bolster support for a general mobilisation to muster more soldiers for a war that has largely stalled in Ukraine's south and east.  ""I don't rule out that Dugina was killed by the Russians to step up the Ukraine war, potentially with non-conventional weapons"" such as thermobaric bombs, said a French intelligence source contacted by AFP.  Targeted assassinations of high-profile Russian targets, particularly a young woman, would also be counter-productive for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is banking heavily on sympathy and military aid from Western allies.  ""I don't see the rationale of such an operation for the Ukrainians, which would be very complex to carry out,"" said Alexander Grinberg, an analyst at the Jerusalem Institute for Security and Strategy.  ""And I can't imagine the Americans or British letting them do it,"" he added. ""It seems like an FSB ploy to undermine Kyiv, especially since Dugin doesn't have any real influence at the Kremlin.""  Clarke agreed that if Ukraine were to assassinate a high-profile Russian, Dugina would not be its choice.  ""I still suspect this was done by another entity, including the possibility that this was an inside job,"" he said.  fz-dla/js/tgb/jj",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, saying the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza.  Health authorities in the Palestinian enclave, which is controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said a five-year-old girl was among 15 people killed since Friday, adding that more than 140 have been wounded.  Civilians meanwhile took refuge in air raid shelters on the Israeli side, with AFP journalists hearing sirens warning of incoming fire in the Tel Aviv area on Saturday evening.  Israel's ongoing strikes are being met with barrages of rockets from the Palestinian side, stoking fears of a repeat of an 11-day conflict that devastated Gaza in May 2021.   Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Cairo is talking ""around the clock"" with both sides, which so far have rejected calls for hostilities to end.  Daily life in Gaza has come to a standstill, while the electricity distributor said the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said the next few hours will be ""crucial and difficult"", warning it risked suspending vital services within 72 hours as a result of the lack of electricity.    - 'We are all alone' -    In Gaza City, resident Dounia Ismail said Palestinians have become accustomed to preparing a ""survival bag"" of items such as money and medicine.  ""This latest escalation brings back images of fear, anxiety, and the feeling that we are all alone,"" she told AFP.  On the Israeli side of the frontier, the Magen David Adom emergency service said two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others were lightly hurt while running for safety.  In Kibbutz Nahal Oz, an Israeli community beside the Gaza border, resident Nadav Peretz said he has been ""in the bomb shelter or around it"" since Friday.   ""We recognise that on the other side too there is an uninvolved civilian population, and on both sides children deserve to enjoy their summer vacation,"" the 40-year-old said.  Egypt's Sisi said Cairo is ""making great efforts with our partners to restore calm"".  ""Contacts are maintained around the clock with everyone, so that things do not get out of control,"" the president said in a speech.  But an Israeli military spokesman said its forces were ""preparing for the operation to last a week,"" and told AFP that the army is ""not currently holding ceasefire negotiations"".  Islamic Jihad's leader in Gaza, Mohammed al-Hindi, said: ""The battle is still at its beginning.""  Israel and Islamic Jihad confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key commander of the militant group, in a Friday strike.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. Both are blacklisted as terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare-up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that conflict.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.    - Five-year-old girl -    Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza City's main hospital, said medics are facing ""acute shortages of medical supplies"".   The UN humanitarian chief for the occupied Palestinian territories, Lynn Hastings, urged the warring sides to allow ""fuel, food, and medical supplies"" to be delivered to Gaza amid the worsening crisis.  On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl"" was among those killed by Israeli fire.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said Friday ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  The Gaza strikes follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people in the West Bank it said were members of the group.   Israel has conducted a wave of often deadly raids in the West Bank since mid-March in response to lethal attacks on Israelis.  bur-rsc/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

""To meet its evolving battlefield requirements, the United States will continue to work with its allies and partners to provide Ukraine with key capabilities,"" the statement said.

""I've decided not to meddle in political affairs. I therefore announce now my definitive retirement,"" said Sadr, a longtime player in the war-torn country's political scene.  He made the announcement on Twitter, where he added that ""all the institutions"" linked to his Sadrist movement will be closed, except the mausoleum of his father, assassinated in 1999, and other heritage facilities.  His latest statement came two days after he said ""all parties"" including his own should give up government positions in order to help resolve a months-long political crisis.  Since legislative elections in October last year, political deadlock has left the country without a new government, prime minister or president, due to disagreement between factions over forming a coalition.  Sadr and his supporters have been calling for parliament to be dissolved and for new elections, but on Saturday he said doing so was not ""so important"".  Instead, it is ""more important"" that ""all parties and figures who have been part of the political process"" since the 2003 US-led invasion ""no longer participate"", Sadr said.  ""That includes the Sadrist movement,"" he said, adding that he was willing to sign an agreement to that effect ""within 72 hours"".  The grey-bearded preacher has millions of devoted followers and once led a militia against American and Iraqi government forces, following the toppling of dictator Saddam Hussein in the invasion.  Over the years, the chameleon-like figure has taken various positions and then reversed them.  Sadr's supporters have for weeks been staging a sit-in outside Iraq's parliament, after initially storming the legislature's interior on July 30, to press for their demands.  They were angered after their Shiite rivals, the pro-Iran Coordination Framework, nominated a candidate they saw as unacceptable for prime minister.

With employment faltering and virus infections soaring, President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Wednesday, has proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to revitalize the economy and kickstart the underperforming vaccination programs that will be critical to bringing the pandemic to an end.  If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen, who would be the first woman to serve as Treasury secretary, would be tasked with getting the massive bill through Congress.  That will entail convincing skeptical lawmakers that the benefit of more spending outweighs concerns about the country's soaring debt level.  ""Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country's debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,"" Yellen told the Senate Finance Committee at her confirmation hearing on Tuesday.    - Soaring spending -    Yellen, who also was the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, would take office as the world's largest economy struggles to get back on its feet after Covid-19 caused tens of millions of layoffs and a sharp contraction in economic growth.  She also would be one of the few Treasury secretaries with a background in economics and policy, rather than a career at a Wall Street investment bank.  Two previous pandemic relief bills passed by Congress have helped keep the country from a worse downturn by giving loans and grants to small businesses and expanding unemployment benefits, among other provisions.  But that spending also caused an explosion of the deficit for the 2020 fiscal year, which jumped more than 200 percent to an all-time high of $3.1 trillion, more than twice the prior record.   The spending continued in the first quarter of the 2021 fiscal year, breaking a quarterly record.  While some sectors have seen a steady rebound, there is evidence that the tentative recovery is flagging, with weekly Labor Department data showing the pace of layoffs increasing and the economy losing jobs in December.  But Oxford Economics said a ""fiscal paradigm shift"" is underway in how economists think about debt.  ""The growing consensus amongst academics and policy analysts is that what matters more than the levels of budget deficits and debt, is the currently low real cost of the debt -- the difference between the boost to growth and the debt servicing cost,"" the firm said in an analysis.  The Fed's commitment to keep the benchmark lending interest rate at zero for an extended period to promote full employment, is helping Yellen's case to focus on spending to boost the recovery rather than worry about debt for now.  ""It's something we will eventually need to attend to, but it's also important for America to invest,"" she said, adding the administration could consider issuing long-term debt to fund their plans.  Those investments will help prevent long-term scarring of the economy, she said.    - Watching Wall Street -    Prior to her nomination, Yellen gave indications that she would keep a close eye on Wall Street, though she also has taken money from some of its biggest firms after she left her role in government.  She spoke out against moves pursued by outgoing President Donald Trump's administration to loosen regulations on banks, but acknowledged at her hearing that they seemed to have weathered the shocks caused by the pandemic thus far.  Her image was however complicated by revelations that she earned more than $7 million in speaking fees since leaving her position as Fed chair in early 2018, including from financial giants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup -- a common if sometimes criticized practice.  Nonetheless, Yellen's nomination was met hopefully by groups like Americans for Financial Reform, which advocates for tighter controls on the nation's largest banks.  At her hearing, Yellen was not asked about regulation, but agreed that her focus would not be on providing aid to the financial industry.  ""Our focus should be on Main Street not Wall Street,"" she said.  cs/hs",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

We look back at six months of war that have killed tens of thousands of civilians.    - Invasion -     Russian President Vladimir Putin announces on February 24, 2022 a ""special military operation"" to protect the Russian-speaking self-declared separatist republics of Lugansk and Donetsk in the east, whose independence he has just recognised.  He says he wants to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, a former Soviet state, and demands a guarantee it will never join NATO.  A full-scale invasion starts with air and missile strikes on several cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pledges to stay in Kyiv to lead the resistance.  The European Union announces for the first time deliveries of arms to Ukraine. The West imposes unprecedented sanctions on Russia, which are toughened over time.    - Kherson falls -    Russian troops attack Ukraine's south coast, seizing most of the strategic region of Kherson, crucial for agriculture, and important due to its proximity to the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula.  On March 3, Kherson, the eponymous capital, becomes the first southern city to fall.    - Kyiv resists -     Russian troops seek to surround the capital Kyiv and to take Ukraine's second city Kharkiv in the northeast of the country but come up against resistance.  A month into fighting, Russia withdraws from northern Ukraine, announcing it will focus on conquering the eastern industrial Donbas region, partly held by separatists, along with the south.  On April 2 and 3, the corpses of dozens of civilians are found scattered on the street or buried in shallow graves in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, which Russian forces had occupied.  The International Criminal Court opens a probe.    - Mariupol conquered -     Russia besieges the strategic southeastern port city of Mariupol from the start of its invasion.   Russia declares on May 21 that it is in full control of the city, after Ukraine orders troops holding out for weeks in the Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms.  Nearly 2,500 soldiers surrender and are taken prisoner by Russia.  Kyiv says Mariupol is 90-percent destroyed and that at least 20,000 people have been killed there. The EU denounces ""a major war crime"".    - Grain blockade -    Kyiv and Moscow on July 22 sign a UN-Turkey mediated deal in Istanbul to resume grain exports in a bid to relieve a global food crisis caused by Russia's blockade of Ukraine's ports.  The first official shipment of grain since the invasion leaves the port of Odessa on August 1 with 26,000 tonnes of maize.  Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters, has some 20 million tonnes of grain built up in its silos.    - Gas war -    The West accuses Moscow of using energy as a weapon of war in retaliation for massive sanctions imposed after the invasion.  Vital exports of Russian gas to Europe, particularly to Germany and Italy, are slashed again and again, while Gazprom has also suspended deliveries to several European customers refusing to pay in rubles.    - Battle for Donbas -     On July 3, Russian forces say they control the eastern region of Lugansk after seizing the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk.  Moscow forces are now seeking to conquer Donetsk, the other province of the Donbas.  In the towns and cities under its control, Moscow is carrying out a policy of russification with the introduction of the ruble and the issuing of Russian passports. Referendums are also planned to make the annexation by Russia formal.    - Southern counter-offensive -    Over recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have been carrying out a counter-offensive in southern Ukraine.  With the help of US and European heavy weaponry, they have retaken dozens of villages and damaged strategic bridges in the Kherson region, Kyiv says.  Unclaimed blasts at a Russian military airbase and military facility in Crimea have led experts to suggest Kyiv might have managed to obtain or develop longer range missiles or carry out sabotage operations.     - Nuclear threat -    On August 5, Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine that is under Russian military control, raising the spectre of a nuclear disaster.  The Ukrainian operator of the plant, Europe's biggest, has accused Russian forces of preparing to link up the plant with the Crimea, damaging its electricity network in the process.  doc-kd-eab-jmy/kjm/smw   GAZPROM",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113565637']

Almost a year after the US registered its first death, the pace of the pandemic has picked up with 100,000 deaths coming in the past month, leaving the country with a toll far above any other nation.  The arrival of mass vaccination campaigns in the US and Europe had brought hope that the end was in sight, and the European Union said Tuesday it was aiming to inoculate 70 percent of its adult population before the end of August.  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said meeting the target could be ""a turning point"" in the fight against the virus.  But many EU countries -- and other nations including India and Russia -- have struggled to get their inoculation programmes off the ground.  As nations grapple with the current crisis, several inquiries have re-energised questions over the origins of the virus in China in late 2019, and how the authorities handled it.  Beijing has been accused of stifling whistleblowers who tried to raise the alarm, and experts said this week that officials could have reacted quicker to avert catastrophe.  But Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed the criticism, saying: ""As the first country to sound the alarm against the pandemic, we took prompt and decisive measures even though we had incomplete information at the time.""    - Travel ban row -    US President-elect Joe Biden has made tackling the pandemic his top priority, as he prepares to take office on Wednesday.  He is already being forced to take action, with his aides contradicting an order from outgoing President Donald Trump to lift travel bans designed to stop the spread.  ""With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,"" tweeted Jen Psaki, Biden's press secretary.  Caution was in evidence too in Taiwan, which called off its largest Lunar New Year lantern festival for the first time as authorities rushed to stem a Covid cluster in one of the few places to survive the pandemic largely unscathed.  And in Africa, Rwanda's capital Kigali was back under total lockdown after a surge in cases.    - Vaccine queue-jumping? -    Britain has been coping with a new strain of the virus thought to be far more infectious, and on Tuesday it registered a record 1,610 deaths over 24 hours.  There was however a sign of hope for Britain as the number of new cases over the last week was down around 22 percent, with a stringent lockdown announced this month having an effect.  Britain is in the middle of a massive vaccination drive, and more than four million people have now received a jab.  The government hopes to vaccinate the entire adult population by autumn.  As fears of new variants spread across Europe, Portugal also clocked a record daily number of fatalities and Germany tightened and extended its partial lockdown until mid-February.  Elsewhere in Europe, Serbia became the first European country to use the Chinese-made Sinopharm jab as it launched a mass vaccination campaign, while Austrian authorities were looking into reports of alleged queue-jumping for vaccines, including by several mayors.    - Holy scam -    The pandemic continues to batter the world of sport, forcing postponements and the quarantining of players.  Health officials said two Australian Open tennis players had tested positive -- a new blow for the tournament, which is facing a backlash from a wary public.  The unnamed players were among three new cases, taking the tournament's cluster to seven.  More than 1,000 players and staff are in quarantine after arriving last week in Australia, which is largely coronavirus-free.  Player complaints about quarantine have raised further hackles, and Australia's Nick Kyrgios led criticism of world number one Novak Djokovic for requesting improved conditions.  ""Djokovic is a tool,"" tweeted Kyrgios, the world number 47.  Meanwhile, another example of the quack cures and false claims that have proliferated in connection with the virus could be seen in Sri Lanka.  A self-styled holy man's supposed miracle potion to prevent Covid-19 turned sour after a minister who publicly drank it was hospitalised with the virus.  Thousands had defied public gathering restrictions to swamp a village in central Sri Lanka last month to get the syrup made by Dhammika Bandara.

Dozens of news outlets took part in the unprecedented 24-hour blackout, accusing the government of designing a tax that would limit freedom of expression and media pluralism.  ""This is where your favourite programme was supposed to be,"" read a message in white letters on a black background on the TVN24 news channel, which is owned by the US group Discovery.  The front pages of national newspapers, including the most widely read dailies Fakt and Gazeta Wyborcza, read simply: ""Media Without Choice"".  A statement on Gazeta Wyborcza's home page said: ""You should be able to see our content on this page. If the government's plans are successful, maybe one day you will no longer see it for real"".  Radio stations also suspended service, with Radio ZET informing its listeners that the tax would mean ""liquidation for some media businesses"".  ""There is no free country without independent media. There is no freedom without freedom of choice,"" the radio station said on its website.  The new tax, which is expected to take effect later this year, imposes a levy on advertising revenues of television and radio broadcasters, print outlets and internet media companies.  State-owned broadcaster TVP, which has become a mouthpiece for Poland's populist right-wing government, did not join in the protest action.    - 'Cornerstone of democracy' -    Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said earlier that the tax is part of Europe-wide efforts to tax global tech giants like Google or Facebook but independent media say they would be hit too.  Morawiecki has called it a ""solidarity fee"" that will ""create better conditions for the development of free media"" and help fund public healthcare and the culture sector.  Government spokesman Piotr Muller on Wednesday said the tax would only target large media companies and the rate would be between 2 and 15 percent of ad revenue, depending on the company's overall revenues and the type of advertising.  Muller said the tax would also affect public television and dismissed the protest saying that ""everyone would like to not pay taxes"".  Since coming to power in 2015, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has taken control of public media and has underlined the need to ""re-polonise"" the media landscape in the country.  In December, state-owned oil giant PKN Orlen bought the newspaper group Polska Press from the German company Verlagsgruppe Passau.  Poland's anti-monopoly office also recently turned down a request for a merger between Agora media group and Radio ZET -- a refusal that was seen as political by commentators.  The tax comes at a time when many media companies are already hit by shrinking advertising income and a loss of revenue because of the pandemic.  ""There has never been a protest on this scale in the history of Polish media,"" said Boguslaw Chrabota, editor of the Rzeczpospolita daily.  Chrabota wrote that the draft regulation was ""repressive for free media"", warning of ""a crisis that is slowly threatening our existence"".  The US charge d'affaires in Warsaw Bix Aliu also joined critics, tweeting: ""A free media is the cornerstone of democracy. The United States will always defend the independence of the media"".  Global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) tweeted its support for the media strike, accusing the PiS party of using the ""#COVID19 context as an opportunity to stifle the media.""  In its 2020 world report on press freedom, RSF found that ""partisan discourse and hate speech are still the rule within (Poland's) state-owned media, which have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces.""  dt/mas/lc   DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105427021']

Vote counting began after polls closed on Wednesday in the oil-rich nation, where multi-party elections were only introduced in 1992.  The election had been overshadowed by Angola's many woes -- a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought, compounded by the death of a former strongman president.  Preliminary results published on Thursday by Angola's electoral commission gave the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) 52.08 percent of the vote with more than 86 percent of ballots counted.   The main opposition group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Adalberto Costa Junior, 60, was at 42.98 percent.  An earlier count released overnight had given a much wider margin to the MPLA, which has ruled Angola for nearly 50 years after the country gained independence from Portugal.  Residents in Luanda reacted with mixed feelings to the preliminary count that was given ample coverage by local media, with state newspaper Jornal de Angola's front page on Thursday saying: ""MPLA leads the count.""  ""I voted for UNITA, and I do not believe in these results,"" said Jorge, a 40-year-old mechanic who did not give his surname, accusing the electoral commission of being in cahoots with the ruling party.   ""I feel really bad. The country is not going to change, it's always the same story.""  Lourenco, 68, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised a new era for the southern African nation when he succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago, has trumpeted a list of achievements.  The incumbent is credited with making far-reaching reforms, including boosting financial transparency and efficiency in parastatal organisations, fighting sweeping nepotism and corruption, and promoting business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors.  ""I am happy, the MPLA has given young people opportunities, there is more work and transparency,"" said 27-year-old shopkeeper Madalena Antonio commenting on the early results.   ""The government did what it could do. Things will get better.""    - Voter tampering fears -    The MPLA traditionally wields a grip over the electoral process, and state media and opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering.  Results in past elections have been contested, in a process that can take several weeks.  UNITA's deputy leader Abel Chivukuvuku had said earlier the party's own tally showed it was ahead.  ""Our poll counting centres... give us clear provisional indication of a winning trend for UNITA in all provinces of the country,"" he told a live streamed night conference. ""We are confident, calm and tranquil.""  More than 14 million people were registered to vote.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza also nurtured corruption and nepotism under dos Santos, who died in Spain last month.  The low-key, night-time repatriation of his remains in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre touch to the election.   Dos Santos will be buried on Sunday, which would have been his 80th birthday.  str-ub/raz   TOTALENERGIES","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

Records made public on Monday show Dorsey was served with a legal order to give Musk any communications or documents related to the takeover deal inked in April, as well as information touching on false or spam accounts or how Twitter calculates the number of its active users.  The subpoena asks for anything Dorsey has on the topics dating back to January of 2019.  Tesla boss Musk, the world's wealthiest man, has accused Twitter of fraud, alleging the company misled him about key aspects of its business, particularly the number of accounts that are actually spam or automated ""bots"" instead of people.  Twitter has stuck by its estimates that bots make up fewer than five percent of users.  Twitter also disputed Musk's assertion he has the right to walk away if its bot count is found to be wrong, since he didn't seek information on that topic when he made the buyout offer.  The company accuses Musk of contriving a story to escape a merger agreement that he no longer found attractive.  ""Musk's counterclaims, based as they are on distortion, misrepresentation, and outright deception, change nothing,"" Twitter said in a court filing.  Rival lawyers have been serving subpoenas for weeks seeking documents or depositions from a wide range of people connected with the buyout, running Twitter's business, and even with a holding company formed by Musk.  Twitter co-founder Dorsey in November of last year ended his second stint as chief of the company and had voiced support for Musk taking it over.  The Twitter deal included a provision that if the deal fell apart, the party breaking the agreement would pay a termination fee of $1 billion under certain circumstances.  Billions of dollars are at stake, but so is the future of Twitter, which Musk has said should allow any legal speech -- an absolutist position that has sparked fears the network could be used to incite violence.  The legal fight is gathering speed as preparations have begun for an October trial in Delaware's Chancery Court, which specializes in complex, high-stakes business battles.  Twitter has urged shareholders to endorse the deal, setting a vote on the merger for September 13.  While fielding questions at a recent Tesla shareholders meeting, Musk was asked whether his potential ownership of Twitter might distract from his running of the electric car company.  ""I think Tesla, you know, would continue to do very well even if I was kidnapped by aliens, or went back to my home planet,"" he joked, drawing laughter and applause.   ""To be frank, I don't have an easy answer,"" Musk added.  He assured shareholders that, for now, he has no plans to leave his Tesla chief role.  gc/mlm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112811646']

Hydrocarbons from the Termokarstovoye gas field in Siberia are transformed into jet fuel, which can ultimately be tracked to two military airbases near the Ukrainian border, the journalists wrote.  Squadrons based there have been accused by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of attacks on civilians, including the March 16 bombing of a Mariupol theatre where hundreds of people are believed to have died in what Amnesty described as a ""war crime"".  TotalEnergies -- formerly Total -- owns 49 percent of Terneftegaz, the company that extracts gas from the Termokarstovoye field, according to its 2021 annual report.  The other 51 percent is held by Russian company Novatek, in which the French firm also holds a 19.4 percent stake.  Le Monde wrote that natural gas condensates -- a liquid hydrocarbon recovered when extracting the gas itself -- are sent by pipeline for processing at a Novatek plant in Purovsky.  They are then sent by rail for further refining into jet fuel in the southern Siberian city of Omsk.  Since early 2022 shipments from there have reached airbases near the Ukrainian border, the newspaper reported, citing data from financial information firm Refinitiv -- the first such deliveries since 2017.  Beginning days before the war started in late February and through July, 42,700 tonnes of fuel were sent to the airbases at Morozovsk and Malshevo, the data showed.  That was ""enough to fill 3,400 Sukhoi Su-34 fuel tanks,"" the investigative nonprofit Global Witness wrote on its website, referring to a particular model of Russian fighter-bomber.    - 'No information' -    While most global energy giants have quit operating in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine -- often at great cost -- TotalEnergies has said it will stop purchases of Russian oil by the end of 2022, but has proved reluctant to abandon its gas business there.  Chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said in March that gas fields exploited by the company's joint ventures ""are going to operate whether I leave or not"" and remain vital for supplying energy to Europe.  Posting detailed responses it had earlier sent to Le Monde on its website, TotalEnergies said that the gas condensate from Termokarstovoye accounted for seven percent of the volume processed by Novatek at its Omsk refinery.  ""We don't know what would allow someone to say that the gas condensate produced by Terneftegaz is used to make jet fuel for use in Russian war planes,"" it added.

Some held up portraits of Navalny, others had signs reading ""Free Navalny!"" and ""No to Dictatorship!"".  The protesters were joined by environmental activist Yevgenia Chirikova, who fled from Russia to Estonia in 2015 fearing a crackdown on the opposition.  One participant, Eva, 26, who declined to give her surname, said she had also moved to Estonia, as had two of her friends who were also at the demonstration.

A small protest was also held in the Estonian city of Narva on the border with Russia, while around 100 people rallied in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius.  In Russia, thousands protested in different cities.  Navalny, 44, rose to prominence a decade ago and has become the central figure of Russia's opposition movement, leading large-scale street protests against corruption and electoral fraud.  He called for protests after surviving a near-fatal poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent and returning to Moscow last weekend following months of treatment in Germany.

The other 51 percent is held by Russian company Novatek, in which the French firm also holds a 19.4 percent stake.  Le Monde wrote that natural gas condensates -- a liquid hydrocarbon recovered when extracting the gas itself -- are sent by pipeline for processing at a Novatek plant in Purovsky.  They are then sent by rail for further refining into jet fuel in the southern Siberian city of Omsk.  Since early 2022 shipments from there have reached airbases near the Ukrainian border, the newspaper reported, citing data from financial information firm Refinitiv -- the first such deliveries since 2017.  Beginning days before the war started in late February and through July, 42,700 tonnes of fuel were sent to the airbases at Morozovsk and Malshevo, the data showed.

At least 13 civilians lost their lives and dozens were wounded in the gun and bomb attack by the Al-Qaeda-linked group that began on Friday evening and lasted over a day, leaving many feared trapped inside the popular Hayat Hotel.  On Sunday morning, the area surrounding the hotel was quiet and the roads blocked by a heavy security presence as emergency workers and bomb disposal experts sought to clear the premises of any explosives and remove rubble.  The hotel building sustained heavy damage during the gunfight between Somali forces and the militants, causing some parts of it to collapse and leaving many people frantic for their loved ones who were inside when the attack began.  The attack was the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June, and underscored the challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist militant group.  The hotel was a favoured meeting spot for government officials and scores of people were inside when gunmen stormed the property.   Officials said earlier that dozens of people had been rescued, including three young children who had hid inside a toilet, but it is not known how many were still in the hotel when the siege ended around midnight.    - 'Tense' -    Dozens of people gathered near the road leading up to the hotel on Sunday morning, desperate for news of their family members as security forces guarded the area, not letting anyone through.  Businessman Muktar Adan, whose brother was inside the hotel when the attack started, told AFP he was waiting for permission to enter the hotel and look for his sibling.  ""My brother was inside the hotel the last time we heard from him, but his phone is switched off now and we don't know what to expect,"" he said.  Said Nurow, who heard the attack unfold as bullets and flames ripped through the hotel, said he was very worried about his friend who was a guest at the property.  ""I hope... (he) is alive, he stayed in the hotel according to the last information we got from his sister,"" he told AFP, describing the mood as ""tense"".  Somalia's allies, including the United States, Britain and Turkey, as well as the UN, have strongly condemned the attack. So did ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  The government is expected to hold a press briefing Sunday morning, according to a security commander.    - Twin explosions -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  According to police, the attack began with a blast caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel along with gunmen.  A second explosion occurred just minutes later, witnesses said, inflicting more casualties as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to help those injured.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  In a statement by the group's news agency cited by the SITE Intelligence monitoring group, the jihadists claimed to have held hostages during the siege, including government and security officials.  Al-Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office, and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopian border.  The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, but still control swathes of countryside and retain the ability to launch deadly strikes, often targeting hotels and restaurants.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  str/amu/ho/yad",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Hamas, the militant group which rules Gaza, said Israel has ""committed a new crime for which it must pay the price"".

The initiative, which appears certain to fail, flies in the face of rulings in dozens of courts and the findings by officials in several key states, that there were no widespread voting problems.   The Republicans' statement, signed by Cruz and six other current senators along with four senators-elect, asserts that ""allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.""  The group said that when Congress convenes in a joint session on Wednesday -- for what normally would be a pro-forma certification of Biden's victory -- they will demand the creation of a special commission to conduct an ""emergency 10-day audit"" of the election results.   The statement says individual states could then convene special legislative sessions and potentially revise their vote totals.  ""An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can't let it happen!"" Trump tweeted Saturday.  Posting a list of the 11 senators, Trump added: ""And after they see the facts, plenty more to come...Our Country will love them for it!""   They join Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who said earlier that he planned to raise objections on Wednesday.   A Republican member of the House of Representatives, Louie Gohmert, has also announced his plan to oppose certification, and more than 100 House Republicans reportedly will back his challenge.  Gohmert sought to further raise the stakes with a lawsuit that would have given Vice President Mike Pence -- traditionally in a ceremonial role in Wednesday's session -- the power to overturn the election result.  Pence opposed that effort, and a federal judge in Texas on Friday rejected the suit.  The Hawley and Gohmert challenges will ensure that Congress must meet to hear the complaints.     - 'The Electoral College has spoken' -    The Congress sessions, sure to be contentious, will play out against a backdrop of pro-Trump rallies in Washington next week encouraged by the president himself.   As with Trump's other attempts to reverse his election defeat, the latest political maneuvering appears doomed. Democrats control the House, and many Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday for certification.  The 11 senators conceded that most Democrats and ""more than a few Republicans"" would likely oppose their initiative.  Among them is Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose state was a battleground that helped tip Biden into the win column. Its result is expected to be among those contested on Wednesday.  ""A fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders,"" Toomey said on Twitter.   ""The effort by Sens. Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right.""He added: ""I voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday, I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.""  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has urged fellow Republicans to vote to certify and avoid a divisive political brawl, saying, ""The Electoral College has spoken.""  Biden won in the all-important Electoral College by a vote of 306 to 232.  ""This is cynical, anti-democratic posturing,"" presidential historian Tim Naftali told CNN.   Cruz is considered a likely 2024 presidential candidate. Hawley is also said to be positioning himself for a 2024 run -- and so is Pence.  bur-acb/to","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

The Egyptian jihadist, who the United States says has been killed in a hideout in the Afghan capital Kabul, never even attempted to replicate the charisma and influence of his predecessor Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States.  But after US special forces killed bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, he played a key role in encouraging a decentralisation of the group, which resulted in Al-Qaeda franchises emerging all over the planet.  These include the Al-Shabaab who still control a large chunk of rural Somalia, the JNIM active in West Africa -- in particular Mali, and the Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) branch.  ""He accepted major new players in the Al-Qaeda network,"" said Hans-Jakob Schindler, director of the NGO Counter-Extremism Project and a former UN advisor.  ""So it is a blow to Al-Qaeda,"" he said. But ""it's not going to stop anything"" planned by Al-Qaeda affiliates.    - 'Bit of a challenge' -    The most likely successors pointed to by analysts contacted by AFP include two other Egyptians.  One contender is Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian special forces lieutenant-colonel and figure in the old guard of Al-Qaeda, whose presence has been reported in Iran.  The Islamic republic's Shiite rulers officially oppose the Sunni Al-Qaeda but opponents have repeatedly accused Iran of cooperating with network and giving sanctuary to its leaders.    Also in the running is Abu Abd al-Karim al-Masri who is part of the leadership of Syrian jihadist group Hurras al-Din and believed to be in Syria.  ""Zawahiri was not involved in the day-to-day decision-making of the affiliates... but you need a figurehead with a certain prominence and seniority because all the heads of all the affiliates need to swear personal loyalty to him,"" said Schindler.  ""So replacing him is going to be a bit of a challenge.""  Rita Katz, the director and co-founder of the SITE Intelligence Group, said the Al-Qaeda succession was the ""big question"" in the wake of the killing of Zawahiri.  ""Unlike the situation after Osama bin Laden's killing, so much of its leadership has moved to Syria, where many were killed,"" she said.  She said that little is known about the whereabouts of Adel but emphasised it was far from certain he was still in the Islamic republic, where observers believe he spent some two decades.  ""Rumours are that he was released from prison in Iran and moved to Syria. However not much is known,"" she said.    - 'Dwindling bench' -    Adel joined the Egyptian Islamic Jihad group in the 1980s. He was arrested but later freed, and travelled to Afghanistan to join Al-Qaeda under Zawahiri.   Scrutiny over Tehran's alleged relationship with Al-Qaeda intensified in August 2020 following the killing in Tehran, reportedly by Israeli agents, of Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, the group's former number two under Zawahiri and known by his nom-de-guerre of Abu Mohammed al-Masri.  This prompted then US secretary of state Mike Pompeo to claim -- just a week before his boss president Donald Trump left office -- that Iran was the ""new Afghanistan"" for Al-Qaeda militants, a statement that was met with some scepticism by analysts.  The Soufan Center, a US-based security research organisation, said the killing of a number of Al-Qaeda old guard figures in recent years had left the network with a ""dwindling bench of potential successors"".  It said Adel's ""long presence"" in overwhelmingly Shiite Iran ""might taint his candidature in certain circles"".  Younger Al-Qaeda cadres may prefer a figure like Masri who in Syria ""worked assiduously to cultivate ties with potential recruits more focused on local targets and motivated by parochial grievances in regions engulfed by civil war and insurgency"".  ""The selection of Al-Qaeda's next leader will tell a great deal about the future plans of the organisation,"" it said.   sst-sjw/jh/ah   SCHINDLER HOLDING",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113379121']

""BFI is a Cuban military-controlled commercial bank that benefits directly from financial transactions at the expense of the Cuban people"" while giving ""preferential access"" to military and state companies, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement.  Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in a tweet: ""I reject new punitive measure of #US State Department to tighten blockade against #Cuba.  ""The inclusion of Cuban entities in its lists is intended to reinforce an economic siege that has failed to destroy the Cuban Revolution after 62 years.""

Such a move, which would severely impede foreign investment, could hinder the diplomacy of President-elect Joe Biden.

Earlier in the week Rodriguez repeated a frequent complaint that the United States itself shelters ""terrorist groups acting against Cuba.""  Cuban-American anti-communist activists deny any wrongdoing.  US Representative Gregory Meeks, the incoming chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has warned Pompeo against making the terrorism designation.  ""This would clearly be another stunt by President Trump and Pompeo, trying to tie the hands of the incoming Biden administration on their way out the door,"" he said.   A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on ""potential deliberations regarding designations.""  January 3 will mark the 60th anniversary of the United States severing relations with the island following its communist revolution.

Trump has not appeared in public for a week and, suspended from Twitter in the wake of his encouraging supporters to march on Congress, has been uncharacteristically silent.  There have been no call-ins to his favorite Fox News hosts, interviews with the networks, or speeches celebrating his stormy one-term administration.  In another first, Trump has yet to publicly congratulate Biden on his win, wish him luck, or invite him for the customary cup of tea in the Oval Office.  In one of his last acts before he flies to Florida from Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday morning, Trump is expected to issue scores of pardons, with speculation rife over who might make the list.  The latest indications are that Trump will not take the legally dubious step of issuing himself and his children preemptive pardons.  Outside the White House fence, central Washington has taken on a dystopian look ahead of Biden's inauguration, swarming with National Guard troops and largely emptied of ordinary people.  Covid-19 restrictions meant the swearing-in ceremony at noon on Wednesday was always due to be sparsely attended. But fears of right-wing attacks in the wake of the pro-Trump riot in the Capitol building on January 6 have triggered unprecedented deployments of armed soldiers, concrete barriers and secure areas dubbed ""green"" and ""red"" zones.  Adding to the tension, the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.    - Biden comes to town -    Biden, a veteran Democratic senator who also served as vice president to Barack Obama, was set to travel to Washington with his wife Jill Biden from their hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.  Together with incoming vice president Kamala Harris -- the first woman ever to hold the job -- Biden was due to deliver a Tuesday evening address on the Covid-19 crisis, from the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool.  This will give the incoming president and vice president a first glimpse of a city transformed for their inauguration.  The grassy Mall area, barred to the public, has been filled with some 200,000 American flags to represent the people who at any other inauguration would have come to witness history. Fifty six pillars of light will beam up to represent the 50 US states and territories.  Another eye-catching number is the more than 20,000 National Guards troops on duty, many of them carrying automatic rifles and dressed in full combat gear.  Illustrating the level of worry after the attack by the pro-Trump mob, the defense department said that all Guard troops were being vetted by the FBI and military for possible threats.  Biden is coming in with a strong message of unity, insisting that he can bring a divided country back to the center and confront the nation's multiple crises, starting with Covid-19, together.  To symbolize the new spirit, Biden has invited the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell -- and other top congressional leaders to attend a church service with him on Wednesday before the inauguration.  A person familiar with McConnell's plans confirmed to AFP the Republican congressional leader would join Biden, a longtime Senate colleague, in church.    - Pardons -    For Trump, the main piece of unfinished business is now the expected slew of pardons that he is reported to be preparing.  According to CNN and other US outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he will grant clemency to.  After what The New York Times reports has been an intense lobbying effort, these are expected to be a mix of white-collar criminals and people whose cases have been championed by criminal justice activists.  More controversial possible pardons that have been the subject of speculation for months would be for the likes of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Trump's influential advisor Stephen Bannon.  If Trump gave himself or his family a pardon -- something currently not expected, according to latest US reports -- that would likely harden anger among previously fully supportive Republicans in the Senate as they prepare the impeachment trial.  sms/ec",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The meeting was held behind closed doors and had been requested by European members and the United States after inter-ethnic fighting earlier this week left more than 200 people dead.  European members, the US and Mexico proposed a declaration urging the Sudanese government to accelerate the implementation of its plan to protect the population. But they met with refusal from the Council's African members, as well as India, Russia and China, who called for respect for Sudan's sovereignty, diplomats told AFP.  During the meeting, a majority of council members condemned the violence, one diplomat said, but some stressed it is the government's responsibility to fill the hole caused on December 31 when the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping mission, UNAMID, ended its 13 years of operations in Darfur.  UNAMID plans a phased withdrawal of its 8,000 or so armed and civilian personnel within six months.  Though a precarious calm appears to have returned to Darfur following the deployment of Sudanese troops, fears of fresh violence persist in the region, which has been battered by years of conflict.  At the end of last year, the UN reported that Sudanese authorities had pledged to deploy 12,000 troops to Darfur to take over from UNAMID in January.  Even after the end of the peacekeeping mission, the UN plans to remain in Sudan through a political mission based in Khartoum to help support the country's political transition.  The Darfur conflict that erupted in 2003 killed some 300,000 people and displaced 2.5 million, according to the UN.  It flared when ethnic minority rebels rose up against dictator Omar al-Bashir's Arab-dominated government. Khartoum responded by unleashing a notorious Arab-dominated militia known as the Janjaweed from among the region's nomadic tribes.  Bashir was ousted by huge pro-democracy protests in April 2019, and the country has been in a rocky transition ever since, with a stand-in government trying to stabilize Sudan's conflict-torn south and west.  prh/to/acb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had been hoping former health minister Salvador Illa, who led the ticket for his ruling Socialists, would win enough votes to end the separatist parties' grasp on power, thereby turning the page on the independence crisis.   Although the Socialists won most votes, equating to 33 of the Catalan parliament's 135 seats, they fell well short of an outright majority of 68, allowing the separatists to form another ruling coalition for this wealthy northeastern region of 7.8 million people.   ""If they were hoping to remove the separatists from power, they misread the situation,"" said Berta Barbet, a political scientist from Barcelona's Autonomous University, describing the aim as ""totally unrealistic"".  Despite bitter divisions which have rankled since the failed independence bid of 2017, the separatists actually emerged from the election with a stronger hand, increasing their number of parliamentary seats from 70 to 74  Helped by record abstentions which also played into their hands, the pro-independence parties even secured 50 percent of the votes for the first time in a regional election.   But the numbers don't reflect the reality on the ground with a January survey showing 44.5 percent of Catalans in favour of separating from Spain, and 47.7 percent against.     - The same, but different -    Within the separatist camp, the vote reshuffled the deck putting the more moderate ERC (""Republican Left of Catalonia""), which has supported Sanchez's government in the national parliament, ahead of its hardline rival JxC (""Together for Catalonia""), which has a more confrontational approach towards Madrid.   With the ERC taking 33 seats, its candidate Pere Aragones looks set to be the region's chief heading a coalition that would include JxC (32 seats) and the hardline leftwing CUP (9 seats).   In theory another formation could achieve the same numbers comprising ERC, the Socialists and leftwing hardliners Podemos (8 seats), in an echo of the Socialist-Podemos coalition in Madrid. But both ERC and the Socialists have ruled out the idea.   ""The most likely scenario is a repetition of the ERC-JxC coalition, with ERC at the head,"" said Barbet.  ""The easiest way of saying it is things will carry on as before but with slight changes,"" said Ernesto Pascual, professor of political science at the Open University of Catalonia.  Within the separatist camp, the vote gave ERC the edge over JxC which took the lead in the December 2017 vote. Since then, ERC has relinquished support for a unilateral break from Madrid and pushed for dialogue with the Sanchez government.  ""We will begin talks today,"" Aragones said on Monday, ahead of tough negotiations with his potential partners who advocate a confrontational line with Madrid.     - Won't be easy -    ""Their relationship isn't great and it will be complicated because they have contradicting aims,"" Barbet said.  Even though Sanchez's hope of dislodging the separatists from power didn't come off, the outcome is ""good news for the Spanish government"", said political analyst Josep Ramoneda.  On the one hand, Madrid will have a easier partner in Barcelona, while on the other, the outcome ""grants legitimacy to the government's policy"" of dialogue, he said.   This will give Sanchez room to tackle the Catalan issue and make gestures such as pardoning nine separatist leaders who were jailed for their role in the 2017 crisis in which the region held a banned referendum and briefly declared independence.  Since the end of January, the prisoners have benefited from a semi-open regime allowing them to work on weekdays and spend weekends at home, privileges which were overturned by Spain's top court late last year.

The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport in Jakarta on Saturday afternoon.  A military vessel ""has found the signal from (Sriwijaya Air) SJ182"" and divers had recovered parts of the plane from around 23 metres (75 feet) below the water's surface, the transport ministry said Sunday, citing Indonesia's military chief Hadi Tjahjanto.  The ministry did not specify if the signal was from the downed plane's black box.  The frantic search appeared to offer no hope of finding any survivors.  ""Several body parts have been found and they've been taken to the police hospital for identification,"" Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told AFP.  ""We don't know yet whether they're from one person. Belongings that we think are from the passengers were also found.""  A child's pink trousers, a broken tyre and wheel, life jackets and suspected wreckage from the plane were also found, according to authorities and AFP reporters on the scene.    - 'Torn into pieces' -    Flight SJ182 was bound for Pontianak city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  On Saturday night, distraught relatives waited nervously for news at Pontianak airport.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" Yaman Zai said as he sobbed.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  The discovery of body parts and wreckage came as a flotilla of warships, helicopters and divers were deployed off the coast of the sprawling capital Sunday.  Sixty-two passengers and crew were aboard the plane, all of them Indonesians, including 10 children, authorities said.  The plane crashed near popular day-trip tourist islands just off the coast, authorities said.  More than 300 personnel from search and rescue, the navy and the police were taking part in the search.  The search-and-rescue agency earlier said poor conditions were hampering the effort, but the military later said visibility had improved and the recovery operation would continue Sunday.  - Sudden dive -    Data from FlightRadar24 indicated that the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  The transport minister said Saturday that the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  Sriwijaya Air, which operates flights to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  It did not immediately comment when contacted by AFP again on Sunday.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  The jet that went down Saturday is not a MAX model and was 26 years old, according to authorities.  ""We are aware of media reports from Jakarta regarding Sriwijaya Air flight SJ-182. Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families,"" Boeing said in a statement.  ""We are in contact with our airline customer and stand ready to support them during this difficult time.""  Indonesia's aviation sector has long had a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.  Domestic investigators' final report on that crash said major factors included a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance, and the pilots' inadequate response.  A year later, in 2015, more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/leg   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

Japarov scooped more than 80 percent of the vote in Sunday's election in ex-Soviet Kyrgyzstan, with a similar proportion backing reforms in a simultaneous referendum that will grant him sweeping powers.  Speaking to supporters in Bishkek's central square -- the site of revolutions in 2005 and 2010 as well as unrest last year that helped propel Japarov to power -- he said opponents were ""scaremongering"" in their depictions of him as a hardliner.  ""There will be no dictatorship as some scaremongers say. There will be a dictatorship of law and justice,"" he said, borrowing a phrase from Russian leader Vladimir Putin, whose country is a key ally for Kyrgyzstan.  ""We have waited for this moment for 30 years,"" Japarov told supporters feasting on pilau and bread at a concert of traditional music, asking them to ""criticise, advise and guide"" him in his work.   Monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said on Monday the election had lacked ""a level playing field"" as Japarov's well-funded campaign dominated those of his rivals' campaigns.    - 'Voter intimidation' -    However, the organisation said the election and the parallel referendum were ""generally well organised"".  The United States embassy called in a statement Monday for authorities to investigate ""credible allegations of voter intimidation during the campaign period and on Election Day"" that were documented by a local monitoring group.  The 52-year-old had been serving jail time on hostage-taking charges until October, when his supporters freed him during mass protests.  He always described the conviction, which has now been overturned by a judge, as politically motivated, while strongly denying claims that he has ties to criminal networks that are deeply embedded in local politics.  The referendum result indicating a preference for presidential rule, as championed by Japarov, spells the end for a mixed constitution adopted a decade ago to tame authoritarianism, after two successive strongman presidents were ejected from power.  One Japarov supporter in the hundreds-strong crowd at the concert told AFP that he believed the vote winner was ""pure in his heart, thoughts and words"".  ""We see that he is ready to fight for the country,"" said Jakshylyk Saparaliyev, 45.   Another supporter, 65-year-old Damira Baiserkeyeva said that the politician ""came to us for our happiness"", while acknowledging that many citizens had reservations about him.   ""Good and bad are always close to one another. But I believe he is ready to work for the people.""  While Japarov has inspired his supporters during his rapid rise to power, turnout at the elections was less than 40 percent.     - Vote-buying down -    Political analyst Azim Azimov told AFP that he believed this was partly a result of less vote-buying, which he said happened on an ""industrial scale"" during the parliamentary vote which sparked a political crisis in October.   Former president Sooronbay Jeenbekov became the third Kyrgyz leader to resign in political chaos, as supporters freed their hero from prison the night after the vote and powered him to the top of the political pyramid.   With its threadbare economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Kyrgyzstan's next leader is likely to be even more dependent on Russia -- a destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrants -- and neighbouring economic giant China.  Putin had described the overthrow of the previous government as a ""misfortune"" and chided Kyrgyz politicians for attempting to imitate Western democracies.  But he was among the first leaders to congratulate Japarov on his victory, noting that further cooperation between the two countries ""meets the fundamental interests of our friendly peoples"" in a telegram Monday.  Beijing's ambassador met with Kyrgyz officials several times last year to discuss protection for Chinese businesses, some of which were attacked during the unrest in October.  The embassy said in a statement Monday that Beijing ""always respects the development path chosen by the Kyrgyz side in accordance with the national realities in the country"".","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104045825']"

The initiative, which appears certain to fail, flies in the face of rulings in dozens of courts and the findings by officials in several key states, that there were no widespread voting problems.   The Republicans' statement, signed by Cruz and six other current senators along with four senators-elect, asserts that ""allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.""  The group said that when Congress convenes in a joint session on Wednesday -- for what normally would be a pro-forma certification of Biden's victory -- they will demand the creation of a special commission to conduct an ""emergency 10-day audit"" of the election results.   The statement says individual states could then convene special legislative sessions and potentially revise their vote totals.  ""An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can't let it happen!"" Trump tweeted Saturday.  Posting a list of the 11 senators, Trump added: ""And after they see the facts, plenty more to come... Our Country will love them for it!""   They join Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who said earlier that he planned to raise objections on Wednesday.   A Republican member of the House of Representatives, Louie Gohmert, has also announced his plan to oppose certification, and more than 100 House Republicans reportedly will back his challenge.  Gohmert sought to further raise the stakes with a lawsuit that would have given Vice President Mike Pence -- traditionally in a ceremonial role in Wednesday's session -- the power to overturn the election result.  Pence opposed that effort, and a federal judge in Texas on Friday rejected the suit.  On Saturday, a federal appeals court upheld that dismissal.  The Hawley and Gohmert challenges will ensure that Congress must meet to hear the complaints.     - 'The Electoral College has spoken' -    The Congress sessions, sure to be contentious, will play out against a backdrop of pro-Trump rallies in Washington next week encouraged by the president himself.   As with Trump's other attempts to reverse his election defeat, the latest political maneuvering appears doomed. Democrats control the House, and many Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday for certification.  The 11 senators conceded that most Democrats and ""more than a few Republicans"" would likely oppose their initiative.  Among them is Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose state was a battleground that helped tip Biden into the win column. Its result is expected to be among those contested on Wednesday.  ""A fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders,"" Toomey said on Twitter.   ""The effort by Sens. Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right.""  He added: ""I voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday, I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.""  Utah Senator Mitt Romney, a vocal Trump opponent and onetime presidential candidate who lost a 2012 White House bid to Barack Obama, dismissed his colleagues' rationale as ""nonsense.""  ""The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic,"" Romney said in a statement.  ""Members of Congress who would substitute their own partisan judgment for that of the courts do not enhance public trust, they imperil it,"" he added. ""Has ambition so eclipsed principle?""  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has urged fellow Republicans to vote to certify and avoid a divisive political brawl, saying: ""The Electoral College has spoken.""  Pence, however, is reportedly encouraging lawmakers to debate the baseless accusations of voting irregularities.  ""Vice President Pence shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election,"" his chief of staff Marc Short said in a statement to US news outlets.  ""The vice president welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people on January 6th.""  Biden won in the all-important Electoral College by a vote of 306 to 232.  Cruz is considered a likely 2024 presidential candidate. Hawley is also said to be positioning himself for a 2024 run -- and so is Pence.  bur-to/axn","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

Wine told AFP he felt under threat as soldiers surrounded his home on Friday evening, after they jumped over the fence of his compound following his first accusations of fraud to the press.  Museveni, 76, is seeking a sixth term after almost four decades in power, and the former popstar Wine has emerged as his main rival in a youthful country where most have known only one president.  The internet remained down for a third day as vote counting continued from Thursday's poll, with provisional results from 39 percent of polling stations giving Museveni an early lead of 62 percent while Wine trailed with 29 percent.  As the results came in, Wine said in an interview at his home that soldiers had jumped the perimeter fence of his compound and beaten his security guard before taking up position around his house.  ""They jumped over my fence. They came inside my compound. They are here right now. I don't know why they're here. But I'm imagining they are here to harm me. I feel threatened,"" said the 38-year-old, who described the invasion as unprecedented and ""a siege"".  He said he confronted the soldiers, who briefly cocked a gun at him and journalists, and refused to respond or leave.    - 'We defeated the dictator' -    Earlier Wine had reeled of a list of election regularities during a press conference in his garden, such as ballot box stuffing, and his party's polling agents being beaten and chased away in parts of northern and western Uganda.  ""I am very confident that we defeated the dictator by far. I call upon all Ugandans to reject the blackmail. We have certainly won the election and we've won it by far,"" Wine said journalists.  ""Whatever is being declared is a complete sham, we reject it and we dissociate ourselves with it.""  Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, promised to provide video evidence once the internet was restored.   Election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said he did ""not appreciate the assertion that these results we are reading out are rigged"".  ""The onus is on candidate Kyagulanyi to show how votes are rigged.""  On Friday morning the capital Kampala was quiet and some businesses remained closed, while soldiers and police patrolled on foot.  Full results are expected by Saturday afternoon.  Museveni faced a total of 10 candidates, but it is the popularity of the former popstar Wine, who grew up in a slum and is nicknamed the ""ghetto president"", that has rattled the former rebel leader.  The poll followed one of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and scores of deaths.  However Byabakama said the vote had gone off in a ""peaceful and tranquil manner"".  Police spokesman Fred Enanga said there had been ""no major cases of violence reported"".  A senior foreign diplomat told AFP there had been sporadic incidents of violence and many irregularities, but no sign of mass manipulation.     - Observers denied -    The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  The United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, cancelled a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election, and aside from an African Union mission there was no major international group watching over the vote.  Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the median age is 16, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  But Museveni, one of Africa's longest serving leaders, has never lost an election and observers expect this time around will be no different.  His opponents -- most visibly Wine, who spent much of the campaign in a bulletproof vest and combat helmet -- were arrested, blocked from rallying and dispersed with tear gas throughout the campaign.  Two days of protests in November led to the deaths of 54 people.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Trump supporters broke into Congress as a session was being held Wednesday to certify Joe Biden's November election win, triggering unprecedented chaos and violence at the heart of American democracy, as well as accusations the president was attempting a coup.  Since his defeat, Trump has claimed the election was rigged against him, but has offered no substantive evidence. None of the nearly three dozen lawsuits his campaign has filed challenging the results has been successful.  As well as Fox News, new ultra-conservative outlets battling to nibble market share from the television news behemoth sought to dissociate Trump supporters from the chaos in Congress.  The demonstrators ""pushed and shoved but for the most part, that was about it,"" said Kevin Corke, a Fox News reporter.  ""Most of what we saw was beautiful today,"" said Ben Bergquam, a reporter for the small online channel Real America's Voice, on Wednesday.  - Deflecting the blame -    Outlets including Real America's Voice, Newsmax and the One America News Network (OAN) -- which Trump has recommended several times in recent weeks -- claimed without any evidence that the crowd had been infiltrated by small ultra-left groups.  ""I think they were undercover Antifa,"" Gina Loudon, presenter for Real America's Voice, said of the rioters she encountered Wednesday in the corridors of the Capitol.   Antifa is a mostly unstructured group of left-wing activists who are frequently denounced as violent troublemakers by Trump and his supporters.  Pat Fallon, a Republican in the House of Representatives, told Newsmax ""we don't even know who was on the other side of those doors"" among the rioters.  While denouncing the violence committed in the precincts of Congress, Greg Kelly, of Newsmax, said it nonetheless followed a certain logic.  ""If you steal an election,"" he explained, echoing Trump's discredited accusations, ""there are going to be a lot of angry people.""  ""There's a reason this is happening,"" said Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson. ""It is happening because the people with all the power have decided to clamp down so harshly on the population that things explode at a certain point.""  For Eric Greitens of Real America's Voice, the forced interruption to debates in Congress Wednesday ""gives the president a few more days to demonstrate that there has been fraud.""  Others denounced the reaction of the mainstream media.  ""They are going to say that all the Trump supporters are violent,"" said Grant Stinchfield of Newsmax.   ""I just wish they would have denounced the fact that so many cities have been damaged"" during the spring protests against racism, he added.  With Fox's Sean Hannity in the lead, many commentators highlighted the outgoing president's appeals for calm on Twitter -- though they were launched after the president had urged supporters to march on the Capitol and allowed the situation to escalate.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104705419', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104717056']"

Health authorities in the enclave controlled by Hamas Islamists said 10 people have been killed by Israel's bombardment, including a five-year-old girl, with 75 others injured. Israel's army estimated that its operation has killed 15 militants.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said the Jewish state was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive counter-terror operation against an immediate threat"" posed by the Islamic Jihad group, following days of tensions along the Gaza border.  Israel and Islamic Jihad have both confirmed the killing of a top commander with the militant group, Taysir al-Jabari, in a Friday strike.   Islamic Jihad said the initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"", before it unleashed a flurry of more than 100 rockets towards Israel.  The rocket fire and Israeli strikes continued overnight, risking a repeat of an 11-day conflict in May 2021 that devastated Gaza and forced countless Israelis to rush to bomb shelters.   ""Israel isn't interested in a wider conflict in Gaza, but will not shy away from one either,"" Lapid said in a nationally televised address.  Air raid sirens sounded overnight across several spots in southern and central Israel, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.   Officials in border areas urged people to stay close to shelters, which were also being opened in the commercial capital of Tel Aviv.  The army had initially confirmed at least 70 rocket launches from Gaza, saying 11 had fallen inside the strip, with dozens intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system, and that others had landed in open areas.   Egypt, a historic broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, was seeking to mediate and may host an Islamic Jihad delegation later Saturday, Egyptian officials told AFP in Gaza.    - Escalation, mediation -    Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May. Islamic Jihad is a separate group, aligned with Hamas, but that also acts independently.  A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor.  The sides exchanged fire for several days without Hamas joining the fray.   Hamas's moves amid the current violence could prove crucial in determining its severity, with the group facing pressure from some to maintain calm in order to improve economic conditions in the territory.   Gaza City resident Abdullah al-Arayshi said the situation was ""very tense"". ""The country is ravaged. We've had enough of wars. Our generation has lost its future,"" he told AFP.  Hamas said Israel has ""committed a new crime for which it must pay the price"".  Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.     - Five-year-old girl -    Flames poured out of a building in Gaza City following the first round of strikes, while wounded Palestinians were evacuated by medics.  Gaza's health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among nine people killed.   Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.   UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was ""deeply concerned"", warning that the escalation was ""very dangerous"".    - 'Pay the price' -    The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Islamic Jihad did not launch rocket attacks in response to the arrest, but Israel has insisted through the week that the group was committed to seeking revenge.   Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.  Gaza's only power station is at risk of imminent outage due to a lack of fuel supplies through Israel, its manager warned on Thursday.  bur-bs/mtp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Air raid sirens sounded across southern Israel on Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.  The Israeli military said the vast majority of 160 rockets fired from Gaza had either fallen within the Palestinian territory, or been intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defence system.  Officials in border areas urged people to stay close to shelters, which have also been opened in the coastal city of Tel Aviv.   Egypt, a historic broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, was seeking to mediate and may host an Islamic Jihad delegation later Saturday, Egyptian officials told AFP in Gaza.  But sources within Islamic Jihad denied a ceasefire was on the cards, with one saying: ""there is no talk whatsoever of Egyptian mediation and for the movement the focus is on the battlefield.""  The Arab League ""condemned in the strongest possible terms the ferocious Israeli aggression against Gaza,"" while Jordan's foreign ministry ""stressed the importance of halting the Israeli aggression"".   Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.   A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that episode.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.    - Five-year-old girl -    Fire balls and plumes of smoke have billowed out of targets hit in Gaza.  On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among those killed.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City on Friday for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border, after the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.   The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel has conducted a near relentless wave of often deadly raids inside the West Bank since mid-March in response to lethal attacks on Israeli citizens.   bur-rsc/dwo",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport in Jakarta on Saturday afternoon.  No reasons have yet been given for the crash, with authorities focusing on a frantic search and rescue effort that appeared to offer no hope of finding any survivors.  ""As of this morning, we've received two (body) bags, one with passenger belongings and the other with body parts,"" Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told Metro TV.  The discovery came as a flotilla of warships, helicopters and divers were deployed off the coast of the sprawling city Sunday.  Sixty-two passengers and crew were on board, including 10 children, all of them Indonesians, according to authorities.  Sriwijaya Air flight SJ182 was bound for Pontianak city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  It crashed in the Java Sea near popular day-trip tourist islands just off the coast.  Distraught relatives waited nervously for news at Pontianak airport on Saturday night.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" Yaman Zai said as he sobbed.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby today...How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  Officials said Sunday they would continue their search by sea and air while also using sonar radar to pick up more signs of the downed jet.  Divers marked at least three sites at the suspected crash site with orange ballons, according to an AFP reporter on the scene.  ""From our observation, it is strongly believed the coordinates match the ones from the plane's last signal contact,""  said Hadi Tjahjanto, head of Indonesia's military.  Hundreds of personnel from search and rescue, the navy, the police, with 10 warships also taking part in the search effort.    - Sudden dive -    Data from FlightRadar24 said the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  Indonesian Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said Saturday that the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  Sriwijaya Air, which has about 19 Boeing jets that fly to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  It did not immediately comment when contacted by AFP again on Sunday.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and a subsequent fatal flight in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  The jet that went down Saturday is not a MAX model and was 26 years old, according to authorities.   In its initial statements on Saturday's crash, Boeing offered no immediate insights into the cause.  ""We are aware of media reports from Jakarta regarding Sriwijaya Air flight SJ-182. Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families,"" the US-based planemaker said in a statement.  ""We are in contact with our airline customer and stand ready to support them during this difficult time.""  Indonesia's aviation sector has long suffered from a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane crashed with the loss of 162 lives.   Domestic investigators' final report on the AirAsia crash showed a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance and the pilots' inadequate response were major factors in what was supposed to be a routine flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.  A year later, in 2015, more than 140 people, including people on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/kma   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

At his confirmation hearing, Blinken said he would ""immediately"" review the outgoing Trump administration's labelling of the Iran-linked insurgents, fearing the move was worsening a humanitarian crisis.  ""At least on its surface, (the designation) seems to achieve nothing particularly practical in advancing the efforts against the Huthis and to bring them back to the negotiating table while making it even more difficult than it already is to provide humanitarian assistance to people who desperately need it,"" Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Donald Trump's administration announced the move on January 11, nine days before Biden takes over on Wednesday.  Trump has been a staunch ally of Saudi Arabia, offering US logistical help and military sales for its six-year campaign to dislodge the rebels who have taken over much of the neighbouring country.  Blinken said that the Saudis have ""contributed to what is by most accounts the worst humanitarian situation anywhere in the world"".  ""The Huthis bear significant responsibility for what's happened in Yemen, but the way the campaign has been conducted has also contributed significantly to that situation. And so our support should end,"" Blinken said.  The United Nations and aid groups have warned the terrorist designation risks worsening the plight of a country where millions depend on aid to survive.  The designation took effect Tuesday, with the Huthis warning they would respond to any action against them.  ""We are ready to take all necessary measures against any hostile act,"" they said in a statement.    - Pro-Huthi protest in Sanaa -    On Wednesday, hundreds of supporters of the Huthi rebels took to the streets of the capital Sanaa to protest against the terror designation.  ""We've come out to say the United States is the mother of terrorism and doesn't have the right to classify anyone as terrorist,"" a demonstrator told AFP.  Hizam al-Assad, a member of the Huthis' political office, condemned ""the continued aggression against the Yemeni people by US administrations"".  The designation is expected to halt many transactions with Huthi authorities, including bank transfers and payments to medical personnel and for food and fuel, due to fears of US prosecution.  The US Department of the Treasury, however, has issued humanitarian exemptions under which it would be permissible for aid organisations to deal with the Huthis, according to its website.  The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, responsible for overseas sanctions, had ""issued four general licenses to facilitate the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian assistance and certain other critical commodities to the people of Yemen"".  Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, called on the United States to reverse the Trump administration's move.  ""Our position on this has not changed,"" Dujarric said. ""We call on the government to reverse that decision.""  ""Our concern from the beginning, that we expressed very clearly, is the impact on the commercial sector,"" he said.  ""The vast majority of food and other basic supplies that comes into Yemen comes in through the commercial sector.""  Outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in announcing the designation, pointed to an attack on the airport in Yemen's second city Aden in late December targeting the new Yemeni government that was blamed on the Huthis.  Blinken said the United States remained ""clear-eyed about the Huthis"".  ""They overthrew a government in Yemen, they engaged in a path of aggression through the country, they directed aggression toward Saudi Arabia and committed atrocities and human rights abuses,"" he said. ""And that is a fact.""  But he said that efforts by Pompeo to exempt aid groups were insufficient as they concerned US rather than international groups.  Aid groups fear that they will face legal problems in the United States by interacting with the Huthis, which they say is unavoidable as they are the de facto government in Sanaa and much of Yemen.  bur-sct-gw/hc/dwo",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The country is hoping for an orderly transition of power after almost a decade under two-term President Uhuru Kenyatta, but concerns about vote-rigging linger after past election disputes spiralled into bloodshed.  Deputy President and erstwhile heir apparent William Ruto, 55, is running against Raila Odinga, the 77-year-old veteran opposition leader now backed by longtime rival Kenyatta after a stunning shift in allegiances.  Across the nation, voters lined up well before dawn to cast their ballots in what has been billed as a key test for democracy in a country where ordinary people have increasingly become disenchanted with the political elite.  Many said they hoped it could improve their lives, as they struggle to put food on the table amid soaring inflation and with millions going hungry because of a crippling drought.  By noon, six hours after polling began, turnout was at just over 30 percent of the 22 million registered voters, according to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.  Comparable figures for the August 2017 election were not immediately available but overall turnout then reached 78 percent.  Incidents of delays in opening polling stations and problems with electronic voter registration equipment were reported in several areas.    - Hope for 'transparent' vote -    Pressure is on the IEBC to ensure a free and fair vote in all six polls -- for the presidency as well as for senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  The IEBC -- which has a budget of almost $350 million for the vote -- acknowledged that about 200 electronic devices had failed, out of a total of more than 46,000.    In Wajir, a county on the border with Somalia, a gunfight left election officials trapped inside an office where ballots were stored, and polling has been suspended there, the IEBC said.  Police also fired tear gas after youths blocked a road with burning tyres in Nakuru county in western Kenya after a local vote was suspended.  No presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002, and there will be an anxious wait for this year's results which are not expected for several days.  ""This election is different from the others, it's way (more) calm and peaceful,"" 52-year-old mother of five Joyce Kosgei told AFP in the Rift Valley village where Ruto cast his ballot.  Analysts have suggested that Odinga, a onetime political prisoner and former prime minister who is making his fifth stab at the presidency, could edge past his younger rival.  If neither wins more than 50 percent, Kenya would have to hold a run-off for the first time in its history.  Ruto has painted the election as a battle between ordinary ""hustlers"" and ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  Since neither man belongs to the dominant Kikuyu tribe, which has produced three of the country's four presidents, the election will open a new chapter in Kenya's history.    - 'I want change' -    Kenya's international partners are closely watching the vote in a country deemed a beacon of regional stability.   Both Odinga and Ruto have urged a peaceful election, but fears remain that if the loser challenges the outcome -- as widely expected -- there could be unrest.  Security is tight, with more than 150,000 officers deployed across the country of about 50 million.  The trauma of the 2007 poll, which was followed by politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, runs deep.  Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result that saw then foe Kenyatta re-elected was met with a heavy-handed police response that left dozens dead.  Some observers say economic pressure could vie with tribal allegiance as the big motivator for voters in a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.  Lawyers David Mwaure and George Wajackoyah -- an eccentric former spy who wants to legalise marijuana -- are also standing for president but are likely to trail far behind the frontrunners.  If Odinga wins, his running mate Martha Karua would become deputy president, the first woman to hold the post.  The new president will have to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, youth unemployment, a $70-billion debt mountain and entrenched corruption.  Already battered by the Covid pandemic which threw hundreds of thousands out of work, Kenyans are now suffering from the Ukraine war, which has sent food and fuel prices spiralling.  ""I have come to vote to pick someone who bring change to this country,"" said unemployed 34-year-old Ruth Iminza as she cast her ballot in the Nairobi slum of Kibera.  ""Everything has gone up including school fees for our children.""","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

With Spain still grappling with a third wave of coronavirus infections, the vote in the wealthy northeastern region was held under tight health restrictions to reduce the risk of contagion.  Voters had to wear face maks, use disinfectant gel provided at polling stations and stand apart while lining up in rainy weather to cast their ballots.  To help spread out voters, polling stations were set up in spacious venues such as food markets, the area around FC Barcelona's football stadium and the bullring in Tarragona.  While some 5.5 million people are eligible to vote, as of 6 pm turnout stood at 45.7 percent, compared with 68.2 percent at the same time during the previous election in December 2017.  ""I hesitated until the last minute whether to come vote or not,"" Cristina Caballero, a 34-year-old child educator, told AFP at a Barcelona polling station.  ""I think these elections should have been postponed.""  The regional government tried to put off the elections until the end of May because of the pandemic but the courts blocked that move.  Voting is due to close at 8 pm (1900 GMT), with the final hour reserved for people infected with Covid-19 or undergoing quarantine.   During this time polling staff will wear gloves, facial screens and protective gowns.  While more than 40 percent of the 82,000 people assigned to help staff polling stations on the day had asked to be recused, all polling stations were operating normally as of noon, according to the Catalan government.    - 'Frightening' -    Still, some people tapped for polling station duty expressed concern.  ""Of course we are afraid, I just had cancer and am still on sick leave, but I was called up,"" Eva Vizcaino, a 54-year-old office worker, told AFP at a Barcelona polling station.  ""The last hour is especially frightening, when people with Covid come.""  Results are expected around midnight.  Polls had suggested the Socialists -- who govern at the national level -- were neck-and-neck with the two pro-independence parties that have governed Catalonia together for the past five years.  Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is hoping this election, the fifth in a decade, will end their rule.  He took part in several rallies to support the Socialists' top candidate, former health minister Salvador Illa, who enjoyed high visibility because of his handling of the coronavirus crisis.    - Separatist battle -    But even if Illa's Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) comes out on top, polls suggest separatist parties together could once again manage a ruling majority despite deep divisions since the failed 2017 independence bid.  If that happens, it would be a repeat of the last election in December 2017 when the stridently pro-unity Ciudadanos won the most seats but was unable to form a government.  The main question then is which of Catalonia's two main separatist parties will come out stronger -- the hardline JxC -- ""Together for Catalonia"" -- or the more moderate ERC.  In the December 2017 election, JxC was ahead, forming a 66-seat coalition with ERC.  If the tables are turned in ERC's favour, it would likely ease tensions and facilitate the tentative reconciliation that Sanchez's government has sought to broker since coming to power.   Sanchez came to lead Spain's government in 2018 thanks in part to support from Catalan separatists, and his minority government relies on them to pass legislation.  ""An ERC executive would maintain the current ambiguous approach of criticising Madrid rhetorically but not adopting any unilateral measures,"" said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at political consultancy Teneo.  ""In contrast, a government headed by JxC would probably lead to a more confrontational stance.""  dbh/ds/gd",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48838589']

Russia's burgeoning protest movement in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has seen demonstrators get creative.   Here's a rundown of some bizarre memes and symbols from recent anti-government demonstrations.    - Blue underwear -         Since December Russian protesters have hung blue boxer shorts on street signs, posted pictures clad in just blue underwear and held them at protests, in reference to how the country's best-known opposition figure claims he was poisoned.  Navalny, who suffered an attack with the Novichok nerve agent in August, says agents from the Federal Security Services (FSB) placed the toxin in the lining of his blue underwear.  When President Vladimir Putin marked the Orthodox ritual celebrating the baptism of Jesus Christ this month by dunking himself in ice-cold water wearing blue swimming trunks, Navalny's allies joked that Putin was sporting his top opponent's undergarments.    - Toilet brushes -    After spending five months in Germany recovering from the poisoning, Navalny returned to Russia this month and was immediately detained.   The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner called for mass rallies, spurring on the protests by releasing an investigation into a lavish property on Russia's Black Sea coast that he alleged is owned by Putin.  The complex, which Navalny says cost more than $1.35 billion, allegedly features everything from an underground ice rink to a casino.  But what stuck out to the Russian opposition was the reported cost of a high-end toilet brush: 700 euros. Several protesters brought what appeared to be considerably cheaper versions to Saturday's rallies.     - Snow tools -     At the demonstrations in Moscow, protesters pelted riot police and even a car that reportedly belonged to the FSB with snowballs.  They also wrote their demands, including ""Free Navalny"", on a snow-covered wall, which a police officer was filmed immediately wiping away.   But the action at times grew violent, with protesters cracking a window of the reported FSB car and the TASS news agency reporting that snowball-throwers damaged the driver's eyesight.  Observers expect authorities to crack down hard on at least several of those who participated.  After protests for fair elections in Moscow in the summer of 2019, courts jailed demonstrators for assaulting law enforcement officials, including one who allegedly tossed a plastic cup at an officer.  In Tarusa south of Moscow, three people were detained for building two snowmen, one of which was photographed holding a sign that read: ""Freedom. Truth. Russia"".    - A meme movement -    Many of the demonstrators expected they would face consequences for attending the rallies, which saw some 3,500 people detained nationwide.   On TikTok, the video-sharing app popular with teenagers, users shared videos preparing for the protests with a song featuring the lyrics: ""I will get jailed"".  The power of the internet was visible at the rallies in other ways too.  One viral photo from over the weekend was of police detaining Russia's own version of the so-called ""Q Shaman"": a man wearing a fur headdress with horns.  emg/jbr/wdb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105137806']

Almost a year after the United States registered its first Covid-19 death, the pace of the pandemic has picked up with 100,000 deaths in the past month alone, adding to a national toll far above any other country.  ""It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" Biden said in somber remarks in Washington at the National Mall reflecting pool, where lights were turned on as a memorial to those who have died.  ""Let us shine the lights in the darkness along the sacred pool of reflection and remember all who we lost,"" said Biden.  The arrival of mass vaccination campaigns in the United States and Europe had brought hope that the end of the epidemic was in sight, and the European Union said Tuesday it was aiming to inoculate 70 percent of its adult population before the end of August.  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said meeting the target could be ""a turning point"" in the fight against the virus.  But many EU countries -- and other nations including India and Russia -- have struggled to get their inoculation programmes off the ground.  As nations grapple with the health crisis, several inquiries have re-energised questions over the origins of the virus in China in late 2019, and how the authorities handled it.  Beijing has been accused of stifling whistleblowers who tried to raise the alarm, and experts said this week that officials could have reacted quicker to avert catastrophe.  Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed the criticism, saying: ""As the first country to sound the alarm against the pandemic, we took prompt and decisive measures even though we had incomplete information at the time.""    - Travel ban row -    Biden has made tackling the pandemic his top priority, as he prepares to take office on Wednesday.  He is already being forced to take action, with his aides contradicting an order from outgoing President Donald Trump to lift travel bans designed to stop the spread.  ""With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,"" tweeted Jen Psaki, Biden's press secretary.  Caution was in evidence too in Taiwan, which called off its largest Lunar New Year lantern festival for the first time as authorities rushed to stem a Covid cluster in one of the few places to survive the pandemic largely unscathed.  In Africa, Rwanda's capital Kigali was back under total lockdown after a surge in cases.    - Vaccine queue-jumping? -    Britain has been coping with a new strain of the virus thought to be far more infectious, and on Tuesday it registered a record 1,610 deaths over 24 hours.  There was, however, a sign of hope for Britain as the number of new cases over a week was down about 22 percent following a stringent lockdown announced this month.  More than four million people in Britain have been vaccinated so far.  As fears of new variants spread, Portugal also clocked a record daily number of fatalities and Germany tightened and extended its partial lockdown until mid-February.  Elsewhere in Europe, Serbia became the first European country to use the Chinese-made Sinopharm jab, while Austrian authorities were looking into reports of alleged queue-jumping for vaccines, including by several mayors.  In hard-hit South America, Argentina began administering second doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine as Chile started a campaign to immunize its general population.  Israel extended its lockdown to the end of the month after a spike in infections.    - Holy scam -    The pandemic continued to batter the world of sport, forcing postponements and the quarantining of players.  Health officials said two Australian Open tennis players have tested positive -- a new blow for the tournament facing a backlash from a wary public.  The unnamed players were among three new cases, taking the tournament's cluster to seven.  More than 1,000 players and staff are in quarantine after arriving last week in Australia, which is largely coronavirus-free.  Player complaints about quarantine have raised further hackles, and Australia's Nick Kyrgios led criticism of world number one Novak Djokovic for requesting improved conditions.  ""Djokovic is a tool,"" tweeted Kyrgios, the world number 47.  Van Morrison's lawyer, meanwhile, announced the music legend would challenge the Northern Irish government in court over its ""blanket ban"" on live music in licensed venues arising from coronavirus restrictions.  In Sri Lanka, another example of the quack cures and false claims that have proliferated in connection with the virus was shown to be dangerously false.  A self-styled holy man's supposed miracle potion to prevent Covid-19 turned sour after a minister who publicly drank it was hospitalised with the virus.  Thousands defied public gathering restrictions to swamp a village in central Sri Lanka last month to get the syrup made by Dhammika Bandara.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

On the eve of Biden's inauguration, Blinken was set to say at his confirmation hearing that the United States will seek to remain the pre-eminent global power but renew cooperation on common challenges such as Covid-19 and climate change.  ""America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the greater good,"" Blinken, a mild-mannered longtime aide to Biden, was to tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to his prepared remarks.   ""We can outcompete China -- and remind the world that a government of the people, by the people, can deliver for its people,"" Blinken said, paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln's paean to democracy two weeks after a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol in hopes of overturning Biden's victory.  The stepson of a Holocaust survivor who found refuge in the United States, Blinken, 58, is known for his passion on humanitarian causes.  He is expected to win Senate confirmation although Republicans have vowed to press him hard on his consulting work since leaving Barack Obama's administration four years ago.  In a sharp shift in tone from Trump's secretary of state Mike Pompeo -- who spoke of ""swagger,"" ""American exceptionalism"" and global conflict with China -- Blinken said he would show ""humility.""  ""Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone -- even one as powerful as the US,"" Blinken said.   ""We can revitalize our core alliances - force multipliers of our influence around the world. Together, we are far better positioned to counter threats posed by Russia, Iran, and North Korea and to stand up for democracy and human rights.""    - Quick reversals from Trump -    Biden has promised to move swiftly after his inauguration at noon (1700 GMT) Wednesday to reverse some of Trump's most divisive policies.  Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris climate accord, reverse the US exit from the World Health Organization and end immigration agents' draconian separations of Latin American children from their families.  With the French-speaking Blinken as his top diplomat, Biden will want to repair rifts with Western allies that turned intensely personal under Trump, who shattered protocol by publicly assailing his counterparts.  Biden is expected to seek a return to the Iran nuclear accord negotiated under Obama, believing that Trump's exit and imposition of sanctions backfired badly with Tehran escalating its contested program.  Biden also faces an immediate deadline with the February 5 expiration of the New START treaty on nuclear reduction, the last remaining arms pact with Russia.  Fellow Democrats have urged Biden to temporarily extend the treaty, an option supported by Moscow, after the Trump administration unsuccessfully sought to expand New START by bringing in China.  In its final days, the Trump administration has taken a slew of major decisions seen as attempting to box in the next team.  Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, has criticized one such move -- designating Yemen's Iranian-aligned Huthi rebels as terrorists, a step that aid groups warn will worsen a humanitarian crisis.  Pompeo in his final days also redesignated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, a move that will play to Trump's Cuban-American supporters but could require months to undo.    - US permanently scarred? -    With the world's eyes on the Capitol steps, new presidents have seized on inaugural addresses to make soaring statements of US international purpose, from John F. Kennedy's Cold War warning of a ""long twilight struggle"" to Obama's offer to adversaries ""to extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.""  Biden's inauguration will take place in a far darker atmosphere with virtually no crowd -- due both to the pandemic that has claimed two million lives worldwide and ultra-tight security after the pro-Trump mob's January 6 attack on the very building where Biden will take the oath.  ""America's image is irreversibly harmed. The most Biden can do is hope to patch up a few potholes and hope it will be a bit less of a bumpy ride,"" said Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat who heads the Global Situation Room consulting firm.  Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the political violence ""should put an end to the notion of American exceptionalism.""  ""A post-American world, one no longer defined by US primacy, is coming sooner than generally expected -- less because of the inevitable rise of others than because of what the United States has done to itself,"" Haass wrote in Foreign Affairs.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Guterres made the comments during a special meeting of the UN Security Council in New York to mark the anniversary of Russia's invasion of its neighbor on February 24.  The UN chief described the six months of conflict as ""devastating,"" adding that he remained ""gravely concerned"" about military activity around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, Europe's largest atomic power plant.  ""The warning lights are flashing,"" he said.  ""Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction. The security of the plant must be ensured, and the plant must be re-established as purely civilian infrastructure,"" he added.  The plant is occupied by Russian troops and threatened by shelling, which Moscow blames on Kyiv.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, addressing the meeting via video link, told the UN that Russia ""should unconditionally stop nuclear blackmail"" and ""completely withdraw"" from the plant.   ""Europe and neighboring regions face the threat of the radiation pollution. This is a fact,"" Zelensky told the session, which had been requested by the United States, France and Britain.  Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, objected to Zelensky being allowed to speak.  He said he was not opposed to the Ukrainian leader's participation, but to the fact that he was not attending in person.  The 15-member council voted 13 to one in favor of allowing Zelensky to speak, with China abstaining.  After the meeting, some 50 countries, including the United States, Japan, Britain and France released a joint statement repeating their demand for an immediate cessation of hostilities.  During the session, Nebenzia denounced ""mantras about Russian aggression.""  ""No one is arguing that it is difficult for Ukrainians today,"" he said.   ""However, responsibility for this lies with the Kiev regime... (which) has been steadily leading the country to disaster, choosing the path of Russophobia and the glorification of Nazi criminals,"" Nebenzia added.  Guterres -- back from a recent trip to Ukraine and Turkey that focused on grain exports, which have resumed following an agreement in July -- warned of the continuing threat to food and fuel security.  ""The consequences of this senseless war are being felt far beyond Ukraine,"" he said.

""We certainly urge all sides to avoid further escalation... We absolutely fully support Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist groups that are taking the lives of innocent civilians in Israel,"" he said.    - Russia -    Russia, whose ties with Israel have been tested by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, appeared to pin initial blame on the Jewish state.  ""We are observing with profound worry how events are evolving,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, adding that Moscow was calling ""on all the parties involved to show maximum restraint"".  ""The new escalation was caused by Israeli army firing into the Gaza Strip on August 5, to which Palestinian groups responded by carrying out massive and indiscriminate bombardments on Israeli territory,"" she said.    - Britain -    Britain called for ""a swift end to the violence"", while reasserting its support of Israel.  ""The UK stands by Israel and its right to defend itself,"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted.  ""We condemn terrorist groups firing at civilians and violence which has resulted in casualties on both sides.""  Health authorities in the Palestinian enclave have said a five-year-old girl was among 15 people killed in Israeli bombardment.  No deaths have been reported on the Israeli side.    - European Union -    The EU called for maximum restraint, as Israel warned Saturday that its air strikes could last a week and as cross-border fire reverberated for a second day, in the worst escalation since the last Gaza war in 2021.  ""The European Union follows with great concern the latest developments in and around Gaza,"" a spokesman for the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.  ""The EU calls for maximum restraint on all sides... While Israel has the right to protect its civilian population, everything must be done to prevent a broader conflict,"" he said.    - United Nations -    UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was ""deeply concerned"", warning that the escalation was ""very dangerous"".    - Egypt -    Egypt, historically a broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, has reportedly been seeking to mediate and may host a delegation from Islamic Jihad over the weekend.  The militant group has been firing rockets from Gaza after one of its commanders was killed in an Israeli strike on Friday.      - Arab League -    The Arab League ""condemned in the strongest possible terms the ferocious Israeli aggression against Gaza"".    - Jordan -    Jordan's foreign ministry has ""stressed the importance of halting the Israeli aggression"".    - Iran -    Iran, a supporter of Gaza militants, said the territory was ""not alone"" in its fight.  ""We are with you on this path until the end, and let Palestine and the Palestinians know that they are not alone,"" Iran's Revolutionary Guards chief Major General Hossein Salami told Islamic Jihad leader Ziad al-Nakhala during a meeting in Tehran.    - Football friendly called off -    The violence has also affected the sporting scene in Israel, where sirens blared to warn of incoming rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.  A pre-season friendly between Spanish side Atletico Madrid and Italian giants Juventus that had been scheduled to take place in Tel Aviv on Sunday was cancelled because of ""security"" concerns, the two teams announced.  burs/hc/lg   JUVENTUS FOOTBALL CLUB",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The statement came shortly after Biden announced that the United States had killed Zawahiri, one of the world's most-wanted terrorists and a mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks, in a drone strike in Kabul.

""We won 30 departments"" out of the 46 in the west African country and overseas constituencies, Aminata Toure, head of the presidential coalition, told reporters late Sunday.  ""This undoubtedly gives us a majority in the National Assembly.""   ""We have given a majority in the National Assembly to our coalition president,"" Sall, she added, without giving the number of seats won by her camp or whether it was an absolute or relative majority.  Toure however acknowledged her coalition had been defeated in the capital, Dakar.  But on Monday the main opposition coalition expressed ""astonishment"" at Toure's remarks, claiming the presidential camp was ""looking to once again confiscate the vote by the Senegalese who have just given a comfortable majority in the National Assembly to the Yewwi Wallu inter-coalition"".  It also failed to specify the number of seats or what kind of majority it was claiming.  ""We call on national and international opinion to act as witnesses against any attempt to manipulate the results,"" the opposition said in a statement.  The opposition had hoped the elections would impose a cohabitation, or divided government, on Sall and curb any ambitions he may have for a third term.  Sunday's polls were an important test for Sall after local elections in March saw the opposition win in major cities, including Dakar, Ziguinchor in the south and Thies in the west.  Initial indications were that the poll was close and that the main opposition coalition gained ground, particularly in urban areas, according to local media.    - Opposition collaboration -    The single round of voting will decide the 165 seats of the single-chamber parliament -- currently controlled by the president's supporters -- for the next five years.  Sall has promised to appoint a prime minister -- a position he abolished and then restored in December 2021 -- from the winning camp.  Some seven million Senegalese were eligible to vote in the election, which passed without any major incidents.  Turnout at several polling stations appeared relatively low, according to AFP correspondents and observers, and the interior ministry said the participation rate was 47 percent.  Provisional overall results are expected no later than Friday, but local media and the main political parties have been counting some of the results since Sunday evening.  ""I hope... there are no disputes,"" said Lamine Sylva, a 60-year-old artist who voted at a school in Mbao, near Dakar.  ""It's like football -- there is a winner and a loser.""  Yahya Sall, a retired soldier, said he hoped the new parliament ""will have a strong opposition presence... to advance democracy"".  The national election commission has deployed 22,000 observers nationwide. Experts from the regional ECOWAS bloc were also present.  Lawmakers are elected according to a system that combines proportional representation, with national lists for 53 lawmakers, and majority voting in the country's departments for 97 others.  The diaspora elects the remaining 15 members of parliament.  This year, eight coalitions are in the running, including Yewwi Askan Wi (""Liberate the People"" in Wolof), the main opposition coalition headed by former presidential candidate Ousmane Sonko, who came third in the 2019 presidential election.  Ahead of the poll, Yewwi Askan Wi joined forces with Wallu Senegal (""Save Senegal""), led by former president Abdoulaye Wade.  The two groups agreed to work together to obtain a parliamentary majority and ""force governmental cohabitation"".    - Rising prices -    The vote took place against a backdrop of rising prices, partly because of the Ukraine war.  The opposition has questioned the priorities of the government, which has highlighted its subsidies for oil products and food as well as infrastructure building.   ""Is the priority of the Senegalese to build beautiful stadiums, new highways while people are not eating?"" Sonko said after casting his ballot in Ziguinchor.  Sall, 60, was elected in 2012 for seven years then re-elected in 2019 for another five. He has been accused of wanting to break the two-term limit and run again in 2024.  He has remained vague on the subject, but any defeat of his supporters in Sunday's vote could upset such plans.  The 21-day election campaign passed in a mostly calm atmosphere.  The pre-campaign period, however, was marked by violent demonstrations that left at least three people dead after several members of the main opposition coalition, including Sonko, were banned from taking part.  On June 29, the opposition eased tensions by agreeing to take part in the elections, which it had threatened to boycott.  mrb-amt/pvh/mtp-kjm/imm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84036241']

On Wednesday at noon, Biden will be sworn in and the Trump presidency will end, turning the page on some of the most disruptive, divisive years the United States has seen since the 1960s.  Biden, a veteran Democratic senator who also served as vice president to Barack Obama, was set to travel to Washington on Tuesday with his wife Dr Jill Biden from their hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.  Together with incoming vice president Kamala Harris -- the first woman ever to hold the job -- Biden was due to deliver an evening address on the Covid-19 crisis, from the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool.  By contrast, Trump has remained uncharacteristically silent as the clock ticks down to his departure to a new life in his Mar-a-Lago golf club residence in Palm Beach.  Banned by Twitter for his stream of inflammatory messages and misinformation, he has largely stopped communicating with the nation. He has also yet to congratulate Biden or invite him for the traditional pre-inauguration cup of tea in the Oval Office.  Instead, Trump has spent his time meeting with a dwindling circle of loyalists who backed him during a doomed, two-month effort to overturn the results of the November election.  That effort culminated on January 6 with Trump encouraging a crowd to march on Congress.  After the crowd broke through police, killing one officer, and trashed the hallowed Capitol building, Trump was impeached for the second time in just over a year -- another first in a presidency of many firsts.  His final Gallup poll as president on Monday showed him exiting with 34 percent approval, his record low. Trump's overall average of 41 percent since taking office is also the lowest for any presidency's approval rating since Gallup began measuring in 1938.  Biden, meanwhile, is putting the finishing touches to an inauguration that will feature a small crowd and massive security -- more fallout from the pro-Trump riot, on top of existing concerns about Covid-19.    - Pardons -    Trump issued a scattering of last-minute orders on Monday, most notably a lifting of the travel bans imposed because of the coronavirus on most of Europe and Brazil.  Under Trump's order, borders were to have reopened from January 26, almost a week after he leaves office. Responding almost immediately, Biden's spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the measure would not stand.  For Trump, the main piece of unfinished business is now the expected slew of pardons that he is reported to be preparing.  According to CNN and other US outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he will grant clemency to.  After what The New York Times reports has been an intense lobbying effort, these are expected to be a mix of white-collar criminals and people whose cases have been championed by criminal justice activists.  More controversial possible pardons that have been the subject of speculation for months would be for the likes of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Trump's influential advisor Stephen Bannon.  If Trump gave himself or his family a pardon -- something currently not expected, according to latest US reports -- that would likely harden anger among previously fully supportive Republicans in the Senate, which is expected to start an impeachment trial soon after Biden takes office.    - Unity and fear -    Biden's inaugural speech is expected to focus on his appeals for Americans to reunite and to take on the Covid-19 pandemic with new seriousness.  He is also set to announce a dramatic shift away from Trump's ""America First"" ideology, taking the United States back to its traditions of alliance-building. This will begin with the new president ordering the United States back into the Paris climate accord on day one.  But the 78-year-old Democrat's fervent appeals for optimism and healing are running up against the hard reality of multiple crises.  Covid-19 is out of control, vaccine distribution is stumbling, and economic recovery remains in the balance. And after Trump's refusal to accept the results of November's presidential election, the country is seething.  Biden will take the oath of office on the steps of the Capitol under the protection of more than 20,000 National Guard soldiers. Checkpoints and large zones closed to ordinary citizens mean there will be only a smattering of guests.  The acting defense secretary said Monday that the military and FBI were vetting the National Guard troopers, who carry automatic weapons, in case any of them pose a threat.    - Inauguration snub -    Trump, the first president to lose reelection since George H.W. Bush was replaced by Bill Clinton, will also be the first ex-president to snub his successor's inauguration in a century and a half.  On Wednesday, he will depart for Florida from the White House early, in order to benefit from full presidential travel privileges up to the last minute.  Marine One will take him from the White House to Joint Base Andrews to catch Air Force One -- the presidential plane that, from noon, will no longer be his to use.  According to a Bloomberg report, Trump is organizing a military sendoff for himself at Andrews, watched by a crowd of invitees.  sms/jh/leg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

""It's a move behind Europe's back,"" he said, calling it an ""anti-EU project that may soon serve Russia's aggressive policies"".  ""It increases EU dependency, undermines economy & safety.

Speaking last weekend to the daily Rheinische Post about the pipeline, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said 20 million Soviet citizens were killed following Nazi Germany's invasion of the USSR in 1941.  The ""terrible bloodshed"" did not ""justify any mistakes in our policies towards Russia today, but we must not lose sight of the bigger picture,"" he said.  The comments have already drawn criticism from Ukraine, which will lose transit fee revenues as a result of Nord Stream 2, a 10-billion-euro ($11-billion) gas pipeline running under the Baltic Sea.  The United States and several European countries have criticised the project, saying it will increase German and EU dependence on Russia.

Washington was under unprecedented security lockdown, cheering crowds absent because of America's out-of-control Covid outbreak and Donald Trump had only left the White House hours before.  Biden's armored black limousine had deposited him at the end of his new street -- Pennsylvania Avenue -- after his swearing in and a visit to Arlington National Cemetery to pay respects to US military war dead.   But he popped the surreality of the moment with a quip as he made the short walk to the White House with Jill, followed closely by Vice President Kamala Harris and her family.  ""It feels like I'm going home,"" the president told an NBC News reporter, who was among the dozens of journalists recording each step from a grandstand.  The sound of military marching bands was still hanging in the air while a group of Secret Service agents in long coats scanned the scene.  Until shortly before his arrival, red dump trucks with ""God Bless America"" emblazoned on their sides served as security barriers to Pennsylvania Avenue.  It betrayed the overwhelming security machine for Biden's extraordinary day, including miles of metal barriers, thousands of masked security forces and a dystopian-looking Washington that would normally be primed to party on Inauguration Day.  The lockdown meant the contingent of roughly 25,000 National Guard troops far outnumbered revellers.  ""This looks like the entrance to a military base... during war,"" said 42-year-old Joe Brunner from New York City, as he stood across from a checkpoint guarded by armed troops and military vehicles in central Washington.  ""The atmosphere is very strange, it is very un-American"", said 36-year-old Jason Sheffield, adding the security zone and heavy police presence ""is unethical to freedom"" and ""very scary.""  For most Americans, the inauguration was watched on social media and TV.  Streets were nearly empty and many businesses in downtown Washington were boarded up, some due to the pandemic and others because of recent violent protests.  In recent years, tens of thousands of people have been close enough to the inauguration ceremony to see the president take the oath of office at the great domed Capitol building that hosts Congress.  The crowd has been massively pared down due to virus contagion concerns -- normally 200,000 passes would be distributed among lawmakers to hand out to their constituents.  This year it was one ticket for each of the 535 members of Congress and one guest each.  On top of that, Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol building two weeks ago to try to undo Biden's election win, prompting extra heavy security.  The number of National Guard troops -- which is on top of thousands of police officers -- is about three times the roughly 8,000 on hand for Trump's inauguration.  Those troops would, outside a pandemic year, be guarding crowds on the Capitol grounds and many thousands more packing the roughly 700-acre (280-hectare) National Mall.   The 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama, America's first Black president, drew an estimated 450,000 spectators to the Mall.  Yet some people defied the warnings and strolled the car-less streets to see what they could of America's handover of power.  ""I think today is kind of joyous,"" said downtown Washington resident Sheila Callahan.   ""As soon as Trump's helicopter took off from the White House, people (in her neighborhood) were up on the roof cheering.""  cyj-jm/wat",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The blaze, blamed on an electrical fault, hit the Abu Sifin church in densely populated Imbaba, a working class district west of the Nile River, part of Giza governorate in greater Cairo.   Hundreds gathered to pay their respects in and around the two Giza churches where clergymen prayed for the victims, according to AFP correspondents.  Pallbearers pushed through crowds of weeping mourners who reached for the coffins, including that of a priest at the church, Father Abdel-Messih Bekhit.  The Egyptian Coptic Church and the health ministry reported 41 dead and 14 injured in the blaze before emergency services brought it under control.  Witnesses to the fire Sunday morning described people rushing into the multi-storey house of worship to rescue those trapped but the rescuers were soon overwhelmed by heat and deadly smoke.  Copts are the largest Christian community in the Middle East, making up at least 10 million of Egypt's 103 million Muslim-majority population.    - Power surge -    ""Everyone was carrying kids out of the building,"" said Ahmed Reda Baioumy, who lives next to the church. ""But the fire was getting bigger and you could only go in once or you would asphyxiate.""  Another witness, Sayed Tawfik, told AFP that ""some threw themselves out of windows to escape the fire"". He pointed to a car bearing dents ""left by a person who is now lying in the hospital with a broken arm and back"".  A resident of the area, Mina Masry, said emergency services were slow in responding. Ambulances took ""over an hour to arrive"" and fire trucks ""nearly an hour, though their station is five minutes away"".  ""If the ambulances had come on time, they could have rescued people,"" Masry added.   A statement from the public prosecutor's office indicated that asphyxiation caused the deaths, as there were ""no visible injuries"".   The interior ministry said ""forensic evidence revealed that the blaze broke out in an air-conditioning unit on the second floor of the church building"" which also houses social services.  Father Farid Fahmy, of another nearby church, told AFP a short circuit caused the fire.  ""The power was out and they were using a generator,"" he said. ""When the power came back, it caused an overload.""  In the morning, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on his Facebook page that he had ""mobilised all state services"" in response. He later said he had ""presented his condolences by phone"" to Pope Tawadros II, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church.  He also directed the Armed Forces Engineering Authority to ""take over the reconstruction and renovation"" of the church, the presidency said in a statement.    - Religious minority -    Christian communities often complain that reconstruction of churches after devastating fires is marked by long delays and bureaucratic hurdles.  Giza's governor ordered ""urgent aid of 50,000 pounds (around $2,600) for the families of the deceased and 10,000 pounds for the injured"".  The grand imam of Al-Azhar, Egypt's foremost Muslim institution, expressed his condolences for ""the tragic accident"" and affirmed ""the readiness of Al-Azhar hospitals to receive the injured"".  Accidental fires are not uncommon in the sprawling megalopolis of Cairo, where millions live in informal settlements.   Baioumy, the neighbour, told AFP that firefighters were hampered by the church's location ""on a very narrow street"".  Egypt, with its often dilapidated and poorly maintained infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.  The Coptic minority has endured attacks and complained of discrimination in the north African country, the Arab world's most populous.  Copts have been targeted in deadly attacks by Islamist militants, particularly after Sisi overthrew former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, with churches, schools and homes burnt down.   Copts also complain they have been left out of key state positions and they have deplored restrictive legislation for the construction and renovation of churches.   Sisi, the first Egyptian president to attend the Coptic Christmas mass every year, in February appointed the first ever Coptic judge to head the Supreme Constitutional Court, the country's highest.  sar/sbh/bha/jsa   Meta",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113514635']

Emergency workers have been trying to clear the debris of a gun and bomb attack by the Al-Qaeda-linked group on the popular Hayat hotel which left parts of the building in ruins, with many feared trapped inside the venue.  ""The ministry of health has so far confirmed the deaths of 21 people and 117 people wounded"" in the assault that began on Friday evening and lasted over a day, Adan said.   On Sunday morning, the area surrounding the hotel was quiet and the roads blocked by a heavy security presence as emergency workers and bomb disposal experts sought to clear the premises of any explosives and remove rubble.  The hotel building sustained heavy damage during the gunfight between Somali forces and the insurgent.  It caused some parts of it to collapse and leaving many people frantically searching for their loved ones who were inside when the attack began.  Police commissioner Abdi Hassan Mohamed Hijar told reporters on Sunday that ""106 people including children and women"" were rescued by security forces during the siege which ended around midnight.  As bullets and flames ripped through the hotel, security forces searched the property to bring civilians to safety, including three young children who hid inside a toilet.  ""The casualties mostly happened in the early hours of the attack, after that security forces spent time rescuing people individually and room by room,"" Hijar said.  The attack was the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June, and underscored the challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist group.    - 'Tense' -    Dozens of people gathered near the road leading up to the hotel on Sunday morning, desperate for news of their family members as security forces guarded the area, not letting anyone through.  Businessman Muktar Adan, whose brother was inside the hotel when the attack started, told AFP he was waiting for permission to enter the premises and look for his sibling.  ""My brother was inside the hotel the last time we heard from him, but his phone is switched off now and we don't know what to expect,"" he said.  Said Nurow, who heard the attack unfold, said he was very worried about his friend who was a guest at the property.  ""I hope... (he) is alive, he stayed in the hotel according to the last information we got from his sister,"" he told AFP, describing the mood as ""tense"".  The hotel was a favoured meeting spot for government officials and scores of people were inside when gunmen stormed the property.   Somalia's allies, including the United States, Britain and Turkey, as well as the UN, have strongly condemned the attack. So did ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  Earlier this month, Washington announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - Twin explosions -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  According to police, the attack began with a blast caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel along with gunmen.  Minutes later, a second explosion struck as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to help the injured, witnesses said.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  Al-Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office, and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopian border.  The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, but still control swathes of countryside and retain the ability to launch deadly strikes, often targeting hotels and restaurants.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  str-amu/ach/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

At least 13 civilians have been killed and dozens wounded since militants from the Al-Qaeda affiliate unleashed a gun and bomb attack on the popular Hayat Hotel on Friday evening, according to Somali officials.   ""The security forces have ended the siege now and the gunmen are dead, we've had no incoming gunfire from the building in the past hour,"" the commander told AFP on condition of anonymity.  He gave no further information about the total number of civilian or security casualties or how many Al-Shabaab fighters had been killed, saying the government would give a press briefing on Sunday morning.  The building still needed to be cleared of any explosives that may have been planted, he added.  This was the biggest attack in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June and underscores the huge challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist militant group.  The hotel, a popular spot for government officials, has been destroyed after security forces pounded it with heavy weapons late Saturday in a bid to eliminate the assailants who were holed up there for a second straight night.  Witnesses watching the drama unfold from the rooftop of another building said they saw flames tear through the hotel during the bombardment by security forces, with heavy explosions and gunfire reported.  Scores of people were trapped when the assault began and although officials said dozens had been rescued, including children, it is not known how were still inside when the siege ended.  Al-Shabaab, which has carried out numerous deadly attacks in its war against the fragile government in the Horn of Africa nation, has claimed responsibility.   Security official Mohamed Abdikadir had told AFP earlier the number of civilians confirmed to have died was 13, while police officer Ibrahim Duale put the toll at more than 10.  The director of Mogadishu's main trauma hospital, Mohamed Abdirahman Jama, said it was treating at least 40 people wounded in the hotel attack and a separate mortar strike on a seaside area, Hamar Jajab.  ""Among those critically wounded are a newlywed bride and her groom and a family of three children, a mother and their father,"" Hamar Jajab district commissioner Mucawiye Muddey told AFP.    - Children found hiding in toilet -     One woman, Hayat Ali, said three young relatives aged between four and seven were found by security forces hiding in a hotel toilet in a state of shock but were later reunited with their family.  Another survivor told AFP he and some colleagues had performed evening prayers before taking tea in one of the hotel's open spaces when they heard the first explosions Friday, the start of the weekend in the mainly Muslim country.  ""I managed to run to a nearby exit gate away from the gunmen,"" Hussein Ali said. ""The gunmen started firing and I could hear the shots behind me, but thanks to God... we managed to escape.""  Somalia's allies including the United States, Britain and Turkey as well as the UN have strongly condemned the attack, as has ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  Witnesses had reported at least two powerful explosions on Friday as gunmen burst into the hotel. Police said the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with other gunmen.  A second explosion occurred just minutes later, witnesses said, inflicting more casualties as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to the scene.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces were still in control of the building and that they had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  In a statement by the group's news agency cited by the SITE Intelligence monitoring group, the jihadists claimed to have held hostages during the siege including government and security officials.      Al-Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopia border.  Earlier this week, the United States announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - Decades of chaos -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Al-Shabaab was driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 by AU forces, but still controls swathes of countryside and is able to launch deadly strikes on political, civilian and military targets, with hotels and restaurants often hit.  Earlier this month, Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre appointed the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow defected from Al-Shabaab in 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5 million bounty for his capture.  Somalia has been mired in chaos since the fall of president Siad Barre's military regime in 1991, with civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.

The company said that it had signed a deal on Friday with its local Russian partner Novatek to sell its 49 percent in the Termokarstovoye gas field ""on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field.""  It said the divestment had been agreed in July and submitted to Russian authorities in early August, with approval coming on August 25.  That was the day after an article appeared in French daily Le Monde reporting the alleged refining of natural gas condensates from Termokarstovoye into jet fuel for fighter-bombers involved in Russia's assault on Ukraine since February.  TotalEnergies -- formerly Total -- owns 49 percent of Terneftegaz, the company that extracts gas from the Termokarstovoye field.  The other 51 percent is held by Novatek, in which the French firm also holds a 19.4 percent stake.  TotalEnergies initially said it had no control over the sales of its Russian partner.  On Friday, it said Novatek had denied that its condensates were being refined into Russian military jet fuel.  Instead, they were sent to processing at a refinery whose products are exclusively exported outside Russia, a Novatek statement relayed by the French firm said.  TotalEnergies also said it was considering legal action in a bid to end an ""unfounded controversy which is damaging the reputation of the company.""  ""We are grateful to (French President) Emmanuel Macron and the French people for supporting Ukraine. Against this background, it is a disgrace to France when French companies assist the murder of Ukrainians and the ruining of our cities,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Friday.  ""TotalEnergies, pull out of Russia!""    - 'Exclusively exported' fuel -    Le Monde reported Wednesday that condensates from Termokarstovoye were being sent to a refinery that had provided 42,700 tonnes of fuel from February-July sent to airbases hosting Russian planes.  They accounted for more than eight percent of the raw materials received at the refinery in Omsk since the invasion of Ukraine, it added.  Citing data from financial information firm Refinitiv, the newspaper said the jet fuel shipments could be tracked back to the by-products from Termokarstovoye.  Novatek said via TotalEnergies that all condensates from the gas field are ""delivered to the Ust-Luga processing complex in the Leningrad region.  ""The range of products derived during processing at the Ust-Luga complex includes jet fuel that is exclusively exported outside Russia, and it does not even have the certification to be sold inside the country"".  TotalEnergies is the only major Western energy group to continue its operations in Russia, which accounts for 16.6 percent of its hydrocarbon production and 30 percent of its gas.  Chief executive Patrick Pouyanne had said in March that Russian gas fields exploited by the company's joint ventures ""are going to operate whether I leave or not"" and are vital for supplying energy to Europe.  Selling TotalEnergies' assets at knock-down prices would amount to handing billions to Russian investors, he argued.  But the firm has since announced a partial withdrawal from Russia, including stopping financing the Arctic LNG 2 gas project.  In July, it sold its 20-percent stake in an Arctic oil field to Russia's Zarubejneft.  mdz-adp/tgb/cdw   TOTALENERGIES    NOVATEK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Here is some background on the Al-Qaeda affiliate which has been fighting to overthrow the weak central government in Mogadishu for more than 15 years.      - Al-Qaeda links -    Al-Shabaab emerged from Somalia's Islamic Courts Union that controlled central and southern Somalia for six months in 2006 before being ousted by Ethiopian troops.  The group, which advocates a strict version of sharia or Islamic law, declared its allegiance to Al-Qaeda and was officially integrated in 2012. It was designated a ""foreign terrorist organisation"" by the US State Department in 2008.  Ahmed Diriye became the new ""emir"" after the killing of Ahmed Abdi Godane in a US strike in September 2014. Diriye, also known as Ahmed Umar and Abu Ubaidah, has a $6-million US bounty on his head.   Al-Shabaab fighters were chased out of their last bastions in Mogadishu in 2011 by a 22,000-strong African Union mission which has been in Somalia since 2007.  The following year they were routed from the port city of Kismayo but they retain control over vast rural areas and still launch attacks on military, political and civilian targets.  The deadly insurrection is the biggest security challenge for new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who is also having to contend with a devastating drought that has left millions hungry and fractious relations with several regions.  The International Crisis Group said in a June analysis that Al-Shabaab had been emboldened by the Taliban's takeover in Afghanistan and suggested that Mohamud should ""test the waters"" and try to engage with the jihadists.  ""Little suggests that Al-Shabaab will be defeated militarily but nor are militants likely to prevail in the long run.""  Al-Shabaab is estimated to have between 7,000 and 12,000 fighters as of this year, according to the CIA World Factbook.   In the deadliest attack in Somalia to date, a truck bombing in a busy neighbourhood of Mogadishu in October 2017 killed more than 500 people.      - Beyond its borders -    Al-Shabaab has carried out a spate of bloody attacks in neighbouring Kenya since its troops intervened in Somalia in 2011 as part of the AU force then known as AMISOM.   The deadliest was in April 2015 when 148 people, mainly students, were killed at Garissa University in northeastern Kenya.  In September 2013, Al-Shabaab claimed a bloody siege on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi that killed 67 people over four days.  The following year, in June-July, around 100 people were killed in raids in the Lamu region on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, home to the popular tourist island of the same name.  In January 2019, an hours-long attack on an upscale Nairobi hotel complex left at least 21 dead.  Its first major operation outside Somalia was in July 2010 in Uganda, the main contributor to the AU force. It carried out suicide bombings in two restaurants in the capital Kampala that killed 76 people.   In May 2014, it claimed an attack on a Djibouti restaurant packed with Westerners, saying it was targeting French ""crusaders"" and that the strike was in retaliation for Djibouti's hosting of the biggest US military base in Africa.  In the most recent action outside Somalia, Al-Shabaab fighters raided a military base on the border with Ethiopia in July, causing an unknown number of casualties.   It followed an incursion into Ethiopia, where local authorities in the Somali region said a three-day military operation had killed more than 100 Al-Shabaab members.      - Foreign forces -    The United Nations voted in March to replace AMISOM with ATMIS (the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia) which has a more offensive remit than its predecessor.  Its goal is to gradually reduce troop numbers to zero by the end of 2024 with security to be assumed by Somalia's army and police, although analysts doubt they will be ready by then.  The force is drawn from Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya, with troops deployed in southern and central Somalia.  In May, President Joe Biden ordered the reestablishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a move by his predecessor Donald Trump, who in late 2020 pulled out nearly all US forces.  Fewer than 500 troops will be involved, slightly smaller than the original number of about 750 who had spent years in the country.  Since Biden's announcement, US forces have carried out a number of deadly air strikes against Al-Shabaab operatives in Somalia.  burs/txw/ah",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Finding the boxes -- cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- could offer crucial clues as to why the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged some 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) in less than a minute before slamming into the Java Sea.   Investigators have so far offered little to explain why the plane crashed about four minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, but said Sunday they had pinpointed the location of the black boxes.   Some of the 2,600 personnel working in the recovery effort involving dozens of boats and helicopters are hauling body parts, twisted piece of wreckage and passengers' clothing from shallow waters about 23 metres (75 feet) deep.  Underwater photos supplied by Indonesia's navy showed a sea floor littered with wreckage.   Body bags filled with human remains were sprayed with disinfectant at Jakarta's main port before being taken to a police hospital where investigators hope to identify victims by matching DNA from their remains to living relatives.  All 62 passengers and crew aboard the half-full flight were Indonesian. The count included 10 children.  ""Today we're expanding the search area... and collecting anything we can retrieve, debris or the victims,"" Rasman MS, head of the search and rescue agency's crash operations, told reporters Monday.  ""It's going to be an around-the-clock operation -- 24 hours. There will be no breaks. The sooner we can find victims, the better.""    - Latest disaster -    The probe into the crash -- the latest in a string of disasters for Indonesia's aviation sector -- is likely to take months.  Aviation analysts said flight-tracking data showed the plane sharply deviated from its intended course before it went into a steep dive, with bad weather, pilot error and mechanical malfunction among the potential factors.  Stephen Wright, professor of aircraft systems at Finland's Tampere University, said the aircraft's relatively slow air speed was a red flag.  ""Something quite dramatic has happened after takeoff,"" he added.  Sriwijaya Air, which operates flights to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said little about the 26-year-old plane, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.   The Indonesian carrier has not recorded a fatal crash since it started operations in 2003.   But the Southeast Asian nation's fast-growing aviation sector has long been plagued by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.   That accident -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the accidents.

Iran's ""Khayyam"" satellite is scheduled to take off from the Moscow-operated Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 0552 GMT, three weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin met Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran.  Iran has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to improve its surveillance of military targets in Ukraine.  Last week, US daily The Washington Post quoted anonymous Western intelligence officials as saying that Russia ""plans to use the satellite for several months or longer"" to assist its war efforts before allowing Iran to take control.  But the Iranian Space Agency said on Sunday that the Islamic republic would control the Khayyam satellite ""from day one.""  ""No third country is able to access the information"" sent by the satellite due to its ""encrypted algorithm,"" it said.  The purpose of Khayyam is to ""monitor the country's borders"", enhance agricultural productivity and monitor water resources and natural disasters, the space agency said.  Khayyam is being taken into orbit by a Soyuz-2.1b rocket, Russia's space agency Roscosmos said last week.  As Moscow's international isolation grows under the weight of Western sanctions over Ukraine, Putin is seeking to pivot Russia towards the Middle East, Asia and Africa and find new clients for the country's embattled space programme.    - 'Long-term cooperation' -    Khayyam, apparently named after the 11th-century Persian polymath Omar Khayyam, will not be the first Iranian satellite that Russia has put into space -- in 2005, Iran's Sina-1 satellite was deployed from Russia's Plesetsk cosmodrome.  Iran is currently negotiating with world powers, including Moscow, to salvage a 2015 deal aimed at reining in Tehran's nuclear ambitions.  The United States -- which quit the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA under then-president Donald Trump in 2018 -- has accused Iran of effectively supporting Russia's war against Ukraine while adopting a ""veil of neutrality"".   During his meeting with Putin last month, Iran's Khamenei called for ""long-term cooperation"" with Russia, and Tehran has refused to join international condemnation of Moscow's invasion of its pro-Western neighbour.  Iran insists its space programme is for civilian and defence purposes only, and does not breach the 2015 nuclear deal, or any other international agreement.   Western governments worry that satellite launch systems incorporate technologies interchangeable with those used in ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, something Iran has always denied wanting to build.  Iran successfully put its first military satellite into orbit in April 2020, drawing a sharp rebuke from the United States.  cr-bur/spm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

Manila -- a longtime Washington ally -- agreed in November to pay 12.7 billion pesos ($228 million) for the Mi-17 helicopters, as it seeks to modernise its military hardware.  The United States and its allies imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Moscow in the wake of its assault on Ukraine in February.  They are aimed at cutting off Russia from the global financial system and choking off funds available to Moscow to finance the war.  The Philippine defence department was ""formalizing the termination"" of the contract, spokesman Arsenio Andolong said Wednesday.  Without mentioning US sanctions on Moscow, Andolong told AFP ""changes in priorities necessitated by global political developments resulted in the cancellation of the project by the previous administration"".  Delfin Lorenzana, who served as defence secretary under Duterte, said in March that the Philippines had paid a deposit for the transport helicopters before war erupted in Ukraine and the deal was ""on track"".  But last week Lorenzana, who now heads a different government agency, told local media that Duterte himself decided to cancel the deal in the waning days of his administration over the sanctions threat.  ""I don't know if we can still get back the money since we were the ones who terminated the contract,"" Lorenzana told reporters.  Russian embassy officials in Manila could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  Philippine ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez recently told AFP the decision to cancel was triggered by ""the Ukrainian war"".  Romualdez said Manila was also wary of falling foul of a US law passed in 2017 that sanctions anyone doing business with Russia's intelligence or defence sectors.  The United States was offering ""alternative helicopters to meet our needs"", he added.  Manila began a modest military modernisation programme in 2012.

Washington separately warned Moscow was preparing to hold ""sham"" referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine that would seek to formalise its control.  The Russian missile strike on Chaplino station, in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, killed 22 people he said. In an earlier toll he said 15 had died and 50 others had been wounded.  ""Chaplino is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, including five people who burned in a car. A youth died, he was 11 years old, a Russian rocket destroyed his house,"" he said in his daily address.  Zelensky was speaking on the day the nation celebrated its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union -- and on the day marking six months since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops to invade.  Over the weekend, he had warned that Russia might do something ""particularly cruel"" on Ukraine's independence day.  In Washington, a senior official warned that Russia could begin announcing referendums designed to formalise its control of occupied areas as soon as this week.  ""Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda,"" White House national security coordinator John Kirby said.  ""In fact, we can see a Russian announcement of the first one or ones before the end of this week.""  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid a surprise visit to Kyiv, hailing Ukraine's six-month long resistance, as sirens sounded throughout the day.  Putin had failed to account for the ""strong will of Ukrainians to resist"", Johnson said.  ""You defend your right to live in peace, in freedom, and that's why Ukraine will win,"" he added.  Earlier the Ukrainian leader had issued his own defiant morning video address, declaring: ""We don't care what army you have, we only care about our land. We will fight for it until the end.""  Referring to Russia he vowed Ukraine ""will not try to find an understanding with terrorists"".  ""For us Ukraine is the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. ""All 25 regions, without any concession or compromise.""    - Fresh aid -    The US, meanwhile, announced $3 billion in fresh military aid.  The new funding will help Kyiv acquire more materiel for its armed forces, locked in a grinding war of attrition with Russian troops in the east and south, with neither side advancing significantly.  Johnson unveiled his own £54 million ($64 million) package of aid, including 2,000 ""state-of-the-art drones"" as well as anti-tank munitions.  Gatherings were banned in the capital Kyiv and Zelensky had urged citizens to be on guard against ""Russian terror"".  Nevertheless he and his wife marked a minute of silence for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and laid yellow and blue floral bouquets at a memorial in central Kyiv.  Johnson's visit was accompanied by other messages of support from Ukraine's allies.  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the anniversary of the start of Russia's war in Ukraine a ""sad and tragic milestone"".  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU has been standing with Ukraine ""from the very beginning"" and ""will be for as long as it takes"".  Even Alexander Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader of Belarus congratulated Ukraine on its Independence Day, comments dismissed by a spokesman for the Ukrainian presidency.  Belarus offered its territory as a staging ground for Russia's invasion.    - Muted anniversary -    In the early days and weeks of Russia's invasion, Kyiv was under siege by Russian troops which reached the suburbs of the capital.  Moscow's offensive quickly faltered, and its forces withdrew in late March to regroup for assaults on Ukraine's east and south.  But in the capital, Ukrainians were sombre about the anniversary.   ""Six months, the peace of life has been broken in every family,"" Nina, an 80-year-old pensioner, said on Independence Square on Tuesday.  ""How much destruction, how many dead, how can we relate to it?"" she asked.  The capital city's administration shut public service centres on Wednesday and Thursday, and shopping centres said they would close for the anniversary over safety concerns.   However in central Kyiv trailing crowds of people inspected dozens of disabled Russian tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles installed near the government quarter to showcase Ukraine's military prowess.  Candy floss vendors sold to curious visitors who peered down tank barrels and posed for selfies, draped in the Ukrainian flag.   Discussions continued on how to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, occupied by Russian troops and threatened by shelling, which Moscow blames on Kyiv.  The two sides traded accusations at a Tuesday meeting of the UN Security Council on Zaporizhzhia.  Ukraine and its allies have demanded Russia pull its troops out of the plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- and agree to a demilitarised zone.

In the accord signed in Doha, the United States said it would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by May 2021 and the Taliban pledged not to allow extremists to operate from Afghanistan, although the group continued attacks on government forces.  The removal of Al-Qaeda was the original reason for the US invasion following the September 11, 2001 attacks.  But the agreement came with annexes that remain classified, leading to criticism in the United States that there were secret understandings with the Taliban.  On its way out, the Trump administration said Friday it had reduced troop levels to just 2,500, the lowest in decades.  Biden was an early advocate of ending the war in Afghanistan but his aides have more recently spoken of the need for a small force to counter outbreaks of violence -- a stance unlikely to be stomached by the Taliban.  Under questioning from Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a fellow Democrat, Blinken promised to consider the rights of women and girls whose freedoms were severely curtailed during the Taliban's 1996-2001 regime.

""We have received reports of many injuries in the Fukushima and Miyagi regions. But so far we have not received any reports of deaths,"" he told an emergency cabinet meeting on Sunday morning.

No abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the March 2011 quake that triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000 people.  Japan's meteorological agency said Saturday's quake, which hit at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific off Fukushima, was considered an aftershock of the massive tremor nearly a decade ago.  ""I was at home. I cannot even remember whether it was horizontal or vertical shaking. But it felt like it lasted for 30 seconds,"" Masami Nakai, a municipal official in Soma city in northern Fukushima, told AFP about Saturday's quake.  ""The shaking was so strong I became truly afraid of my physical safety,"" he said.  No significant damage was reported but authorities were assessing the impact of a landslide on a highway, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said, while aerial TV footage showed another landslide at a remote race circuit.  Kato warned residents about the possibility of strong aftershocks in the next week and further landslides due to heavy rain forecast.  ""Particularly for the next two to three days, there might be very strong earthquakes,"" Kato said.    - Emergency shelters -    Water outages were affecting 4,800 households, Kato said, adding that health ministry staff and self-defense troops were heading to affected areas to deliver water.  Around 950,000 homes lost power throughout the region, but electricity had been restored in most areas by Sunday morning, according to a regional utility.  Kato said as of early Sunday more than 250 people were at 173 emergency shelters in Fukushima and surrounding regions, where social distancing measures have been put in place. Many may have since returned home, he added.  Pfizer, whose coronavirus vaccine is set to become the first to be approved in Japan later Sunday, has told the government that the quake did not affect facilities storing the jabs, Kato said.  Images posted online showed broken glass at a shop and items spilled off the shelves at a supermarket.

Video footage posted by a rescue service showed desperate revellers fleeing the club screaming, their clothes ablaze, as a huge fire raged in the background.  The Sawang Rojanathammasathan Rescue Foundation said 14 people were killed and around 40 injured.  The service said the blaze was accelerated by flammable acoustic foam on the walls of the club, and it took firefighters more than three hours to bring it under control.

The dead -- four women and 10 men -- were found mostly crowded by the entrance and in the bathroom, their bodies severely burned, the service said.

The plan for a special international tribunal to investigate Russia's alleged ""crime of aggression"" is being spearheaded by Andrii Smirnov, deputy head of Ukraine's presidential administration.  The definition of the crime of aggression was adopted in the 2010 Rome Statute, and the similar notion of ""crime against peace"" was used in trials in Nuremberg and Tokyo after the Second World War.  The International Criminal Court, which has been trying the gravest crimes for the past 20 years, is already investigating war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine.  But it cannot look into accusations of aggression because neither Ukraine nor Russia have ratified the Rome Statute.  This court is ""the only way to make sure that the criminals who started the Ukraine war are held accountable quickly,"" Smirnov told AFP.  ""The world has a short memory. That's why I would like this tribunal to start working next year.""  Ukraine knows that the accused will not be present, but this tribunal ""will serve to make sure that these people are labelled as criminals, and that they cannot travel in the civilized world,"" he said.    - International treaty drafted -    Ukrainian prosecutors have identified some 600 suspects in the aggression so far, including senior military officials, politicians and commentators.  An international treaty to set up the tribunal has been drafted, ready to be signed by governments.  The court's decisions would then be recognised on the territory of the signatory countries, which means that any convicted offenders could be arrested there.  Smirnov said several countries are set to sign the document before the end of the year and negotiations are ongoing with ""several European partners (who) are willing to host the tribunal.""  ""We want this court's decisions to be recognised"" he said, arguing he ""perfectly understands"" that the court needs strong legitimacy.  Despite several reforms, Ukraine courts have been criticised for lack of independence and corruption in the past.  While Poland and the Baltic states -- Ukraine's closest partners -- have been very supportive of the proposals, Germany and France have given more measured reactions.  Political considerations may explain this.  ""Some countries, while acknowledging the aggression against Ukraine, are trying to keep a small window for negotiations with Vladimir Putin open,"" Smirnov said.  But, even in Western Europe, support is slowly building for the idea.  The European Parliament called for a special international tribunal for crimes of aggression on May 19.  And, speaking at an international conference on war crimes in Ukraine in The Hague last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the question of a special court was a ""very valid point"".  tbm/brw/dt/jj",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The country's 13.1 million voters will choose a successor to unpopular socialist President Lenin Moreno and the 137 members of the unicameral congress.  Opinion polls show leftist economist Andres Arauz and conservative Guillermo Lasso the clear frontrunners among 16 candidates, with indigenous rights campaigner Yaku Perez in a distant third place.  The vote takes place as Latin America is battling a second, deadly wave of Covid-19 which has aggravated Ecuador's economic troubles.  Strict health precautions appeared to slow voting, and may have discouraged some from casting their ballots as long lines stretched outside polling stations.  ""Instructions have been given by the authorities of the National Electoral Council for this situation to be relaxed to allow the lines to advance,"" election official Enrique Pita told local media.  Many voters arrived wearing face masks in a nation where the pandemic has claimed 15,000 lives and infected more than 257,000.  Front-runners Arauz and Lasso are both predicting victory for their side.  Arauz, 35, represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while businessman Lasso, 65, is from the CREO rightwing movement.  Arauz is a protege of two-time socialist president Rafael Correa, who remains a strong political force in the country despite a graft conviction that sank his hopes of campaigning to become Arauz's deputy.  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year, austerity-driven hiatus under Moreno.  Arauz has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.  Running in his third presidential race, free market advocate Lasso has said he would create a million jobs in a year.  He will likely stick to the austerity policies adopted by Moreno, who has had to rein in spending in exchange for International Monetary Fund loans to bolster the oil-producing country's faltering dollar-based economy.    - Second round? -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno as the price of crude crashed.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, is not seeking reelection.  Given the polling numbers, it is unlikely the first presidential round will be decisive.   To emerge victorious, a candidate must take half of the votes cast, plus one, or at least 40 percent with a 10 percentage point advantage over his nearest rival.  A second round is provisionally scheduled for April 11.  Perez, the first indigenous contender in 15 years, is polling at 12 percent. The remaining 12 candidates are all at under four percent, including the only woman on the list -- Ximena Pena.  bur-mlr/mtp/bgs/wat","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76763779', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84078919']"

In a statement, the US Navy said the transit ""demonstrates the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""  Tensions in the Taiwan Strait soared to their highest level in years this month after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.   Beijing reacted furiously, staging days of air and sea exercises around Taiwan. Taipei condemned the drills and missile tests as preparation for an invasion.  Taiwan lives under constant threat of an invasion by China, which claims the self-ruled, democratic island as part of its territory to be seized one day -- by force if necessary.  Washington diplomatically recognizes Beijing over Taipei, but maintains de facto relations with Taiwan and supports the island's right to decide its own future.  The US 7th Fleet said the pair of Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers -- the USS Antietam and the USS Chancellorsville -- conducted the ""routine"" transit on Sunday ""through waters where high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law.""  ""These ships transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State,"" a statement said.   ""The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows.""  The 7th fleet is based in Japan and is a core part of Washington's navy presence in the Pacific.  The US and Western allies have increased ""freedom of navigation"" crossings by naval vessels of both the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea to reinforce the concept that those seas are international waterways, sparking anger from Beijing.  Washington has said its position on Taiwan remains unchanged and has accused China of threatening peace in the Taiwan Strait, using the visit by Pelosi as a pretext for military exercises.  China's drills included firing multiple ballistic missiles into waters off Taiwan -- some of the world's busiest shipping routes -- which was the first time Beijing has taken such a step since the mid-1990s.  Taiwan staged its own drills, simulating a defense against invasion, displaying its most advanced fighter jet in a rare nighttime demonstration.

The second demonstration in three days against Erdogan's pick for Bogazici University delivered a rare challenge to the Turkish leader since he cracked down on dissent after surviving a coup bid in 2016.  More than 1,000 people scuffled with police on Monday to protest Erdogan's appointment of Melih Bulu -- a losing candidate from the ruling AKP party in the 2015 general election -- as rector of the prestigious public institution.  Turkish police responded by arresting 36 people in a series of raids that began in the early hours of Tuesday.  They then fenced off the university and handcuffed its gates to avert a planned rally by students and their supporters on Wednesday.  Organisers regrouped and decided to hold a protest march instead that they coordinated through social media.  Hundreds walked chanting and holding up slogans along the Bosphorus before boarding a ferry and crossing to the Asian side of Istanbul for a rally attended by a crowd that AFP reporters estimated at more than 1,000.  Anti-riot police watched without intervening along the route.  ""To walk together on such a day of defiance makes us feel very good,"" said student Zehra Aydemir.  ""I am proud that my friends and I were able to meet up and fight for what we want,"" added university graduate Cinar Cifter.    - 'Nothing else matters' -    The march attracted a mixed but overwhelmingly young crowd that held up political posters and waved rainbow flags in support of LGBTQ rights.  Some danced around to the sounds of Metallica -- an ironic refence to a TV interview Bulu gave Tuesday in which he claimed to listen to the US heavy metal group.  One placard referred to Erdogan as ""Master of Puppets"" -- the name of a 1986 Metallica album and song -- while another cited the band's iconic refrain: ""nothing else matters"".  Erdogan has not referred to the protests in public.  But Turkish officials are keen to avoid a repeat of 2013 Gezi Park protests that began as a defence of a small green space in the heart of Istanbul before morphing into the first serious challenges to Erdogan's rule.  Erdogan's ruling coalition partner Devlet Bahceli of the ultranationalist MHP party said the protests ""need to be crushed"" before they grow any further.  ""Those who are trying to strangle Turkey by taking this rector's nomination as an excuse are terrorists' pawns and separatists dressed as students,"" Bahceli said Wednesday.  The protesters were ""trying to create a new Gezi uprising,"" Bahceli said.  Rectors for Turkey's universities were appointed through elections from the 1990s to July 2016.  Bogazici University has traditionally been a stronghold of leftist causes that made into a government's target on past occasions.

Washington is growing increasingly alarmed that the Russian government and businesses are using Turkey to evade Western financial and trading restrictions imposed in response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine six months ago.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to step up economic cooperation at a summit in the Black Sea resort of Sochi earlier this month.  Official data show the value of Turkish exports to Russia between May and July growing by nearly 50 percent from last year's figure.  Turkey's imports of Russian oil are ballooning and the two sides have agreed to transition to ruble payments for the natural gas exported by the Kremlin-tied giant Gazprom.  US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo paid a rare visit to Ankara and Istanbul in June to express Washington's worries that Russian oligarchs and big businesses were using Turkish entities to avoid Western sanctions.  NATO member Turkey -- on good terms with both Moscow and Kyiv -- has tried to stay neutral in the conflict and refused to join the international sanctions regime.  Adeyemo followed that up with a letter to Turkey's TUSIAD business association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Turkey warning that companies and banks were in danger of being sanctioned themselves.  TUSIAD said in a statement on Tuesday that is has passed on the letter to Turkey's foreign and finance ministries.  The letter's contents were first reported by The Wall Street Journal this week.    - 'Risk of US sanctions' -    ""Any individuals or entities providing material support to US-designated persons are themselves at risk of US sanctions,"" Adeyemo wrote.  ""Turkish banks cannot expect to establish corresponding relationships with sanctioned Russian banks and retain their corresponding relationships with major global banks as well as access to the US dollar and other major currencies.""  The economic cooperation agreement sealed by Erdogan and Putin includes a deal for more Turkish banks to start processing Russia's Mir payments system.  Turkish officials have not formally responded to Adeyemo's letter.  Broader cooperation with Russia could help support Turkey's ailing economy in the runup to next-year's general election.  Erdogan has previously argued that Ankara cannot join Western sanctions on Moscow because of Turkey's heavy dependence on Russian oil and natural gas imports.

Ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting in Phnom Penh warned against ""provocative action"".  The situation ""could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers,"" the ministers said in a joint statement published Thursday.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is attending the summit along with his US counterpart Anthony Blinken, though they are not expected to hold a one-on-one meeting.  Beijing, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory to one day be reclaimed, by force if necessary, was enraged by the trip by Pelosi -- the highest-profile elected US official to visit the island in 25 years.  It vowed ""punishment"" and state TV said it began military drills, including live-fire exercises, at 0400 GMT in several areas encircling Taiwan.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, in Phnom Penh for talks with ASEAN, condemned the Chinese response.  ""There is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait.

Kung Phoak, Cambodia's deputy foreign minister and ASEAN spokesman, urged both sides to stabilise the situation.

But no ASEAN country formally recognises Taiwan and none have shown an appetite for backing Taipei against the communist giant.  The ministers' statement -- which avoided referring to Taiwan by name -- said ASEAN ""stands ready to play a constructive role in facilitating peaceful dialogue"", though it is not clear either side is interested in outside mediation.  While Wang and Blinken are not scheduled to meet bilaterally, they will both attend a meeting Friday of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a 27-member body set up to discuss security issues that also includes Russia and the EU.

""This is a major shot across the bow from Microsoft to Tesla and Waymo and other EV (electric vehicle) autonomous players that Redmond is on its way,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.  ""There is an arms race in the EV world and this is the latest collaborative deal with many more on there way, speaking to this trillion dollar market over the next decade.""  Ives and others think Apple is poised to begin putting its technology to work in self-driving, electric cars although the iPhone maker has remained mum on the subject.  Microsoft Azure is a powerhouse in the cloud computing market, so synching GM electric vehicles with Azure computing and artificial intelligence capabilities promises a boon for the car maker, Ives reasoned.  Microsoft also will provide hardware and software engineering support to GM as part of the alliance, which values Cruise at some $30 billion.  ""Our mission to bring safer, better, and more affordable transportation to everyone isn't just a tech race -- it's also a trust race,"" Cruise chief executive Dan Ammann said.  ""Microsoft, as the gold standard in the trustworthy democratization of technology, will be a force multiplier for us as we commercialize our fleet of self-driving, all-electric, shared vehicles.""  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the venture will help GM and Cruise to ""scale and make autonomous transportation mainstream.""  Last week, GM announced plans to build a fleet of new electric vans.    - Windscreen-free future? -    The partnership comes on the heels of a series of GM announcements to reposition the Detroit giant to compete with Tesla and other newer players.

Perhaps seats will face each other as in train cars, or there will be no need for front windows or driver seats.  Electric vehicle maker Rivian separately said it raised $2.65 billion in a new funding round valuing the Amazon-backed US company at $26.7 billion.  Investors included Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund and Fidelity Management and Research, according to Rivian.  Amazon is set to launch its own electric delivery vans ordered from the startup.  Waymo, the autonomous car unit of Google-parent Alphabet, late last year opened its robo-taxi project to the general public in the US city of Phoenix, becoming the first widely available driverless ride service.  Early last year, Waymo raised $2.25 billion in its first external funding round to accelerate its deployment of autonomous cars and trucks.    - Retrofitted future? -    Global Equities analyst Trip Chowdhry was skeptical of traditional car makers such as GM being able to recreate the mix of technology, manufacturing, logistics, and culture that has been a winning formula for electric car star Tesla.  ""You cannot retrofit into the new world,"" Chowdhry said while discussing the GM alliance with Microsoft.

Flight tracking data showed the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport.  Sixty-two passengers and crew were on board, including 10 children, the nation's transport minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, told reporters.  The suspected crash site is near tourist islands just off the coast of Indonesia's sprawling capital.  Sriwijaya Air flight SJ182 was bound for Pontianak on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  Distraught relatives waited nervously for news at the city's airport.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" Yaman Zai said as he sobbed.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby today...How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  The plane took off on Saturday afternoon and a search and rescue operation began with no official results available on Saturday night.  ""We deployed our team, boats and sea riders to the location suspected to be where it went down after losing contact,"" Bambang Suryo Aji, a senior official at the search-and-rescue agency, told reporters after nightfall.    - Sudden plunge -    Data from FlightRadar24 said the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  ""Sriwijaya Air flight #SJ182 lost more than 10,000 feet of altitude in less than one minute, about 4 minutes after departure from Jakarta,"" the tracking agency said on its official Twitter account.  Broadcaster Kompas TV quoted local fishermen as saying they had found debris near islands just off the coast of the capital Jakarta, but it could not be immediately confirmed as having belonged to the missing jet.  Authorities and the airline gave no immediate indication as to why the plane suddenly went down.  But transport minister Sumadi said the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  Among the other passengers was Agus Minari and her husband who were on their way back to Pontianak after visiting her son and attending a funeral in Java, according to her cousin Deni Triady.  ""The family is deeply shocked,"" Triady added.  Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement offering his ""sincere condolences"" over the incident.  The budget airline, which has about 19 Boeing jets that fly to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and a subsequent fatal flight in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  The Boeing jet thought to have crashed Saturday is not a MAX model and was 26 years old, according to authorities.   ""We are aware of media reports from Jakarta, and are closely monitoring the situation,"" the US-based planemaker said in a statement.  ""We are working to gather more information.""  Indonesia's aviation sector has long suffered from a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane crashed with the loss of 162 lives.   Domestic investigators' final report on the AirAsia crash showed a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance and the pilots' inadequate response were major factors in what was supposed to be a routine flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.  A year later, in 2015, more than 140 people, including people on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/jfx/dw     BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

It has become a key player on the regional stage, but its economy has been hard hit by the Covid pandemic, a punishing drought and the fallout from the war in Ukraine.  As it heads to the polls on Tuesday, here are key facts about the country:    - End of Kenyatta era -    Kenya became independent from Britain on December 12, 1963, scarred by the 1952-1960 Mau Mau rebellion against colonial rule that left at least 10,000 people dead.  Independence struggle icon Jomo Kenyatta was appointed Kenya's first post-colonial leader. He died in office in August 1978, succeeded by his vice president Daniel arap Moi.  In late 1991 Moi abandoned single-party rule and won presidential elections in 1992 and 1997.  Mwai Kibaki then swept into power in 2002 and went on to win re-election in 2007 against Raila Odinga, now one of the frontrunners on August 9.  Disputes over the 2007 vote count sparked the most serious political violence since independence, with more than 1,100 people killed in ethnic clashes.  Jomo Kenyatta's son Uhuru Kenyatta defeated Odinga in the 2013 elections despite being charged by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the violence.  The court dropped its case against him in 2014 and Kenyatta was re-elected in 2017, after the Supreme Court annulled his initial victory and Odinga boycotted the rerun.  Deputy President William Ruto, Odinga's main rival next week, was also charged by the ICC but prosecutors abandoned the case in 2016.    - 'Cradle of Mankind' -     Kenya attracted about 1.5 million visitors last year to its wildlife parks and idyllic Indian Ocean beaches.  From the Maasai Mara to Amboseli, Kenya boasts about 50 parks and reserves that are home to native wildlife including the so-called Big Five -- lions, elephants, rhinos, leopards and buffalo -- as well as giraffes, hippos and cheetahs.  The Rift Valley that stretches from Tanzania to Ethiopia via Kenya is also the site of major discoveries of fossils showing man's evolution and has been dubbed the ""Cradle of Mankind"".  The remains of hominids believed to be nearly six million years old have been found in Kenya.    - East African hub -    Kenya has a mostly Christian population of about 50 million, according to government figures, made up of more than 40 tribes, the largest being Kikuyu.  Along with Ethiopia, it is East Africa's biggest economy with gross domestic product of just over $110 billion in 2021, according to the World Bank, and remains the region's main trading hub.  Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, accounting for more than a fifth of GDP, with key exports including tea, coffee and flowers.  Kenya estimates its economy grew by 7.5 percent last year after shrinking 0.3 percent in 2020 as the pandemic threw hundreds of thousands of people out of work.  It is now grappling with a cost of living crisis, as prices of fuel and basic foodstuffs soar in a country where about a third of the population lives in poverty.  Kenya also suffers from endemic corruption. It was ranked 128th out of 180 countries on Transparency International's 2021 corruption perceptions index, with the watchdog saying its fight against graft had ""stagnated"".    - Athletics stars -    Kenya is renowned for its athletes, especially long-distance runners, with a raft of world championship medals and records.  Among its numerous stars are marathon world record holders Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei and Africa's fastest man over 100 metres, Ferdinand Omanyala.  Kenyan athletics is nevertheless struggling to rebuild a reputation tarnished by doping and corruption.    - Bloody attacks -    Kenya has suffered a string of terror attacks, the deadliest on August 7, 1998 when massive truck bombings against the US embassy in Nairobi killed 213 people and wounded 5,000. It was claimed by Al-Qaeda.  Kenya has also been targeted by the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab since 2011 when the Kenyan military entered Somalia to fight the jihadists.  In September 2013, Islamist gunmen stormed Nairobi's Westgate mall, killing at least 67 people. In April 2015 another Al-Shabaab attack killed 148 at a university in Garissa, eastern Kenya.  txw/amu/ri",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']

At least 13 civilians have been killed and dozens wounded since militants from the Al-Qaeda affiliate unleashed a gun and bomb attack on the popular Hayat Hotel on Friday evening, according to Somali officials.   ""The security forces have ended the siege now and the gunmen are dead, we've had no incoming gunfire from the building in the past hour,"" the commander told AFP on condition of anonymity.  He gave no further information about the total number of civilian or security casualties or how many Al-Shabaab fighters had been killed, saying the government would give a press briefing on Sunday morning.  The building still needed to be cleared of any explosives that may have been planted, he added.  This was the biggest attack in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June and underscores the huge challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist militant group.  The hotel, a popular spot for government officials, has been destroyed after security forces pounded it with heavy weapons late Saturday in a bid to eliminate the assailants who were holed up there for a second straight night.  Witnesses watching the drama unfold from the rooftop of another building said they saw flames tear through the hotel during the bombardment by security forces, with heavy explosions and gunfire reported.  Scores of people were trapped when the assault began and although officials said dozens had been rescued, including children, it is not known how were still inside when the siege ended.  Al-Shabaab, which has carried out numerous deadly attacks in its war against the fragile government in the Horn of Africa nation, has claimed responsibility.   Security official Mohamed Abdikadir had told AFP earlier the number of civilians confirmed to have died was 13, while police officer Ibrahim Duale put the toll at more than 10.  The director of Mogadishu's main trauma hospital, Mohamed Abdirahman Jama, said it was treating at least 40 people wounded in the hotel attack and a separate mortar strike on a seaside area, Hamar Jajab.  ""Among those critically wounded are a newlywed bride and her groom and a family of three children, a mother and their father,"" Hamar Jajab district commissioner Mucawiye Muddey told AFP.    - Children found hiding in toilet -     One woman, Hayat Ali, said three young relatives aged between four and seven were found by security forces hiding in a hotel toilet in a state of shock but were later reunited with their family.  Another survivor told AFP he and some colleagues had performed evening prayers before taking tea in one of the hotel's open spaces when they heard the first explosions Friday, the start of the weekend in the mainly Muslim country.  ""I managed to run to a nearby exit gate away from the gunmen,"" Hussein Ali said. ""The gunmen started firing and I could hear the shots behind me, but thanks to God... we managed to escape.""  Somalia's allies including the United States, Britain and Turkey as well as the UN have strongly condemned the attack, as has ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  Witnesses had reported at least two powerful explosions on Friday as gunmen burst into the hotel. Police said the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with other gunmen.  A second explosion occurred just minutes later, witnesses said, inflicting more casualties as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to the scene.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces were still in control of the building and that they had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  In a statement by the group's news agency cited by the SITE Intelligence monitoring group, the jihadists claimed to have held hostages during the siege including government and security officials.      Al-Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopia border.  Earlier this week, the United States announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - Decades of chaos -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Al-Shabaab was driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 by AU forces, but still controls swathes of countryside and is able to launch deadly strikes on political, civilian and military targets, with hotels and restaurants often hit.  Earlier this month, Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre appointed the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow defected from Al-Shabaab in 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5 million bounty for his capture.  Somalia has been mired in chaos since the fall of president Siad Barre's military regime in 1991, with civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  nur-txw/jj",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

The revellers had set up the illegal rave in Lieuron, south of Rennes in Brittany, after skirmishes with police, said a statement from the local prefecture. Many were still on the site Friday as a sanitary cordon was thrown up around it.  Local gendarmes tried to ""prevent this event but faced fierce hostility from many partygoers"" who set one of their cars of fire and threw bottles and stones, the statement said.  Those present had come from across France and even abroad, it said.   By Friday evening, the sound of techno music could still be heard from the party venue, though police were preventing any newcomers from joining the rave, according to an AFP photographer.  ""Police controls are taking place around the site. Verbal warnings are being given to everyone leaving,"" the police said on social media.  Speaking later on BFM TV, interior ministry spokeswoman Camille Chaize said there had been ""great hostility, great violence"" against the forces of law and order, without indicating when the police would be able enter the rave site.  Such mass gatherings are strictly prohibited across France to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and a nationwide 8:00 pm curfew -- which was not lifted for New Year -- applies across the country.   Reports said that the rave party took place in an empty warehouse belonging to a storage company.  Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the illegal organisation of a musical gathering and premeditated violence against persons in authority.   Vehicles registered from all over France were still parked at the site Friday.    - 'Little social distancing' -    Participants interviewed by AFP said that the revellers had included partygoers from foreign countries, including Spain and Britain.  One participant, who gave his name as Jo from the Alsace region of eastern France and refused to be identified further, said they had all met at a designated spot Thursday evening in the parking lot of a shopping centre.   Then, the convoy headed for Lieuron, where the police tried to prevent them from passing, he said.  He acknowledged that ""very few had respected social distancing"" at the event, which was supposed only to end later on Saturday.

""The United States intends to seek a five-year extension of New START, as the treaty permits,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.

She said that the new intelligence chief, Avril Haines, would also start an investigation into Russia's suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, its alleged election interference and on whether Moscow was behind the massive SolarWinds hack.  She said the United States would also investigate bounties reportedly paid by Russian intelligence to extremists in Afghanistan who killed US troops.  ""Even as we work with Russia to advance US Interests, so, too, we work to hold Russia to account for its reckless and adversarial actions,"" Psaki said.

The blaze started for unknown reasons at the Abu Sifine church in the capital's northwestern, working-class district of Imbaba.   President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi declared on his Facebook page: ""I have mobilised all state services to ensure that all measures are taken.""  Fire services later said the blaze had been brought under control.  The Egyptian Coptic Church reported ""41 dead and 14 injured"" citing ""sources in the Ministry of Health"", in a statement posted on its Facebook page.  The prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation and sent a team to the scene to establish the cause of the blaze.  Copts are the largest Christian community in the Middle East, making up at least 10 million of Egypt's 103 million people.  The minority has suffered attacks and complained of discrimination in the majority Muslim north African country, the Arab world's most populous.  Copts have suffered deadly attacks at the hands of Islamists, particularly after Sisi overthrew former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, with churches, schools and homes burnt down.   Copts feel they have been left out of key state positions and deplored restrictive legislation for the construction of churches compared to that of mosques.   Sisi, the first Egyptian president to attend the Coptic Christmas mass every year, recently appointed a Coptic judge to head the Constitutional Court for the first time in history.  Sisi said Sunday he had ""presented his condolences by phone"" to Coptic Pope Tawadros II, who has been the head of Egypt's Christian community since 2012.  Accidental fires are not uncommon in the sprawling megalopolis of Cairo, where millions of Egyptians live in informal settlements.   Egypt, with its often dilapidated and poorly maintained infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.  In March 2021, at least 20 people died in a blaze in a textile factory in an eastern suburb of Cairo.

The crew is made up of five Iranians and 14 Venezuelans. On July 19, a US court in the District of Columbia issued an order to seize the plane on the grounds that US ""export control laws"" were violated.   The court alleged an ""unauthorized transfer"" from Mahan Air -- an airline affiliated with the Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF), which Washington considers a terrorist organization and has sanctioned -- to Emtrasur, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan company Conviasa, which is also under sanctions from the US Treasury.

Local gendarmes tried ""prevent this event but faced fierce hostility from many partygoers"" who set one of their cars of fire and threw bottles and stones, it said.  Those present had come from across France and even abroad, it said.   Such mass gatherings are strictly prohibited across France to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and a nationwide 8:00 pm curfew -- which was not lifted for New Year -- applies across the country.   Reports said that the rave party took place in a empty warehouse belonging to a storage company.

The vote in the wealthy northeastern region could see a high level of abstentions as Spain battles a third wave of coronavirus infections.  While some 5.5 million people are eligible to vote, polls suggested a lower turnout than the roughly 80 percent who voted at the last regional election in December 2017.  To decrease the risk of contagion, regional authorities set up polling station in spacious venues such as around FC Barcelona's football stadium and the bullring in the port city of Tarragona.  ""It's obvious that it's not the best moment to hold an election,"" Sergi Lopes, 40, told AFP at a polling station in Barcelona.  ""But when you take the metro to go to work every day, you are also being exposed.""  The regional government tried to postpone the elections until the end of May because of the pandemic but the courts blocked that move.    - Three-way race -    Voting started at 9:00 am (0800 GMT) and is due to close at 8:00 pm (1900 GMT), with the final hour of voting reserved for people infected with Covid-19 or undergoing quarantine.   During this time polling staff will wear gloves, facial screens and protective gowns.  Turnout stood at 22.8 percent at 1:00 pm, according to the Catalan regional government, compared to 34.7 percent recording at the same time during the previous election in December 2017.  But Bernat Sole, Catalonia's government official in charge of the election, said he expected participation to pick up in the afternoon, as the first three hours were reserved for voting by people more at risk of catching the virus.  Results are expected around midnight.  While more than 40 percent of the 82,000 people assigned to help staff polling stations on the day had asked to be recused, all polling stations were operating normally as of noon, said the Catalan government.  Voters entered one by one to avoid crowding, forcing people to stand in lines outside under intermittent rain.  ""It's raining, there are queues, we are getting wet... it's not well organised,"" said Josep Maria Prats, a 59-year-old health worker as he waited to vote in Barcelona.  Polls had suggested the Socialists -- who govern at the national level -- were neck-and-neck with the two pro-independence parties that have governed Catalonia together for the past five years.  Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is hoping this election, the fifth in a decade, will end their rule.  He took part in several rallies to support the Socialists' top candidate, former health minister Salvador Illa who gained a high-profile for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.    - Separatist battle -    Even if Illa's Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) was to come out on top, polls suggest separatist parties together could once again manage a ruling majority, despite deep divisions since the failed 2017 independence bid.  If that happened, it would be a repeat of the last election in December 2017 when the stridently pro-unity Ciudadanos won the most seats but was unable to form a government.  The main question then is which of Catalonia's two main separatist parties will come out stronger -- the hardline JxC -- ""Together for Catalonia"" -- or the more moderate ERC.  In the previous election in December 2017, JxC was ahead, forming a 70-seat coalition with ERC.  Should the tables be turned in ERC's favour, it would likely ease tensions and help the tentative reconciliation Sanchez's government has sought to broker since coming to power.   Sanchez came to lead Spain's government in 2018 thanks in part to support from Catalan separatists and his minority government relies on them to pass legislation.  ""An ERC executive would maintain the current ambiguous approach of criticising Madrid rhetorically but not adopting any unilateral measures,"" said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at political consultancy Teneo.  ""In contrast, a government headed by JxC would probably lead to a more confrontational stance.""  dbh/ds/jj",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48838589']

The vote took place amid a backdrop of economic problems exacerbated by a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed 15,000 lives in Ecuador, and Sunday's polls were marred by long lines of people waiting to cast ballots as virus restrictions caused chaos.  With 32.3 percent of the vote, Arauz, a protege of former president Rafael Correa, claimed a ""resounding victory in all regions of our beautiful country"", although he urged supporters to wait for official results before celebrating.  The battle for second place between indigenous candidate Yaku Perez and right-wing ex-banker Guillermo Lasso has been full of twists.

Arauz's mentor Correa -- a two-time president who currently lives in Belgium to evade a conviction for corruption -- remains a strong force in the country.  ""People have voted not in direct support to Arauz but because he is the Correa candidate,"" political scientist Karen Garzon Sherdek, from the International University SEK, told AFP.  ""Thank you dear Ecuador!"" Correa tweeted as the results came in. ""The Citizen Revolution has won overwhelmingly, despite a dirty campaign and 4 years of brutal persecution and infamy.""  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year, austerity-driven hiatus under Moreno.  He has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.    - Under pressure -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno as the price of crude crashed.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.

The unprecedented sanctions came after the president took to social media to repeat his numerous false claims about fraud and other impropriety in the election he lost to Joe Biden.  ""This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video,"" said Facebook vice president of integrity Guy Rosen.  ""We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.""  Facebook barred Trump from posting at the social network or its Instagram service for 24 hours, saying his messages were promoting violence.  Trump's falsehoods, ranging from specific allegations to broad conspiracy theories, also prompted Facebook to change a label added to posts aiming to undermine the election results.  The new label reads: ""Joe Biden has been elected president with results that were certified by all 50 states. The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power after an election.""  An activist group calling itself a mock Facebook oversight board said sanctions against Trump at the social network were long overdue.  ""This is too little, too late,"" the group said in a statement.  ""Donald Trump has breached Facebook's own terms and conditions multiple times. His account is not just a threat to democracy but to human life.""    - Permanent Twitter ban? -    The crackdown came after Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attack that led to one woman being shot and killed by police, interrupting congressional debate over Biden's election victory.  The assault came after the president had urged supporters to march on the seat of government during a speech outside the White House in which he alleged baselessly that the election had been stolen from him.  He later released a video on social media in which he repeated the false claim -- even telling the mob ""I love you.""  YouTube removed the video in line with its policy barring claims challenging election results.  Twitter said Trump's messages were violations of the platform's rules on civic integrity and that any future violations ""will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.""  The messaging platform said Trump's account would be locked for 12 hours and that if the offending tweets were not removed, ""the account will remain locked.""  Facebook said it would search for and remove content which praised the storming of the Capitol or encouraged the violence.  The platform said it would seek to take down additional calls for protests, including peaceful ones, if they violated a curfew imposed by the city of Washington, or any attempts to ""re-stage"" the storming of Congress.  ""The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,"" a Facebook spokesperson said.  ""We prohibit incitement and calls for violence on our platform. We are actively reviewing and removing any content that breaks these rules.""  Facebook maintained that it was in contact with law enforcement officials and continued to enforce bans on QAnon conspiracy group, militarized social movements, and hate groups.

Steven Sund, who heads the agency tasked with protecting the US Congress, said officers had been expecting a rally for demonstrators wishing to exercise their freedom of speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment.  ""But make no mistake -- these mass riots were not First Amendment activities; they were criminal riotous behavior,"" Sund said in a statement.  The Capitol Police's handling of Wednesday's mass break-in has drawn intense scrutiny, with observers wondering why there seemed to be only a small number of officers protecting the famous building.   They were quickly overwhelmed by protesters and waited until it was too late to request backup from the Washington metropolitan police force, which normally does not have authority to work on federal properties like the Capitol.  The Capitol force was ""conducting a thorough review of this incident, security planning and policies and procedures,"" Sund said.   Washington Police Chief Robert Contee said his agency only got a call for help at 1:00 pm Wednesday, well after protesters had begin forcing their way through barriers.  ""Things were already pretty bad at that point,"" Contee said Thursday.  ""This was plainly a failure,"" said Brian Schatz, a Senator from Hawaii.  ""US Capitol security needs a total overhaul,"" he tweeted.   ""The physical breaching and desecration of our temple of democracy must never happen again.""  A Capitol police officer fatally shot one woman as she tried to enter a corridor in the building.   That officer had been placed on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated, Sund said.  He pointed to a chaotic day with multiple incidents unfolding simultaneously including the discovery of two pipe bombs.   ""The violent attack on the US Capitol was unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington, DC,"" Sund said.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104705419', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104717056']"

Outgoing President Donald Trump entered the White House four years ago as a brash billionaire outsider, but he is being ousted by a polar opposite whose deep knowledge of Washington and personal scars will unquestionably set a different tone.  Biden, a 78-year-old former vice president and longtime senator, will take the oath of office at noon (1700 GMT) on the US Capitol's western front, the very spot where pro-Trump rioters clashed with police two weeks ago before storming Congress in a deadly insurrection.  While a transition of power will occur much as it has for more than two centuries, this inauguration is unlike any other.  Official Washington has taken on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat of this month's attack.  And with the pandemic raging, the general public is essentially barred from attending the swearing-in, leading to the unprecedented sight of an empty National Mall on Inauguration Day.  With the death toll soaring past 400,000, Biden on Tuesday led a powerful tribute to victims of Covid-19 as he arrived in Washington.  Biden, who has suffered deep personal tragedy and is known for his public displays of emotion, has stressed the need to unite the country after Trump's chaos.  ""It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" Biden said in somber remarks at the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial.    - Trump snub -    Inauguration eve is normally a time of massive crowds gathering in the capital, but Biden, joined by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, was almost alone at the reflecting pool.  On the Mall's grassy expanse, some 200,000 flags have been planted to represent the absent crowds at the inauguration.  Trump, who has not appeared in public for a week, broke days of silence with a pre-recorded farewell video address on Tuesday.  For the first time, he asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming administration -- a change from months spent persuading his Republican followers that the Democrats cheated their way to election victory.  Trump, whose efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and console its victims have been widely criticized, will snub Biden by not attending the inauguration.  He has also yet to personally congratulate Biden, who first ran for president in 1987, on his win, and did not invite him for the customary cup of tea in the Oval Office.  In one of his last acts before he flies to Florida on Wednesday morning, Trump issued scores of pardons to people convicted of crimes or facing charges, including several key allies.  Influential former Trump aide Steve Bannon -- charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall, a flagship Trump policy -- was among 73 people on a list released by the White House.  However, neither Trump nor his relatives were listed, amid speculation he could use the legally dubious tactic of a preemptive pardon to fend off future charges.  Former Trump fund-raiser Elliott Broidy was similarly pardoned, after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws.  The rapper Lil Wayne, who last month pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, and faced 10 years in jail, also made the list.  Tensions have soared on Capitol Hill, where the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.  The spectacle will clash with the opening days of Biden's tenure, as the new president seeks to swiftly confirm his Cabinet picks and push through ambitious legislation -- including a $1.9 trillion rescue package.    - 'I'll get right to work' -    ""We don't have a second to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face as a nation,"" Biden tweeted late Tuesday.  ""That's why after being sworn in tomorrow, I'll get right to work.""  He plans to kick off his tenure by rejoining the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, according to aides, who said Biden would sign 17 orders and actions just hours after being sworn in, setting new paths on immigration, the environment, Covid-19 and the economy.  In first-day moves, he will end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.  His inaugural speech will last between 20 and 30 minutes, according to a source familiar with preparations, and ""he will reach out to all Americans, and call on every citizen to be part of meeting the extraordinary challenges facing all of us.""  To symbolize the new spirit of unity, Biden has invited the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell -- and other congressional leaders to attend a church service with him Wednesday before the inauguration.  sms-mlm/bgs/leg/oho",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Just hours after Friday's attack at a literary event in western New York state, the British author had undergone emergency surgery for potentially life-threatening injuries.  But his condition, while still serious, has since shown clear signs of improvement and he no longer requires assisted breathing.  ""He's off the ventilator, so the road to recovery has begun,"" his agent Andrew Wylie said in a statement. ""It will be long; the injuries are severe, but his condition is headed in the right direction.""  The prize-winning writer -- who spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders called for Rushdie's killing over his portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed in his novel ""The Satanic Verses"" -- was about to be interviewed as part of a lecture series when a man rushed the stage and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and abdomen.  The suspected assailant, 24-year-old Hadi Matar from New Jersey, was wrestled to the ground by staff and other audience members before being taken into police custody.  He was later arraigned in court and pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges. He is scheduled to appear again on August 19.  Rushdie's son said the family was ""extremely relieved"" that his father was breathing unaided and had been able to ""say a few words.""  ""Though his life-changing injuries are severe, his usual feisty and defiant sense of humor remains intact,"" Zafar Rushdie said in a statement.  The event host, who was on stage with Rushdie and was also injured in the attack, said he initially thought it was a practical joke -- until he realized his famous guest was bleeding.  ""It was very difficult to understand. It looked like a sort of bad prank and it didn't have any sense of reality. And then, when there was blood behind him, it became real,"" Henry Reese, his face heavily bandaged, told CNN in an interview.    - Questions surround suspect -    Police and prosecutors have provided scant information about Matar's background or the possible motivation behind the attack.  Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.  The 75-year-old Rushdie had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989.  That was when Iran's then-supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer for what he deemed the blasphemous nature of ""The Satanic Verses.""  Rushdie, who was born in India in 1947, moved to New York two decades ago and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public - often without noticeable security.  In an interview given to Germany's Stern magazine days before Friday's attack, he had described how his life had resumed a degree of normality following his relocation from Britain.    - 'Appalled' -    ""Ever since I've been living in America... really there hasn't been a problem in all that time,"" he said.  The stabbing triggered international outrage from politicians, literary figures and ordinary people.  US President Joe Biden called it a ""vicious"" attack and praised Rushdie for ""his refusal to be intimidated or silenced."" British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled.""  But the attack also drew applause from Islamist hardliners in Iran and Pakistan.  On Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Iranian state media had ""gloated"" about the attack. ""This is despicable,"" he said in a statement.   Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

The People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which has ruled the oil-rich nation for nearly five decades, has claimed a ""comfortable majority"" in this week's vote.  Final results have still not been announced.  But after 97 percent of the results were tallied, an initial count late Thursday showed the MPLA had won 51.07 percent of the votes.  It gave its main rival, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), 44.05 percent in the Wednesday polls.  UNITA leader Adalberto Costa Junior late Friday said his party ""does not recognise the provisional results"".  He said the opposition party had conducted its own vote tallying and had noted discrepancies.  Costa Junior called for an international panel to review the count.  ""We can affirm with complete assurance that the MPLA did not win the elections,"" he told a cheering crowd of supporters.    - 'Political turbulence' -    The MPLA has traditionally wielded control over the electoral process and state media, and opposition and civic groups have in recent days raised fears of voter tampering.  The Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU) raised concerns ranging from a shortfall of national observers to questions about the electoral roll and biased reporting by state-owned television.   The SADC said voting was ""peaceful, calm and well organised"", but some polling stations opened and closed at irregular hours.  It urged anybody with objections to the results ""to channel their concerns through established legal procedures"".  The AU, meanwhile, noted ""some limitation on the right to access information and the freedom of press"".  The MPLA, a former liberation movement, has ruled Angola since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975.  But it has seen a steady decline in support in recent elections.  While it romped to victory with 71.84 percent of votes in 2012, it only garnered 61 percent five years after that.  UNITA scored 26.67 percent in the 2017 elections, contesting the official count then too.  Alex Vines, of the UK-based think tank Chatham House, earlier predicted Costa Junior's party would object.  ""We can expect... some months of political turbulence,"" he said.    - 'End corruption' -    Augusto Santana, of the non-profit Democracy Works Foundation, said protests could break out over the weekend.   ""UNITA is not happy because they think they have won the elections,"" he said.  The latest election has been overshadowed by a struggling economy, inflation, poverty, drought and the death in Spain last month of Lourenco's predecessor, Jose Eduardo dos Santos.  The opposition has proved popular in urban areas, winning in the capital Luanda and among youth disaffected with the ruling party.  ""The people have voted en masse for UNITA, and to end the vicious circle of corruption that plagues the country,"" said Gilson Leopoldo, a 26-year-old accountant in Luanda.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza has also nurtured corruption and nepotism.  Santana said the opposition was unlikely to manage to overturn the results.  But it could still usher in a ""new era of politics"", with more UNITA lawmakers making it into parliament.  Marisa Lourenco, a Johannesburg-based independent analyst, said times were changing.  ""This is the last election the MPLA will win outright,"" she said.  clt-ub-giv/sn/ah","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

The future 46th President of the United States was accompanied by his wife Jill Biden, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell and House leader Kevin McCarthy.  Violinist Patricia Treacy, soprano Renée Fleming and the St. Augustine Gospel Choir were to perform during the mass.  Biden, 78, will be sworn in shortly before noon (1700 GMT) outside the Capitol, which was targeted in a deadly assault by pro-Trump protesters exactly two weeks ago.

His impeachment trial is now scheduled to take place in the Senate, but the date has not yet been set.   McCarthy and McConnell, long loyal allies of the Republican billionaire, had harsh words for him after the Capitol attack.  McCarthy said Trump ""bears responsibility"" for inciting the riot and should have immediately denounced the crowd when he saw what was happening -- but added that he thought impeachment was a ""mistake,"" and voted against it.  McConnell, in a resounding break with Trump, did not rule out finding the president guilty at the Senate trial.

On a frigid but sunny day at the very Capitol building that was assaulted on January 6, Biden was sworn in moments after Kamala Harris became America's first woman vice president, closing the book on Donald Trump's tumultuous four years.  ""Democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,"" Biden said before a National Mall that was virtually empty due to the ultra-tight security and a raging Covid-19 pandemic that he vowed to confront immediately.  ""We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility and we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes,"" he said.  ""Together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear, of unity, not division, of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing and goodness.""  But Trump, who falsely said that he was cheated out of a second term and egged on his supporters before their rampage at the Capitol, broke 152 years of tradition by refusing to attend his successor's inauguration.  Biden -- vice president for eight years under Barack Obama -- appealed to supporters of Trump, who shattered political norms by ruthlessly belittling rivals, denouncing entire ethnic groups and trying to cast doubt on basic facts.  ""I will be a president for all Americans,"" the veteran Democrat said.  But Biden confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as evidenced during Trump's presidency by the Capitol mob, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants, and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.  The United States faces ""a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat,"" Biden said.  ""Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear and demonization have long torn us apart.""    - Historic firsts -    At 78, Biden is the oldest-ever US president, a job he first sought in 1987. He is only the second Roman Catholic president and swore his oath on a bulging old family Bible.   Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history and the first person of color as the nation's number two.   She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever ""second gentleman"" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who was seen luring the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers in a video that went viral.  Central Washington took on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat. The Supreme Court reported a bomb threat Wednesday morning.  With the public essentially barred from attending due to the pandemic, Biden's audience at the National Mall instead was 200,000 flags planted to represent the absent crowds.  Biden nonetheless brought in celebrity power -- absent four years ago with Trump. Lady Gaga, in a dress with a black bodice and a billowing red skirt, sang the national anthem and Tom Hanks prepared to host a televised evening appearance with the new president.  Jennifer Lopez sang a pop rendition of ""This Land is Your Land,"" often considered the unofficial US national anthem, ending it by exclaiming the final words of the pledge of allegiance -- ""one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"" -- in Spanish.  The new first lady, Jill Biden, invited a 22-year-old poet, Amanda Gorman, who became a star of the day with verse on how democracy ""can never be permanently defeated.""    - Immediate actions -    Biden and Harris immediately paid their respects to fallen soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery and then arrived at the White House following a somber, crowdless parade escorted by the Army fife and drum corps clad in the red coats of George Washington's time.  Biden plans to kick off his presidency with a flurry of 17 orders including rejoining the Paris climate accord, ending the US exit from the World Health Organization, rescinding a ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority nations and halting construction of Trump's cherished wall on the Mexican border.  Biden, who has vowed a major escalation of vaccination against Covid, warned that the ""toughest and deadliest period"" was still ahead from the pandemic that has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the United States, more than in any other country.  ""We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation,"" he said, striking a new tone after Trump's mockery of mask-wearing and business closings meant to halt the virus.  Many overseas leaders breathed a sigh of relief at the end of Trump's hawkish, go-it-alone presidency, with Biden's team pledging greater cooperation with the rest of the world.  With so many domestic challenges, Biden delved little in his inaugural address into foreign policy, a longtime passion for the former senator, but said: ""We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.""    - Trump vows to be back -    Trump left Washington hours before the inauguration, walking on a red carpet on the White House lawn with his wife Melania into the Marine One presidential helicopter, which flew near the inauguration-ready Capitol before heading to Andrews Air Force Base.  ""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters in a campaign-style event before leaving for his Florida resort in his last trip on Air Force One.  ""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.  Neither Trump nor Biden said each other's name. In a first hint of graciousness, Trump wished the next administration ""great luck and great success"" -- and a spokesman said he maintained one tradition by leaving a letter for Biden.  Mike Pence, the outgoing vice president who clashed with Trump in his final days by acknowledging he could not overturn the election, attended the inauguration and was spotted laughing with Harris.  Also taking part were former presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and their wives -- including Hillary Clinton, for whom Biden's victory was especially sweet four years after her narrow, surprise defeat to Trump.  In the middle of his last night at the White House, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 73 people including his former campaign chief Steve Bannon, who was charged with defrauding donors who thought they were building Trump's wall.  Trump in a final act lifted a ban on his administration's officials working as lobbyists -- an order he had issued at the start of his presidency as he vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington.  bur-sct/sst",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

She added that the Senate will need to determine the structure of a trial of Trump, who would be the first ex-president ever to face such a process in Congress.

Biden however made national unity a key theme of his inaugural address Wednesday, saying ""we must end this uncivil war"" that pits Americans with different political beliefs against one another.  But Pelosi dismissed questions about whether proceeding with a trial would do more harm than good by undercutting Biden's unity message.  ""I'm not worried about that. The fact is, the president of the United States committed an act of incitement of insurrection,"" she said.   ""I don't think it's very unifying to say, 'Oh, let's just forget it and move on,'"" she added. ""That's not how you unify.""  The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, has left the door open for supporting a conviction of Trump, but several in his caucus have spoken out against a trial.  Putting Trump on trial would only ""open up Pandora's box,"" Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the former president, told Fox News on Wednesday hours after Biden's inauguration.

According to family members quoted by Russian media, Dugin -- a vocal supporter of Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine -- was the likely target of the blast as his daughter borrowed his car at the last minute.  Daria Dugina, born in 1992, was killed when a bomb placed in her Toyota Land Cruiser went off as she drove on a highway near the village of Bolshie Vyzyomy, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside Moscow, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.  Dugina died on the scene and a homicide investigation has been opened, said the committee, which probes major crime cases in Russia.  Dugin, sometimes called  ""Putin's Rasputin"" or ""Putin's brain,"" is an outspoken Russian ultranationalist intellectual.  He has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking territories in a vast new Russian empire and wholeheartedly supported Moscow's operation in Ukraine.   He was put on a Western sanctions list after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a move he also backed.  The head of one of Ukraine's breakaway separatist regions blamed the blast on Kyiv authorities.

The weeklong suspension of uploading or streaming live video to Trump's channel had been set to lift on the eve of President-elect Joe Biden taking the oath of office.  ""In light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, the Donald J. Trump channel will be prevented from uploading new videos or livestreams for an additional minimum of seven days,"" YouTube said in response to an AFP inquiry.  ""As we shared previously, comments will continue to be indefinitely disabled under videos from the channel.""  Trump's access to the social media platforms he has used as a megaphone during his presidency has been largely cut off since a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington DC on January 6.  Operators say the embittered leader could use his accounts to foment more unrest aimed at Biden's inauguration on Wednesday.  YouTube last week suspended Trump's channel ""for at least seven days"" and removed a video for violating its policy against inciting violence, joining other social media platforms in banning his accounts after the deadly Capitol riot.  Facebook suspended Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts following the violent invasion of the US Capitol, which temporarily disrupted the certification of Biden's election victory.  In announcing the suspension, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said Trump used the platform to incite violence and was concerned he would continue to do so.   Twitter went a step further by deleting Trump's account, depriving him of his favorite platform. It was already marking his tweets disputing the election outcome with warnings.  Trump also was hit with suspensions by services like Snapchat and Twitch.   Trump, who has not appeared in public for a week, broke days of silence on Tuesday with a pre-recorded farewell video address uploaded to a White House channel at YouTube.  Trump for the first time asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming Biden administration -- a change of tune from weeks spent persuading his huge number of Republican followers that the Democrat cheated in their election battle.  Trump has yet to personally congratulate Biden on his win or invite him for the customary cup of tea in the Oval Office.  The supporters of Trump who attacked the US Capitol were ""provoked"" by the president and ""fed lies,"" Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.  Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6 following a speech by the president outside the White House in which he repeated his false claims to have won the election.  At least five people died in the mayhem.  The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives impeached Trump on January 13 for ""inciting insurrection"" and he faces a potential trial in the Senate after he leaves office on Wednesday.  gc/jh   GOOGLE    FACEBOOK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

It was unclear how many passengers and crew were aboard the Boeing 737-500, which has a capacity of about 130, when it left Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta international airport Saturday afternoon.  The usual flight time is about 90 minutes over the Java Sea between Java island and Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo island.  Data from FlightRadar24 said the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  ""Sriwijaya Air flight #SJ182 lost more than 10,000 feet of altitude in less than one minute, about 4 minutes after departure from Jakarta,"" the tracking agency said on its official Twitter account.  Broadcaster Kompas TV quoted local fishermen as saying they had found debris near islands off the coast of Jakarta, but it could not be immediately confirmed as having belonged to the missing jet.  Indonesia's transport ministry said it was probing the incident.  ""A Sriwijaya (Air) plane from Jakarta to Pontianak (on Borneo island) with call sign SJY182 has lost contact,"" said ministry spokesman Adita Irawati.  ""It last made contact at 2:40 pm (0740 GMT).""  The budget airline, which has about 19 Boeing jets that fly to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, said only it was investigating the loss of contact.  Indonesia's search and rescue agency and the National Transportation Safety Commission were also investigating, Irawati said.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and a subsequent fatal flight in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  bur-pb/jfx   BOEING",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

The 38-year-old former ragga singer said his party's polling agents were beaten and chased away in parts of northern and western Uganda, that ballot boxes were opened and stuffed, and that some voters were only given ballots for the parliamentary election.  Museveni, 76, is seeking a sixth term after almost four decades in power, and the youthful Wine has emerged his main rival in a country where most have known only one president.  The internet remained down for a third day as vote counting continued from Thursday's poll, with provisional results from 29 percent of polling stations giving Museveni an early lead of 63.9 percent while Wine trailed with 28 percent.  ""I am very confident that we defeated the dictator by far. I call upon all Ugandans to reject the blackmail. We have certainly won the election and we've won it by far,"" Wine told journalists.  ""Whatever is being declared is a complete sham we reject it and we dissociate ourselves with it.""  Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, listed a host of irregularities in different districts and promised to provide video evidence once the internet was restored.   He said he would announce a strategy in coming hours  Election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said he did ""not appreciate the assertion that these results we are reading out are rigged"".  ""The onus is on candidate Kyagulanyi to show how votes are rigged.""  On Friday morning the capital Kampala was quiet and some businesses remained closed, while soldiers and police patrolled on foot.  Full results are expected by Saturday afternoon.  - Ghetto president -    Museveni faced a total of 10 candidates, but it is the popularity of the former popstar Wine, who grew up in a slum and is nicknamed the ""ghetto president"", that has rattled the former rebel leader.  The poll followed one of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and scores of deaths.  However Byabakama said the vote had gone off in a ""peaceful and tranquil manner"".  Police spokesman Fred Enanga said there had been ""no major cases of violence reported"".  A senior foreign diplomat told AFP there had been sporadic incidents of violence and many irregularities but no sign of mass manipulation.     - Observers denied -    The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  The United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, cancelled a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  Wine has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.  Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  He has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the median age is 16, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  But Museveni, one of Africa's longest serving leaders, has never lost an election and observers expect this time around will be no different.  His opponents -- most visibly Wine, who spent much of the campaign in a bulletproof vest and combat helmet -- were arrested, blocked from rallying and dispersed with tear gas throughout the campaign.  Two days of protests in November led to the deaths of 54 people.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

In a statement, Biden signaled the firmness of Washington's commitment to Ukraine's struggle, saying the $2.98 billion for arms and other equipment aimed ""to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.""   The new funds will be for air defense systems, artillery and the much-in-demand ammunition for those systems, as well as radars and systems to counter Russian drones, Biden said.  Congratulating Ukraine on its independence, which was declared from the Soviet Union in 1991, Biden said the US ""is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty.""  ""Today is not only a celebration of the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains -- and will remain -- a sovereign and independent nation.""  Biden also hailed Ukraine's resistance against the invasion, which President Vladimir Putin launched on February 24 after years of unsuccessfully trying to reassert Russian control over a westward-looking country that has pushed strongly for membership in NATO and the European Union.  Thousands of soldiers on both sides and thousands of civilians have died in the largest-scale battles seen in Europe since World War II. Despite Russian expectations of a quick victory, Ukrainian armed forces, which are trained and armed by Western allies, have pushed the invaders back to a swath of territory in the country's east and south.  ""Six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians' pride in themselves, in their country, and in their thirty-one years of independence,"" Biden said.  ""Today and every day, we stand with the Ukrainian people.""  However, despite rumors of a Ukrainian counter-offensive to try and retake large portions of occupied territory in the south, the battle lines remain largely frozen, indicating a possibly lengthy test of resolve for both sides, and also for Ukraine's Western backers.  The funds released by Biden Wednesday can be used for immediate war costs, including acquisitions of supplies and arms, and are separate from the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), under which Biden has been able to order transfers of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine's forces from existing US military stockpiles.  On Friday, the Pentagon announced the latest package under the PDA: $775 million worth of various missiles, artillery, and anti-armor weapons and ammunition, as well as a fleet of armed mine-removal vehicles.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The 27-nation bloc, which has accused Moscow of waging an ""energy war"", plans to cut gas consumption by 15 percent between August 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 to cope with the crisis.  A snapshot of national efforts so far:    - Public buildings -     Italy launched earlier this year what it called ""Operation Thermostat"" to try to lower heating and cut back on air conditioning in schools and public buildings.  France and Germany have also called on their public sectors to lead the way in saving power in the same way. In Germany, public buildings including the Bundestag, or parliament, will have to do without hot water.    - Closed doors, open shops -    In France shops that use air conditioning must keep their doors closed or face a fine.  And in Germany shops have launched an advertising campaign to inform customers that they can go inside, even if the doors are closed.  In Spain, since August 10 air conditioning has to be turned down and be set at no lower than 27 degrees Celsius (80.6 degrees Fahrenheit) during the warmest months of the year, in rules affecting everything from public transport to shops, offices, theatres and cinemas.   The legislation also affects heating in winter, when temperatures can be set no higher than 19C.   By the end of September, any air-conditioned or heated premises in Spain must have an automatic door-closing mechanism installed to avoid energy waste.    - Illuminated advertising -    In France, illuminated advertising screens will be banned between 1 am and 6 am, except in airports and railway stations. The ban which could soon be brought forward to 10 pm, mirroring Germany.  A two-square-metre digital LCD screen uses the equivalent of the average annual consumption of a household for lighting and household appliances, except heating.    - Swimming pools and saunas -    Germany has banned heating private swimming pools from September.  Several cities have lowered the temperature in their swimming pools and made cuts in urban lighting.  A housing cooperative in the eastern city of Dresden made national headlines when it announced it would limit hot water to certain times of day.   And Vonovia, Germany's largest property group, plans to limit the temperature in its 350,000 homes to 17 degrees Celsius at night.  In Finland people are being urged to spend less time in their beloved saunas.    - Public lighting -    In Vienna, there will be no Christmas lights this year on the Ring, the famous boulevard that encircles the centre of the Austrian capital.  And the lights at the Christmas market in the square in front of the city hall will only be switched on at night and not at dusk, about an hour later, on average, every day.  In Spain, from 10 pm shops have to switch off window-display lighting in a move also affecting the illumination of public buildings.   In Germany, the Bavarian city of Augsburg has turned off its fountains, dimmed the facades of public buildings at night and is debating switching off some under-used traffic lights.    - Small daily gestures -    Under its ""A degree lower"" campaign, Finland will from October encourage its citizens to turn down their radiators, take shorter showers and not heat their garages.  Germany's summer campaign involved encouraging buying more water-efficient shower heads.  burs-rap/jmy/rl",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Images from the scene showed the walls on the top four or five storeys of the residential building in the heart of the La Latina neighbourhood had been blown out, with vast quantities of debris spreading far and wide.   Government representative Jose Manuel Franco told Spain's public television that the blast occurred as a team of workmen were repairing the building's boiler.  Speaking at the scene, Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said an 85-year-old woman had died along with a man whose age was not immediately clear, while the third victim was still ""under the rubble"".  Bulgaria's foreign ministry announced late Wednesday a 47-year-old Bulgarian man was among those killed.   Another 11 people were injured, one of whom was in serious condition. Church sources told AFP it was a recently-ordained priest.   Despite the force of the blast, no one was hurt in the elderly care home next door, nor in an adjacent school where tonnes of rubble fell into the playground while the children were in lessons, city officials said.   Wednesday was the first day that schools reopened after a nine-day closure due to the heaviest snowfall in Madrid in 50 years.  ""This could have been a massive tragedy,"" said Martinez-Almeida.    Along the street, at least 15 cars were badly damaged by the force of the explosion, which gutted most of the six-storey residential building.  ""I was just leaving a nearby clinic when I heard a very big explosion, it was so big I thought it was a bomb,"" Valentin Moreno, a 48-year-old salesman, told AFP.   ""There were people running and a lot of smoke and when I got there, I saw the building's facade had been completely destroyed.""  Franco confirmed it was a ""gas explosion"" and said there were three dead and one missing, indicating the toll could rise further.  Hundreds of police and rescuers filled the streets around the building, which the archdiocese said housed local priests who worked in the area.    - 'Pray there are no victims' -    ""Please pray there are no victims,"" tweeted the Virgin de la Paloma parish church, saying ""one lay person has not been found"".  ""These were the living quarters for the local parish priests. They are being treated by the ambulance crews and out of danger,"" it said.

Nine fire crews and 11 ambulances were dispatched to the scene which was completely closed off to traffic and pedestrians, AFP correspondents said.   Three hours after the explosion occurred, smoke and flames could still be seen emerging from the building as a police helicopter flew overhead, an AFP correspondent said.     - 'Our wall caved in' -    Aerial footage released by police appeared to show that the top four or five floors had been completely blown out, with the blast also bringing down the wall of a building in Puerta de Toledo square, some 50 metres (165 feet) away, he said.

The incident on the flight out of Denver -- which quickly returned to the airport after part of the engine caught fire and broke off -- prompted United and other airlines to ground the planes with the same Pratt & Whitney engine.  While no one was injured in the Denver incident, the episode is the latest setback for Boeing, which only recently resumed deliveries of the long-grounded 737 MAX following two fatal crashes of that plane.  Shares of Boeing shook off early weakness Monday as aviation experts said the incident mostly raised pointed questions about Pratt & Whitney and United over engine maintenance.  ""It's nothing like the MAX,"" said Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia. ""After all these years of service it is unlikely to be a design issue with the engine, certainly it is something to do with maintenance.""  Boeing said all 128 of the 777 models with Pratt & Whitney engines were grounded following Saturday's emergency landing of United flight 328 to Hawaii.   ""I have just had confirmation that all the 777s equipped with this engine have been grounded,"" a spokeswoman for the planemaker told AFP in a text message on Monday.   Of the 128 planes, 69 were in service and 59 had been in storage. Carriers removing the planes from service were: United Airlines (24), Japan Airlines (13), All Nippon (19), Asiana (7) and Korean Air (6).  British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a temporary ban on jets with Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 series engines from entering UK airspace.  ""I will continue to work closely with the (UK Civil Aviation Authority) to monitor the situation,"" he tweeted.    - Engine on fire -    The Denver incident comes on heels of a similar problem in Japan in December.  A video shot from inside the United aircraft -- which had 229 passengers and 10 crew on board -- showed the right engine ablaze and wobbling on the wing of the Boeing 777-200.  Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered extra inspections of some passenger jets after the incident.   ""I have directed them to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines,"" FAA chief Steve Dickson said in a statement.  Dickson said a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades, which were unique to the model and only used on 777 planes.   Officials from the FAA met with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives on Sunday evening, he added.  The US National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) said a preliminary investigation indicated two fan blades fractured on the number 2 engine on the plan.  ""The airplane sustained minor damage,"" the NTSB said in a statement Sunday. ""The examination and documentation of the airplane is ongoing.""  Pratt & Whitney said it was cooperating with the NTSB probe and ""will continue to work to ensure the safe operation of the fleet.""  United said Sunday it was removing the aircraft from its schedule, ""and will continue to work closely with regulators to determine any additional steps.""  Japan's transport ministry earlier said it had ordered stricter inspections of engines after a Japan Airlines 777 plane flying from Haneda to Naha experienced trouble with ""an engine in the same family"" in December.  Asiana Airlines, South Korea's second-largest carrier, also said it would not fly any of its seven currently operational 777s.     - Navigating industry downturn -    The engine failure is unwelcome news for Boeing, which only recently resumed deliveries of the 737 MAX following a 20-month global grounding after two tragic crashes killed 346 people.  The MAX began returning to commercial service in late 2020, a time when commercial airline travel remains depressed due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Boeing executives said last month they expect it will take about three years for activity to return to pre-pandemic levels.  Michel Merluzeau, an expert at consultancy AIR, agreed the latest problem did not appear to result from poor plane design by the aerospace giant.  ""It's not really a problem for Boeing,"" he said. ""It's more an issue of maintenance -- how United or Pratt & Whitney is maintaining engines that have been in use for a while.""  Shares of Boeing recovered from early losses, rising 0.6 percent to $218.76, while Pratt & Whitney's parent company Raytheon Technologies fell 0.3 percent to $74.07.  United jumped 7.1 percent to $51.43, joining other carriers in rallying after a positive note from Deutsche Bank about the industry's prospects amid improving Covid-19 trends.  jul-jmb/hs     BOEING    GOL LINHAS AERAS INTELIGENTES    UNITED TECHNOLOGIES    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Here are five things to know about the East African nation:     - Pearl of Africa -    Uganda is landlocked, straddling the equator roughly 800 kilometres (500 miles) inland from the Indian Ocean and borders five nations -- South Sudan to the north, Rwanda and Tanzania to the south, Kenya to the east, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the west.  Though it has no access to the sea, Uganda is in the middle of Africa's Great Lakes region and is nearly one-fifth water. It boasts a long shoreline on Lake Victoria, is criss-crossed by a major tributary of the Nile, and sources most of its electricity from hydropower.  It is roughly the same size as the United Kingdom, encompassing some 241,000 square kilometres (93,000 square miles) of misty rainforests, great lakes and swamps, plateaus and snow-capped mountains -- a natural diversity that earned Uganda the colonial-era moniker the ""Pearl of Africa"".  Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a tranche of ancient forest in the country's southwest, is home to half the world's mountain gorillas while Mount Stanley, on the border with DRC, is Africa's third-highest peak at 5,109 metres (16,762 feet).    - Young population -    Britain's protectorate in Uganda was forged in 1894 from a group of neighbouring and sometimes rival kingdoms, including the dominant Buganda kingdom in the south and Bunyoro in the northwest.  Christian missionaries had arrived not long before, as did the first British explorers seeking the source of the Nile. Today, three-quarters of Uganda follows Christianity, and English and Swahili are the official languages though the country is multilingual.  Uganda is one of the youngest countries in the world, with a median age of 15.9 years. Nearly half its 45 million people are 14 or under, while just two percent are aged over 65.  It is also growing quickly. The population has nearly doubled since the turn of the century and the fertility rate remains among the world's highest, with about five children born to every woman, according to the UN Population Fund.    - Black gold -    But the economy struggles to keep up. About 700,000 young people reach working age every year -- a figure set to rise to one million by 2030 -- but only 75,000 new jobs are created for them.  The World Bank says this disparity, if left unaddressed, will keep most young Ugandans locked in poor-quality jobs or unpaid work on the family farm, while dragging on growth and efforts to diversify the economy.  Uganda is blessed with fertile soils and most of the country is engaged in agriculture, with coffee, vegetables, tea and fish among the top exports.  But the discovery of an estimated 1.7 billion barrels of oil in the northwest Lake Albert region has buoyed hopes of boosting economic growth and stemming reliance on foreign aid, though environmental and social concerns have been raised.    - Troubled neighbourhood -     Nestled in one of Africa's most volatile regions, Uganda has been involved in numerous armed and bloody conflicts at home and abroad since achieving independence from Britain in 1962.  Ugandan troops have fought two wars in DRC, clashed with Rwandan forces, backed government soldiers in South Sudan, and hunted rebel movements both inside their borders and beyond in places like Central African Republic and eastern Congo.   President Yoweri Museveni, who took power at the head of a rebel army in 1986, has tried to position himself as something of a regional statesman and peace broker, but has faced allegations of meddling and UN accusations that his forces committed war crimes in DRC.  An ally of the United States in its global ""war on terror"", Ugandan soldiers have served as guards under US command in Iraq, and since 2007 have been the largest contingent of African soldiers in Somalia fighting the Islamist militants Al-Shabaab.    - Open doors -    Uganda has a long history of accepting refugees from over its borders, and hosts more civilians fleeing persecution than anywhere else in Africa.  Uganda's refugee population has tripled since mid-2016 and is now approximately 1.4 million -- one for roughly every 30 of its citizens -- mostly from South Sudan and DRC.  Bidibidi, a sprawling refugee settlement in the country's north, houses 250,000 people, rivalling most Ugandan cities in population.   Uganda's refugee policy is relatively progressive, allowing the displaced to move freely and access jobs and land, but aid groups say they struggle to assist the ever-expanding population.  np/fb/dl","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Thousands of protesters defied government warnings to rally from Vladivostok to Saint Petersburg in a second weekend of mass demonstrations over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent.  Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning he blames on the Kremlin.  The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a Moscow detention centre and faces years of potential jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.  In moves not seen in years in Moscow, authorities locked down the centre of the capital Sunday, with hundreds of police lining the streets, central Metro stations closed and the movements of pedestrians restricted.  Protesters who had hoped to gather outside the headquarters of the FSB security service were instead scattered to various parts of the city as organisers made last-minute changes in locations.  AFP journalists saw dozens of protesters detained and taken into police vans.     - US condemns 'harsh tactics' -    Several thousand were seen marching throughout the city centre, but it was unclear amid the chaos how many people took part in the demonstration.   Independent monitor OVD-Info said at least 4,407 people had been detained across the country, after reporting more than 4,000 detentions during similar protests on January 23.  It said at least 1,365 were detained in Moscow and 962 in Saint Petersburg, as well as 82 journalists across the country.   US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Twitter condemned ""the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists by Russian authorities for a second week straight.""  The Russian foreign ministry hit back, accusing the United States of ""gross interference"" in its affairs and of using ""online platforms controlled by Washington"" to promote the protests.  Protesters chanted ""Freedom!"" and ""Putin is a thief!"" as they marched through Moscow, braving bitter cold and snow.   Several hundred protesters eventually gathered outside the Matrosskaya Tishina prison where Navalny is being held. Dozens were detained outside the complex.  ""It's almost embarrassing that the state is so afraid of us,"" 31-year-old protester Elisaveta Dementieva told AFP at the Moscow demonstration.    - Golden toilet brushes -    Many protesters carried gold-painted toilet brushes in reference to a video released by Navalny's team alleging that Putin had been gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast, which among other luxurious goods featured toilet brushes costing 700 euros ($840) apiece.  As night fell in Moscow protesters began to head home, with some wondering whether the demonstration would have any impact.   ""It's true we are asking ourselves if these protests will really do any good,"" said Nadia, a 21-year-old student. ""It will take more for Navalny to be freed. And even more for Russia to be free.""  Several thousand people demonstrated in the second city of Saint Petersburg, despite police closing off the main thoroughfare Nevsky Prospekt and shutting Metro stations, an AFP journalist reported.   Police were seen roughly detaining several protesters, including one young man who was left with a bloodied head.  Earlier, protesters had rallied in cities including the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where dozens escaped the police on the frozen waters of the Amur Bay and danced in a circle.  Several thousand were also reported to have protested in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk despite temperatures dropping to -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).    - Navalny's wife detained -    Russian authorities issued several warnings against participating in the unauthorised rallies and threatened criminal charges against protesters.  The head of Russia's Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, called Sunday's events a ""provocation"" and said they have ""nothing to do with protecting rights"", news agency TASS reported.  Navalny is due in court several times next week, including on Tuesday on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.   His team has called for supporters to gather outside the courtroom.  Navalny's wife Yulia posted a picture of her family on Instagram on Sunday, urging supporters to make their voices heard.  ""If we remain silent, then tomorrow they will come for any one of us,"" she wrote.  Navalny's team said Yulia was detained by police shortly after she announced her arrival at Sunday's rally on social media.  tbm-mm/gd",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

With Spain still grappling with a third wave of coronavirus infections, the vote in the wealthy northeastern region was held under tight restrictions to reduce the risk of contagion.  With 99 percent of the votes counted, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists won the most votes but the three separatist parties together were set to get 74 seats in the 135-seat assembly.  That is up from 70 seats won in the last election in December 2017, just months after Catalonia's failed secession bid which led to the jailing of several separatist leaders.  To reduce the risk of virus transmission in the region, polling stations were set up in spacious venues like food markets, the area around FC Barcelona's football stadium and the bullring in Tarragona.  Voters had to wear face masks, use disinfectant gel provided at polling stations and stand apart while lining up in rainy weather to cast their ballots.  During the last hour of voting, which was reserved for people infected with Covid-19, polling station workers wore gloves, facial screens and white protective gowns.  The Socialists had 33 seats, up from 17 in the last vote when they finished fourth.  Sanchez had hoped the election -- Catalonia's fifth in a decade -- would end separatist rule in the region which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy.  He fielded his health minister Salvador Illa as his candidate in the hope that his high profile in the fight against the pandemic would help win votes.  While separatist parties have been deeply divided over strategy since the failed secession bid, they were not punished by voters and for the first time won over 50 percent of the vote, against 47.5 percent four years ago.  The more moderate ERC got 33 seats, the hardline JxC got 32 and the radical CUP nine seats.    - 'Amnesia' jibe -    The result leaves the ERC's main candidate, 38-year-old jurist Pere Aragones, best placed to become Catalonia's next leader.  ""We have stopped an operation by the (Spanish) state to expel separatists from institutions,"" he said after the results were announced.   Illa had argued it was ""time to turn the page"" after over a decade of Catalan nationalists governments focusing on separatism but Aragones dismissed his approach during the campaign as ""amnesia"".  He has said his party would not turn the page while independence leaders remained in jail over the failed secession bid.  Catalonia is currently governed by a coalition led by JxC, which is prone to confrontation with Madrid, and the ERC, which is open to dialogue and has helped Sanchez's minority government pass laws at the national level.    - 'We are afraid' -    The anti-coronavirus measures appeared to discourage people from voting.  While some 5.5 million people were eligible to vote, turnout was a record low at 54.4 percent, down from almost 80 percent in the last election.  ""I hesitated until the last minute whether to come vote or not,"" Cristina Caballero, a 34-year-old child educator, told AFP at a Barcelona polling station.  ""I think these elections should have been postponed.""  The regional government tried to put off the election until the end of May because of the pandemic but the courts blocked that move.  While more than 40 percent of the 82,000 people assigned to help staff polling stations on the day had asked to be recused, all polling stations were operating normally as of noon, according to the Catalan government.  Still, some people picked for polling station duty expressed concern.  ""Of course we are afraid, I just had cancer and am still on sick leave, but I was called up,"" Eva Vizcaino, a 54-year-old office worker, told AFP at a Barcelona polling station.

Here are some of the main dates punctuating Trump's political career:  - First moves -    January 25, 2017: Trump signs an executive order ordering construction to begin on the wall he promised to build on the southern US border with Mexico, a key campaign promise he said Mexico would pay for. In the end only a few hundred miles were built, paid for by the US.  January 27, 2017: Trump issues an executive order banning entries from seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Amid outrage, the Supreme Court validates the text in the summer of 2018.  June 1, 2017: Trump declares that the US it is pulling out of the Paris climate agreement.    - Economy -     December 20, 2017: Republican-run Congress passes the biggest tax cuts in 31 years.  May 31, 2018: The US slaps tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico, Canada and the European Union.  June 15, 2018: Trump launches a trade war with China by slapping 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of imported goods.    September 2019: Unemployment hits its lowest level in 50 years, at 3.5 percent.    - Diplomacy -    December 6, 2017: The Trump administration recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, breaking with long standing US policy and drawing international condemnation.  May 8, 2018: The US withdraws from the international nuclear agreement with Iran and reestablishes US sanctions against the Islamic republic.  June 30, 2019: Trump becomes the first US leader to set foot in North Korea, a little more than a year after meeting the country's leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  October 27, 2019: Announcement that the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a US military raid in Syria.   January 3, 2020: The powerful Iranian general Qassem Soleimani is killed in a US air strike in Baghdad.     - Defeats -    July 28, 2017: The Senate fails to overturn Obamacare, the Democratic health care plan that Trump had vowed to abolish.  November 6, 2018: The opposition Democrats retake control of the House of Representatives. Republicans retain the Senate.  - Division -    August 12, 2017: During a rally of far-right activists in Charlottesville in Virginia, a neo-Nazi sympathizer drives his car into a group of anti-racist demonstrators, killing a woman. The president is heavily criticized when he declares there were ""fine people on both sides"" of the confrontation.  February 14, 2018: A 19-year-old former student opens fire in his old high school in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. The massacre sparks an unprecedented mobilization of young people calling for gun control. Trump wholeheartedly backs the rights of gun owners.  May 25, 2020: George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, dies during an arrest, triggering nationwide protests. Trump takes a law and order approach and calls the demonstrators thugs.    - Russia, Ukraine, impeachment -    May 17, 2017: Former FBI director Robert Mueller is appointed special counsel in charge of investigating whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to steal the 2016 election. Trump fumes at what he calls a ""witch hunt.""  April 18, 2019: The Mueller report is published without alleging a criminal conspiracy. But it points to frequent contacts between the Trump campaign and Kremlin-linked figures, who were found to have interfered in Trump's favor. Mueller cites numerous examples of Trump obstructing the investigation.  December 18, 2019: Trump is impeached on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for trying to coerce Ukraine into smearing his future Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump is acquitted in his trial in the Republican-controlled Senate on February 5.     - Coronavirus and campaigning -    January 31, 2020: The US announces a ban on non-American travelers entering from China to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The ban is extended to European countries on March 14 as the country shuts itself off from the world.   October 2, 2020: After testing positive for the virus, Trump is admitted to a military hospital for treatment, emerging three days later with a claim that he is now ""immune"".  November 3, 2020: Americans elect Biden to succeed Trump, who refuses to concede defeat and spends two months spreading baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud and lying that he won by a landslide.  January 6, 2021: Trump tells his supporters to march on Congress and ""fight like hell"" as lawmakers certify Biden's victory. An armed mob storms the US Capitol and five people die in the ensuing mayhem. A week later, Trump becomes the first US president to be impeached twice as the House charges him with inciting an insurrection.   bur-cyj/jh/st/dw/ft",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

A 17-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces during a late Monday raid in the flashpoint West Bank district of Jenin.   Islamic Jihad identified the teenager as Dirar al-Kafrayni, and said he was a member of the group and ""our heroic martyr"".  The army said it had operated alongside police, who arrested ""two wanted terror suspects.""  A Palestinian security source, who requested anonymity, told AFP that one of those detained was Bassem al-Saadi, a senior figure in Islamic Jihad's political wing in the West Bank.  The source identified the second person detained as Saadi's son-in-law, a Jenin-based fundraiser for the militant group.   The Israeli military said it was preventing civilian access to areas near Gaza ""due to a direct threat"".  ""After terrorist activities were identified with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation, it was decided to block off areas and routes adjacent to the Gaza Strip security fence,"" an army statement said.  Israel also closed its only border crossing for people entering or leaving Gaza, while the government said Prime Minister Yair Lapid was reviewing security.  As news of the deadly raid spread, crowds began to gather in Jenin refugee camp and the nearby city of Nablus, as supporters voiced solidarity with Islamic Jihad.  ""We declare alertness and raise the readiness of our mujahideen (fighters),"" the group said in a statement late Monday.  Saadi was injured by an Israeli army dog during his arrest, the Palestinian source said.   Home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, Gaza has been under Israeli blockade since 2007 when Islamist group Hamas ousted forces loyal to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.  Islamic Jihad, a militant group with close links to Iran, has a strong presence in Gaza, regularly using it as a launchpad for rocket attacks against Israel.   The latest unrest comes amid rising violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   At least 55 Palestinians have been killed since late March, mostly in the West Bank.  They have included suspected militants and also non-combatants, among them Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American dual national, who was covering an Israeli raid in Jenin.  Attacks on Israeli targets have killed 19 people over the same period, most of them civilians killed in attacks inside Israel.

By the time nightfall had forced the suspension of the search, seven bodies had been found while officials said between 125 and 200 people remained unaccounted for.  Earlier in the day a glacier on the Nanda Devi national park broke up and fell into Dhauliganga river, setting off the high-speed floods that engulfed everything in their path.  Videos shared online by terrified residents showed the water tearing down cranes at a power plant and smashing up bridges and roads further downstream.  Dozens of workers in two power plants on the Rishiganga dam were missing and local inhabitants were swept away as they tended their cattle.  Uttarakhand state chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that at least 125 were unaccounted for, but added that the number could increase.  State police chief Ashok Kuma earlier said there were 200 missing from the two power plants alone.    - 'Like an earthquake' -  About 20 workers were trapped inside one tunnel but 12 were rescued.  With the main road washed away, the tunnel was filled with sludge and rocks, and rescuers were forced to climb down a hillside on ropes to gain access to the entrance.  ""There was a cloud of dust as the water went by. The ground shook like an earthquake,"" local inhabitant Om Agarwal told Indian TV.   Hundreds of troops and paramilitaries along with military helicopters and other aircraft have been sent to the region.  Authorities emptied two dams to stop the flood waters reaching the Ganges at the towns of Rishikesh and Haridwar, where authorities barred people from going near the banks of the river, officials said.  Villages on hillsides overlooking the sacred river were evacuated, but authorities later said the main flood danger had passed.    - 'Grim reminder' -  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was monitoring the relief operation.  ""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone's safety there,"" he said on Twitter.  Fourteen glaciers overlook the river from the Nanda Devi park, where fears over climate change and deforestation have mounted in recent years.  International experts say about a quarter of the ice on Himalayan glaciers have been lost over the past four decades because of increased temperatures.  ""Avalanches are common phenomena in the catchment area,"" M.P.S. Bisht, director of the Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, told AFP. ""Huge landslides also frequently occur.""  The increased pace of development in the poor Himalayan regions has also heightened fears about fallout from deforestation and other environmental troubles.  Devastating monsoon floods and landslides in Uttarakhand in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of projects in the state, particularly in isolated areas like those around the Rishi Ganga dam.  Former water resources minister Uma Bharti said she had called for a freeze on hydro-electric projects in ""sensitive"" Himalayan areas such as the Ganges and its tributaries when in government.  Vimlendhu Jha, founder of Swechha, an environmental group, said the disaster was a ""grim reminder"" of the effects of climate change and the ""haphazard development of roads, railways and power plants in ecologically sensitive areas.""

Beijing, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory to one day be reclaimed, by force if necessary, was enraged by the trip by Pelosi -- the highest-profile elected US official to visit the island in 25 years.  It vowed ""punishment"" and state TV said it began military drills, including live-fire exercises, at 0400 GMT in several areas encircling Taiwan.  Late Thursday, Japan's foreign minister Hayashi called for an ""immediate stop"" to the exercises.  ""China's actions this time have a serious impact on the peace and stability of the region and the international community. I once again demand the immediate stop of these military exercises,"" Hayashi told reporters.  His comments came after the Japanese defence minister said five Chinese ballistic missiles fired during the exercises were ""believed to have landed within Japan's (exclusive economic zone)"".   EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, also in Phnom Penh, condemned the Chinese response.  ""There is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait. It is normal and routine for legislators from our countries to travel internationally,"" he tweeted.  Kung Phoak, Cambodia's deputy foreign minister and ASEAN spokesman, urged both sides to stabilise the situation.   ""We hope de-escalation happens... and normalcy returns to the Taiwan Strait,"" he told reporters.    - 'Miscalculation' fear -    ASEAN is split between countries with close ties to China, such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, and others that are more wary of Beijing and its growing international assertiveness.   But no ASEAN country formally recognises Taiwan and none has shown an appetite for backing Taipei against China.  The ministers' statement -- which avoided referring to Taiwan by name -- said ASEAN ""stands ready to play a constructive role in facilitating peaceful dialogue"", though it is not clear either side is interested in outside mediation.  While Wang and Blinken are not scheduled to meet bilaterally, they will both attend a meeting Friday of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a 27-member body set up to discuss security issues that also includes Russia and the EU.  Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who will also join the ARF gathering, said the fragile status quo in the Taiwan Strait must be maintained.  ""All parties should consider how they can contribute to de-escalating current tensions,"" Wong told AFP.  ""One of the risks the region is concerned about is the risk of miscalculation.""  Pelosi's visit and the flare-up over Taiwan have overshadowed the ASEAN meeting, which had been due to focus on the violent political crisis in Myanmar.  ASEAN has spearheaded so far fruitless diplomatic efforts to ease the turmoil that has flowed from last year's military coup.  Several members are growing increasingly angry at the junta's stonewalling tactics.  bur-pdw-rbu/aha",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113435201']

On the eve of Biden's inauguration, the Pew Research Center said 79 percent in Germany, 72 percent in France and 65 percent in Britain were confident that Biden would make the right decisions in world affairs.  It was a dramatic turnaround from Trump, who enjoyed the confidence of a mere 10 percent of Germans, 11 percent of French and 19 percent of Brits when the same question was asked in mid-2020.  But the survey also found widespread concerns about the overall health of US democracy after Trump contested his defeat with false allegations of voter fraud, culminating in a January 6 mob attack on the US Capitol and ultra-tight security for Biden's inauguration.  Some 73 percent of Germans, 64 percent of French and 62 percent of the British think the US political system needs major changes or complete reform, said the survey, which polled 3,066 adults from November 12 to December 23 -- before the Capitol attack.  Richard Wike, the director of global attitudes research at Pew, said the findings showed that the US image can bounce back -- much as Barack Obama enjoyed glowing approval in Europe after widespread criticism of his predecessor George W. Bush.  ""There's something of a reservoir of goodwill, I think, in these countries toward America that remains there even during times when people aren't very happy with the US or the president's foreign policies,"" he told reporters.  ""But what's going to happen this time around -- do these concerns about the health of American democracy start eroding the overall perception of the United States? I think those are open questions.""  Trump smashed through diplomatic protocol by openly criticizing the leaders of close allies -- especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose welcome to migrants he denounced.  The survey, however, found that even a narrow majority of supporters of Germany's far-right AfD party had a favorable view of Biden.  Biden's ratings were slightly lower in Britain than in Germany and France, which survey analysts said may be attributable to his open criticism of the country's exit from the European Union and firm stance on Northern Ireland.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The centre-right incumbent, who had been widely expected to win another term, took 61.6 percent of the vote, with almost all the results declared.  Socialist challenger Ana Gomes came in second with 12.24 percent of the vote, ahead of far-right candidate Andre Ventura in third.  In his victory speech Rebelo de Sousa pledged to make the fight against coronavirus his ""first priority"".  Portugal recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll on Sunday, with more than 85,000 infections and almost 1,500 deaths reported in the past week.   That is the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its population of more than 10 million, according to an AFP tally based on government figures.  Opinion polls had pointed to a first-round victory for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator known for candid moments like sharing a meal with homeless people and plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized.  Turnout reached 35.4 percent by 1600 GMT, only slightly lower than at the same time five years ago, soothing fears that abstentions might top 70 percent.  In the capital Lisbon, voters queued outside polling stations and were let in one by one under coronavirus social distancing rules.  ""To those who can and who want to vote, overcome your fears,"" Rebelo de Sousa said after casting his ballot in Celorico de Basto, his stronghold in the northern region of Minho.    - National lockdown -    One voter, architect Jose Barra, 54, told AFP: ""Nothing would have stopped me from voting, but I think elderly people, for example, will be discouraged both by the virus and by the queues.""  As mail-in ballots are not well-established in Portugal, early voting was available last Sunday, drawing nearly 200,000 voters.  Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at stemming a surge in coronavirus cases.  Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants.    - Keep it to one round -    The president has the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power.  In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round.  That would ""spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks"" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said.  ""An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable,"" the 72-year-old had warned.  Pre-election polls had given Rebelo de Sousa 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of Gomes and Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent.  A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way.    - Far-right challenge -    Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government.  He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist.  Meanwhile, Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- ""Enough"" -- had said he was in the running to ""crush the Left"", which fielded three out of the seven candidates.  Portugal has so far to a large degree not seen the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years.  Ventura -- an ally of Marine Le Pen and Italy's Matteo Salvini -- secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat in the 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.  ""For the first time, an openly anti-system party has disrupted the traditional right, with nearly half a million votes,"" he said Sunday as the ballots were being counted.  bur-tsc/har/to/rma/axn",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48861733']

The veteran leader, who took power in 1986, is one of Africa's longest serving presidents, and faced a stiff battle from the 38-year-old former ragga singer whose turn to politics fired up the youthful population.  Wine was under heavy guard at his home on the outskirts of Kampala as results were announced, with his party saying he was under ""effective house arrest"", while the government said it was merely providing him with security.  The singer-turned-MP was among 10 opposition candidates and came second with 34.8 percent of the votes, behind Museveni with 58.6 percent.  ""The electoral commission declares Yoweri Museveni... elected President of the republic of Uganda,"" said election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama.  He said turnout was 57.22 of almost 18 million registered voters.  Byabakama urged the population to ""remain calm and accept the outcome of these elections"" while reminding those celebrating to be mindful of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The election took place after one of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and the deaths of at least 54 people.  While the government said the vote went off peacefully, Wine alleged widespread fraud such as ballot box stuffing and said his party agents had in some places been beaten and chased away from polling stations.  ""Whatever is being declared is a complete sham, we reject it and we dissociate ourselves with it,"" he said on Friday.    - 'We don't control them' -    Wine's home remained sealed off by soldiers and police on Saturday, after he told AFP Friday evening that security forces had breached the fence around it and he felt under ""siege"".   ""They jumped over my fence. They came inside my compound. I feel threatened,"" said the 38-year-old.  The army's deputy spokesman Deo Akiiki said the soldiers were there for ""his own security and the security of people around him"".  However the spokesman for Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), Joel Ssenyonyi, NUP spokesman says Bobi Wine ""is under effective house arrest"", and did not rule out protests following the announcement of the vote.  ""People are angry because their vote has been stolen. They don't need me or Bobi Wine to tell them to get angry... Even we can't control them.""  Police have advised people not to go out to celebrate or protest when results are announced, citing draconian Covid-19 regulations, which have regularly been used to crack down on the opposition.  Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  Tibor Nagy, the top US diplomat for Africa, said on Twitter that the vote was ""fundamentally flawed"", citing the denial of accreditation to election observers and ""violence and harassment of opposition figures"".  ""We continue to urge restraint and rejection of violence by all actors as Uganda's election results are announced. The immediate and full restoration of Internet connectivity is essential.""  The internet has been down for four days, and government spokesman Ofwono Opondo said the measure was taken due to ""abuse, misuse, disinformation, fake news with the overall objective of undermining the integrity of the electoral process including the results... and possibly to cause destabilisation"".  He said the internet would be restored once the threat had passed, possibly on Monday morning.    - 35 years of Museveni -    Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote. He is one of Africa's longest serving leaders.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the average age is 16 and most have known only one president, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  Wine, with his humble origins in a slum and popular songs about economic and social injustice, struck a chord with young people, but observers said the odds were stacked against him with Museveni's powerful grip on the state.  His NUP is however on track to see his newly formed National Unity Platform (NUP) become the main opposition party in parliament, notably winning eight of nine constituencies in the capital Kampala.  The election took place with no major international observer missions aside from the African Union, with the United States saying too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the vote.  np-fb/wdb","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

On Sunday, Israel approved 780 new settler homes in the West Bank ahead of a March general election in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to face a fierce challenge from the right from pro-settler candidate Gideon Saar.  Peace Now said the government had now invited tenders for a further 2,112 units in the West Bank and 460 in east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope to make the capital of a future state.  The watchdog accused the government of a ""mad scramble to promote as much settlement activity as possible until the last minutes before the change of the administration in Washington"".  ""By doing so, Netanyahu is signalling to the incoming president that he has no intention of giving the new chapter in US-Israel relations even one day of grace, nor serious thought to how to plausibly resolve our conflict with the Palestinians,"" Peace Now said in a statement.  Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, said the Israeli move was equivalent to a ""race to eliminate what remains of the two-state solution, while posing more and more obstacles to the new US administration.""  Neighbouring Jordan condemned the decision.  ""The policy of colonisation... is neither legitimate nor legal,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Dhaifallah Ali al-Fayez.  ""It violates international law and undermines the foundations of peace, as well as efforts to reach a two-state solution,"" he said.    - Netanyahu facing right-wing challenge -    All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by much of the international community.  But Trump's administration, breaking with decades of US policy, declared in late 2019 that Washington no longer considered settlements as being in breach of international law.  Biden has indicated his administration will restore Washington's pre-Trump policy of opposing settlement expansion.  But on Tuesday his nominee for secretary of state said the incoming administration would not reverse Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  ""The only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,"" Antony Blinken said.  Beyond the change in Washington, experts say Netanyahu also has domestic political reasons for pushing settlement expansion.  Electioneering is intensifying ahead of Israel's March 23 vote, in which the country's longest-serving premier faces a new challenge from Saar, a prominent pro-settler voice who split with Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party late last year.  Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967 and has increasingly expanded the size and number of its settlements there, particularly under Netanyahu's leadership since 2009.  There are currently some 650,000 Jews living in east Jerusalem and the West Bank amid an estimated 3.1 million Palestinians.  Governments around the world see the settlements as one of the biggest obstacles to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  gl-cgo/jjm/lg/dv",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

Once the residence of French kings and among Europe's best-preserved monuments of its kind, the castle is for the most part open to the public, including for tours, concerts, theatre plays and other events.  It also houses part of the French armed forces' historical archives, to which access is restricted.  Each year some 150,000 people visit the chateau, paying 9.50 euros ($9.70) per adult admission.  But on July 28, two Russian women were refused access.  ""A guard at the metal detector asked to see my passport,"" said one of the women, 31, who works as a journalist and has been in France for five months, having left Russia ""because of the war"".  On inspecting the document, the guard informed her she couldn't pass, the woman, who asked not to be named, told AFP.  Another guard also denied her entry and gave as the reason ""because you are Russian"", she said, adding she couldn't believe what she was hearing.

Tuesday's vote in a swing district in upstate New York was to choose a candidate to serve the final months of Democrat Antonio Delgado's term in the House of Representatives, after he quit to become the Empire State's lieutenant governor.  The battle for New York's 19th congressional district comes two months after the Supreme Court sparked nationwide protests by ending the federally guaranteed right to abortion.  Democrat Pat Ryan, who has sought to turn the vote into a referendum on abortion access, was projected to win, according to US media including NBC, ABC and Fox News.  ""Choice was on the ballot. Freedom was on the ballot, and tonight choice and freedom won,"" Ryan tweeted after he was forecast to triumph.  ""We voted like our democracy was on the line because it is. We upended everything we thought we knew about politics and did it together.""  He has accused Republican rival Marc Molinaro and his party, who are against such access, of being ""too extreme on women's rights.""  There was no immediate response to his win from Molinaro, who had followed his party's main political talking points including on inflation and spiralling living costs in a campaign that has seen millions of dollars funneled into advertising.    - 'Right to choose on the ballot' -    President Joe Biden carried the district by fewer than two points in 2020, after Donald Trump took it by about seven points in 2016. Barack Obama won there in 2012.  Both candidates will be back on the ballot in November, but in different districts newly drawn in the latest round of redistricting.   The somewhat anachronistic system means Ryan -- who has yet to be nominated to fight for a seat in the midterms -- was on the ballot Tuesday in two districts for two separate seats for two different congresses.  New York also held several nominating contests -- known as primary elections -- including a vote pitting Democratic committee chairs Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney against one another.  Nadler handily won, taking 55.4 percent to 24.4 percent for Maloney with more than 95 percent of votes counted.  Maloney said she had congratulated Nadler on his win.  ""I share his progressive values. I wish him every success,"" she tweeted.  ""We must maintain a Democratic House and increase margins in the Senate to stop the extremists who are working to end our democracy,"" she added.  In Florida, Democrats picked congressman Charlie Crist as their candidate to challenge Governor Ron DeSantis in November.  ""Our fundamental freedoms are literally on the ballot, my friends,"" Crist said in his victory speech, vowing to end the White House hopes of DeSantis, who is tipped as a likely Republican hopeful in 2024.

The package aims to fortify Ukraine's military over the coming two years by committing the production and delivery of more advanced surface-to-air missiles, artillery ammunition, laser-guided rockets and advanced drones.  In a statement, Biden signaled the firmness of Washington's commitment to Ukraine's struggle, saying the funds aimed ""to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.""   Congratulating Ukraine on its independence, which was declared from the Soviet Union in 1991, Biden said the United States ""is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty.""  ""Today is not only a celebration of the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains -- and will remain -- a sovereign and independent nation.""  The White House said Biden planned to call Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday to congratulate him and update him on US security assistance.  The Pentagon said the billions of dollars for arms constituted a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that US and allied support for Ukraine would not disappear.  ""The United States has now committed more than $13.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration,"" said Defense Under Secretary Colin Kahl.  ""At least as we can discern, Vladimir Putin has not given up on his overall strategic objectives of seizing most of Ukraine... His theory of victory is that he can wait everybody out,"" Kahl told reporters.  ""So packages like this are extraordinarily important, in directly challenging Putin's theory of the case, which is that we're not in it for the long haul, that we aren't supporting Ukraine for the long haul,"" he said.    - Himars still crucial -    The $3 billion will cover six National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) and their munitions, 310,000 artillery rounds, up to 24 counter-artillery radars, Puma surveillance drones and a new system dubbed Vampire that uses small missiles to shoot down enemy drones.  It was unveiled just five days after the Pentagon announced a $775 million package of arms, including precision guided missile systems, to be delivered in the coming weeks.   The new support comes as both sides remain locked in a heavily artillery-driven fight along a long front line in eastern and southern Ukraine, with neither military force making significant gains in recent weeks.  But the US supply of 16 Himars precision-guided missile systems since June have given Ukrainian forces the ability to target dozens of command posts and ammunition depots far behind the Russian lines, stifling the Russian Military's earlier momentum.  The Himars systems are ""the most relevant munitions for the current fight,"" Kahl told reporters.    - Six months of war -    Biden hailed Ukraine's resistance against the invasion, which Putin launched on February 24 after years of unsuccessfully trying to reassert Russian control over the westward-looking country that has pushed strongly for membership in NATO and the European Union.  Thousands of soldiers on both sides and thousands of civilians have died in the largest-scale battles seen in Europe since World War II.   Despite Russian expectations of a quick victory, Ukrainian armed forces have pushed the invaders back to a swath of territory in the country's east and south.  ""Six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians' pride in themselves, in their country, and in their thirty-one years of independence,"" Biden said.

United, Korean Air and Japan's two main airlines confirmed they had already suspended operations of 62 planes fitted with the same family of engine which scattered debris over Denver on Saturday.  The US National Transportation and Safety Board is also investigating the incident, in which no one was hurt.   Boeing warned similarly fitted planes should be taken out of service until the Federal Aviation Authority had determined an inspection procedure.   ""While the NTSB investigation is ongoing, we recommended suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines,"" the company said.   Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) said they had respectively grounded 13 and 19 planes using PW4000 engines but had avoided flight cancelations by using other aircraft.  The Japanese transport ministry said it had ordered stricter inspections of the engine after a JAL 777 plane flying from Haneda to Naha experienced trouble with ""an engine in the same family"" in December.  United said it had voluntarily removed 24 Boeing 777 planes from service and expected ""only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.""  South Korea's transport ministry said it had no immediate plans to ground planes, adding it was monitoring the situation.  But Korean Air, the country's largest airline and flag carrier, said it had grounded all six of its Boeing 777s with PW4000 engines currently in operation.  ""We have decided to ground all our PW 4000 powered 777s, and we expect the FAA's updated protocol soon,"" the company told AFP in an emailed statement.  The FAA earlier ordered extra inspections of some passenger jets.   Steve Dickson, the head of the regulator, said he had consulted with experts and that some airplanes would ""likely"" be removed from service.  ""I have directed them to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines,"" he said in a statement.  Dickson added that a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades, which were unique to the engine model and only used on 777 planes.   Officials from the FAA were meeting with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives on Sunday evening, he added.    - Fresh blow for Boeing -    Flight UA328 had been headed from Denver to Honolulu when it experienced an engine failure shortly after departure.   Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community.  No one onboard or on the ground was injured.   But the engine failure marks a fresh blow for Boeing after several high-profile aviation accidents.  The manufacturer's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after 346 people died in two crashes -- the 2019 Lion Air disaster in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash the following year.  Investigators said a main cause of both crashes was a faulty flight handling system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.  Boeing was forced to revamp the system and implement new pilot training protocols.  The 737 MAX was a big hit with airlines, becoming Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft until its grounding, which has now been lifted.   After the Covid-19 crisis decimated demand, airlines canceled hundreds of orders for the plane.  wat-to/oho/gle   BOEING    JAPAN AIRLINES    ANA HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab group stormed the popular Hayat Hotel on Friday evening in a hail of gunfire and bomb blasts.  Sporadic gunfire and loud explosions could still be heard early Saturday, many hours after the start of the assault.  It is the biggest attack in Mogadishu since Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was elected in May after many months of political instability.  The jihadist group, which has been waging a deadly insurgency against Somalia's fragile central government for about 15 years, claimed responsibility.  ""The security forces continued to neutralise terrorists who have been cordoned inside a room in the hotel building; most of the people were rescued but at least eight civilians were confirmed dead so far,"" security commander Mohamed Abdikadir told AFP.  ""The security forces rescued dozens of civilians including children who were trapped in the building safely,"" he added.  Dozens of people have been gathering outside the hotel to discover the fate of loved ones caught up inside the hotel.  ""We have been looking for a relative of mine who was trapped inside the hotel, she was confirmed dead together with six other people, two of them I know,"" said witness Muudey Ali.  Witnesses reported at least two large explosions as the gunmen stormed the hotel, a popular spot frequented by government officials and ordinary Somalis.  Police spokesman Abdifatah Adan Hassan had told reporters late Friday that the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who attacked the hotel with several other gunmen.  Witnesses said a second blast occurred just a few minutes later, inflicting casualties on rescuers and members of the security forces and civilians who rushed to the scene after the first explosion.    - 'Random shooting' -    The militants claimed responsibility for the attack in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website.  ""A group of Al-Shabaab attackers forcibly entered Hotel Hayat in Mogadishu, the fighters are carrying out random shooting inside the hotel,"" the group said.  Earlier this week, the United States announced that its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab fighters in an air strike in the central-southern part of the country as the Islamist militants were attacking Somali forces.  The US has carried out several air raids on the militants in recent weeks.  In May, President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia to help local authorities combat Al-Shabaab, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump to withdraw most US forces.  In recent weeks, Al-Shabaab fighters have also launched attacks on the Somalia-Ethiopia border, raising concerns about a possible new strategy by the jihadists.  Somalia's new president Mohamud said last month that ending Al-Shabaab's insurgency required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Al-Shabaab fighters were driven out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force, but the group still controls swathes of countryside.  It continues to launch deadly strikes on civilian and military targets, with popular hotels and restaurants frequently hit.  Earlier this month, new Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre announced the appointment of the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow, 53, publicly defected from Al-Shabaab in August 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5 million bounty for his capture.  The Horn of Africa nation has been mired in chaos since the fall of the military regime of President Siad Barre in 1991.  His ouster was followed by a civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.  The deadliest attack in Somalia occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in a bustling commercial district of Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  nur/txw/smw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Authorities have yet to say why the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 went into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport on Saturday afternoon.  But, on Sunday, they said that they had pinpointed the location of its black boxes -- cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- that could be key to explaining why the plane slammed into the Java Sea off the sprawling city's coast.  The search and rescue agency said it had collected body bags filled with human remains, as well as debris from the wreckage, in waters about 23 metres (75 feet) deep.  Passengers Ihsan Adhlan Hakim and his new bride Putri were headed to Pontianak, the city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island which had been flight SJ182's destination, about 90 minutes away.  ""He called me to say that the flight was delayed due to bad weather,"" Hakim's brother Arwin said from Pontianak, where a wedding celebration had been planned for the newlyweds.  ""That was the last time I had contact with him.""    - Steep dive -    Beben Sofian, 59, and her husband Dan Razanah, 58 were also on the doomed flight.  ""They took a selfie and sent it to their kids before taking off,"" the couple's nephew, Hendra, told AFP.  DNA from relatives will be compared with discovered remains for identification.  All 62 passengers and crew aboard the half-full flight were Indonesian. The count included 10 children.  Distraught relatives waited nervously for news at Pontianak airport.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" said a sobbing Yaman Zai.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  Data from FlightRadar24 indicated that the airliner reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  The transport minister said Saturday that the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  ""The aircraft's final moments are... very concerning as the speed that (it) was flying at that altitude was much lower than expected,"" said Stephen Wright, professor of aircraft systems at Finland's Tampere University.  ""The last seconds saw the aircraft rapidly descend from 10,000 feet to the sea in a matter of 20 seconds, which implies a catastrophic event or something deliberate.""  But he added that the crash can ""only be fully explained once the black boxes and wreckage can be properly analysed"".  Sriwijaya Air, which operates flights to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said little so far about the 26-year-old plane, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.  The Indonesian carrier has not recorded a fatal crash since it started operations in 2003, but this accident is the latest in a string of disasters for the country's aviation sector.  The Southeast Asia nation's aviation sector has long been marred by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.    - Safety concerns -    In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.  That accident -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the accidents.  The 737 that went down Saturday was not a MAX variant.  ""Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families,"" Boeing said in a statement.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.  A final report said major factors included a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance, and the pilots' inadequate response.  A year later more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/fox   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

Final results were still expected, but provisional counts showed the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) was set to extend its stranglehold on power in the oil-rich southern African country, giving its leader President Joao Lourenco a second term in office.  ""According to preliminary results, we have a comfortable majority,"" MPLA spokesman Rui Falcao told journalists at the party's headquarters in Luanda.  With 97 percent of ballots tallied, Angola's electoral commission late Thursday said the MPLA had scored 51.07 percent of the vote.   The main opposition party -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Adalberto Costa Junior -- had secured 44.05 percent, a huge jump from 26.67 percent in the 2017 election.  Alex Vines, of the UK-based think tank Chatham House, said it was likely Costa Junior's party would object to the final count.  ""We can expect... some months of political turbulence as UNITA will challenge the results,"" he said.  Anastacio Ruben Sicato, a senior member of the opposition party, said the official results did not tally with their own count.  ""We hope there can be common sense,"" he said.  But, he added, ""we are not encouraging a rebellion, the process is not over, we must remain calm"".   The MPLA has traditionally wielded control over the electoral process and state media, and opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering.  The party has ruled Angola for 47 years since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975.   But it has seen a steady decline in support in recent elections.  While it romped to victory with 71.84 percent of votes in 2012, it only garnered 61 percent five years after that.    - 'New era' -    Augusto Santana, of the non-profit Democracy Works Foundation, predicted protests over the weekend.   ""UNITA is not happy because they think they have won the elections,"" he said.  The latest election has been overshadowed by a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought.  The opposition has proved popular in urban areas, winning in the capital Luanda and among youth disaffected with the ruling party.  Gilson Leopoldo, a 26-year-old accountant in Luanda, said young Angolans now had more access to information.  ""The people have voted en masse for UNITA, and to end the vicious circle of corruption that plagues the country,"" he said.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza has also nurtured corruption and nepotism.  Santana said that, even though the opposition was unlikely to manage to overturn the results, Wednesday's vote could still usher in a ""new era of politics"".  The MPLA looked set to retain a majority in parliament, he said, but would face more pushback from a larger number of UNITA lawmakers.  This ""will motivate more dialogue"", he said.  Marisa Lourenco, an independent analyst based in Johannesburg, said times were changing as voters ""no longer believe in the ruling party's ability or will to change their socioeconomic prospects"".  ""This is the last election the MPLA will win outright,"" she said.  str-ub/giv/sn/ah","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

""BFI is a Cuban military-controlled commercial bank that benefits directly from financial transactions at the expense of the Cuban people"" while giving ""preferential access"" to military and state companies, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement.  The move comes amid recent speculation that the Trump administration, in its waning days, is weighing whether to redesignate the island as a state sponsor of terrorism.  Such a move, which would severely impede foreign investment, could hinder the diplomacy of President-elect Joe Biden.  The State Department has drawn up a proposal to that effect, according to the New York Times, which said it was unclear if Pompeo would sign off on it.   The speculation drew a sharp denunciation from Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, who repeated a frequent complaint that the US itself shelters ""terrorist groups acting against Cuba.""  Cuban-American anti-communist activists deny any wrongdoing.  US Representative Gregory Meeks, the incoming chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has warned Pompeo against making the terrorism designation.

The 350-kilometre (217-mile) rail network was expected to cut travel time between Singapore and the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur to 90 minutes from the four or more hours by car today.  Singapore and Malaysia signed a deal to build the bullet train line in 2016, but its fate was thrown into doubt after the election of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad two years later.   Mahathir said he wanted to scrap the project as part of an effort to review major infrastructure projects approved by his scandal-tainted predecessor in a bid to cut the country's debt.   Construction was then suspended for two years at Malaysia's request, with plans to commence service in 2031.   The project was terminated after a final deadline on December 31, and after both governments failed to reach an agreement over changes proposed by Malaysia.

Unrest began the day after the October 4 vote, as losing parties took to the streets to decry large-scale vote-buying campaigns that benefited parties close to then-president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.  By night-time the protests had morphed into clashes with police, with one protester killed as several prominent politicians, including ex-leader Almazbek Atambayev and populist Japarov, were freed from jail.  The days that followed saw politicians jostle to fill a power vacuum, with Japarov's supporters the largest of the groups insisting on Jeenbekov's immediate resignation despite authorities cancelling the vote results.  Kyrgyzstan is no stranger to volatility, with revolutions unseating successive presidents in 2005 and 2010.  But the sudden nature of the crisis appeared to take even key ally Russia by surprise.  President Vladimir Putin's Deputy Chief of Staff Dimitry Kozak flew to Bishkek to meet with both Jeenbekov and Japarov.   While the visit was seen as bolstering Jeenbekov's position, he resigned just days later, citing the need to avoid bloodshed as a crowd backing Japarov gathered close to his official residence.  Japarov acted as head of state until November, when he stepped down from the post to run in Sunday's presidential vote.    - A referendum as well -    In his first televised address to the nation on October 16, the new acting leader pledged ""a real fight against corruption"" and said that organised crime ""will stop dictating its terms"".  He repeated the promise after election results came in Sunday, saying ""we won't repeat the mistakes of previous governments"".  But Japarov's critics fear his main aim is to concentrate power in the style of the strongmen who rule in neighbouring post-Soviet countries Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.   In a parallel referendum Sunday, Kyrgyz voters backed a presidential form of government championed by Japarov that would offer the leader sweeping powers, rejecting competing plans for parliamentary rule.  While work on the new constitution will continue after the vote, with a second referendum promised before June, it seems likely the new basic law will allow repeat terms for sitting presidents, which was banned in 2010 to curb authoritarianism.  Japarov quit his executive roles in November after seeing loyal allies installed in key positions and a potential electoral rival -- former premier Omurbek Babanov -- rule himself out of the contest.  Throughout the campaign, the favourite packed stadiums in campaign rallies across the country, basking in the glow of fawning crowds while failing to attend any of the televised debates between candidates.  During one theatrical appearance in his home region of Issyk-Kul, Japarov was ""blessed"" by seven male elders sporting extravagant national garb.  Earlier this week he took to Facebook to criticise small demonstrations against the referendum in the capital Bishkek.  ""From now on, we must learn to reckon with the people,"" Japarov wrote.

The comments from the incoming administration reflect an unusual area of common ground with outgoing President Donald Trump, who over the past four years unleashed an aggressive and costly trade war that imposed billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on Chinese goods.  Janet Yellen, Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, and Antony Blinken, who was tapped to lead the State Department, nonetheless emphasized areas of difference, particularly the incoming administration's commitments to working with US allies and promoting investments to make American firms and workers more competitive against Beijing.  Responding to questions from the Senate Finance Committee at her confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Yellen called China ""our most important strategic competitor.""  She accused Beijing of ""undercutting American companies"" by offering illegal subsidies, dumping products at below-market prices, stealing intellectual property and erecting barriers to US exports.  ""We need to take on China's abusive unfair and illegal practices,"" she said, adding ""we're prepared to use the full array of tools"" to address those issues.  Speaking the day before Biden is due to take office, she also vowed to be watchful of the national security implications of China's theft of ""trade secrets"" and ""illegal efforts to acquire critical technology.""  Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ""President Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China,"" but added, ""I disagree very much with the way he went about it in a number of areas.""    - Investing in America -    Unlike Trump, who pulled back from multilateral organizations and attacked the trade policies of US partners and adversaries alike, Yellen stressed that it will be important ""to work with our allies"" to combat the challenge posed by China.  Democrats have for years complained bitterly about the exodus of jobs and manufacturing to the Asian country. Trump, a Republican, doubled down on those complaints and won the support of many workers.  In a farewell address Tuesday, the outgoing president defended his record, saying he had brought unprecedented international pressure on Washington's communist rival.  ""We revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before,"" Trump said, according to excerpts released by the White House.  But he in fact consistently acted unilaterally, while both retreating from and crippling the World Trade Organization, which enforces global commerce rules.  Biden, a Democrat, also has pledged to defend American workers and manufacturing, and under his slogan ""Build Back Better"" is expected to soon propose a stimulus plan that includes massive infrastructure investments.  Yellen said that policy would help fend off Beijing's economic challenge.  Washington needs to ""make investments that allow us to compete with China... by investing in our infrastructure, investing in our people and creating a more competitive economy,"" she said.    - Currency manipulation -    Trump, like other administrations before him, also accused China of keeping its currency artificially low as a way to make its products cheaper and gain a trade advantage, and Yellen underscored Washington's opposition to that practice.  The US dollar's value against other currencies ""should be determined by markets,"" Yellen said, while also promising ""to oppose any and all attempts by foreign countries to artificially manipulate currency values to gain an unfair advantage in trade.""

The blaze, blamed on an electrical fault, hit the Abu Sifin church in densely populated Imbaba west of the Nile river, part of Giza governorate.   Witnesses described panicked scenes as people rushed into the multi-storey house of worship to rescue those trapped but were soon overwhelmed by the heat and deadly smoke.   ""Everyone was carrying kids out of the building,"" said Ahmed Reda Baioumy, who lives next to the church. ""But the fire was getting bigger and you could only go in once or you would asphyxiate.""  The Egyptian Coptic Church and the health ministry reported 41 dead and 14 injured in the blaze before emergency services said they had brought the blaze under control.  President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi declared on his Facebook page in the morning: ""I have mobilised all state services to ensure that all measures are taken.""   He later said he had ""presented his condolences by phone"" to Pope Tawadros II, who has been the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church since 2012.  The Giza governor ordered ""urgent aid of 50,000 pounds (around $2,600) for the families of the deceased and 10,000 pounds for the injured"".  The grand imam of Al-Azhar, Egypt's foremost Muslim institution, expressed his condolences for ""the tragic accident"" and affirmed ""the readiness of Al-Azhar hospitals to receive the injured"".    - Power surge -    The interior ministry said ""forensic evidence revealed that the blaze broke out in an air-conditioning unit on the second floor of the church building"" which also houses social services.  Father Farid Fahmy, of another nearby church in Imbaba, told AFP the fire was caused by a short circuit.  ""The power was out and they were using a generator,"" he said. ""When the power came back, it caused an overload.""  Accidental fires are not uncommon in the sprawling megalopolis of Cairo, where millions live in informal settlements.   Baioumy, the neighbour, told AFP that fire-fighters were hampered by the fact the church is located ""on a very narrow street"" where buildings stand barely a few metres apart and fire engines can barely manoeuvre.  Egypt, with its often dilapidated and poorly maintained infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.  In March 2021, at least 20 people died in a blaze in a textile factory in an eastern suburb of Cairo.   In 2020, two hospital fires claimed the lives of 14 Covid-19 patients.  Last Monday a church caught fire in the eastern Cairo district of Heliopolis, though no deaths or injuries were reported.    - Religious minority -    Copts are the largest Christian community in the Middle East, making up at least 10 million of Egypt's 103 million people.  The minority has suffered attacks and complained of discrimination in the majority Muslim north African country, the Arab world's most populous.  Copts have been targeted in deadly attacks by Islamist militants, particularly after Sisi overthrew former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, with churches, schools and homes burnt down.   Members of the minority also complain they have been left out of key state positions and they have deplored restrictive legislation for the construction and renovation of churches compared to that of mosques.   Sisi, the first Egyptian president to attend the Coptic Christmas mass every year, recently appointed the first ever Coptic judge to head the Supreme Constitutional Court, the country's highest.  sar/sbh/bha/fz/jsa   Meta",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113514635']

Hospitals were overrun with hundreds of injured after the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Friday, triggering panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  Rescuers have spent days hauling corpses from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province, where a hospital was flattened and a shopping mall lay in ruins.  Others were killed south of the city.  The official death toll stood at 56 -- up from 46 on Saturday -- but the count could still climb.  Aerial images from the devastated seaside city showed buildings reduced to a tangled mass of twisted metal and chunks of concrete, including the regional governor's office.  It was unclear how many more bodies could be under the debris, or if there was anyone still trapped but alive more than two days after the disaster.  Authorities have not given a figure for how many survivors have been rescued.  A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.  Meanwhile, corpses were recovered from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.    - Running low on food, supplies -    The thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with whole families -- that were lashed by heavy monsoon downpours.  They said they were running low on food, blankets and other aid, as emergency supplies were rushed to the hard-hit region.  Many survivors are unable to return to their destroyed homes, or were too scared to go back fearing a tsunami sparked by aftershocks, which are common after strong earthquakes.  ""It's better to take shelter before something worse happens,"" said Mamuju resident Abdul Wahab, who took refuge in a tent with his wife and four kids, including a baby.  ""We hope the government can deliver aid soon like food, medicine and milk for the children,"" he added.  Worried about an outbreak of Covid-19 in the crowded camps, authorities said they are trying to separate high- and lower-risk groups.  The quake's epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and it had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres.    - Disaster-prone -    In neighbouring Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo island, at least five people had died in heavy flooding while dozens more were missing, according to reports, while floods have killed at least five people in Manado, hundreds of kilometres north of the quake disaster in Sulawesi.  Landslides in West Java killed at least 28 this week as the rainy season heaps misery on parts of the sprawling nation.  At the eastern end of Java island, rumbling Mount Semeru erupted late Saturday, shooting a plume of ash and debris some 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) into the sky, as bright red lava flowed down its crater. There were no immediate reports of casualties.  Disaster-prone Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.  In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  And on December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

The discussions focused on the 25th amendment to the US Constitution, which allows for a president's removal by the vice president and cabinet if he is judged ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.""   Invoking it would require Vice President Michael Pence to lead the cabinet in a vote on removing him.

CBS reporter Margaret Brennan said that ""nothing formal"" had been presented to Pence, and ABC reporter Katherine Faulders said ""multiple"" sources had told her that discussions took place on the unprecedented move.  Trump's encouragement of the protesters, his unfounded claims that he lost the November 3 presidential election due to massive fraud, and other bizarre behavior have raised questions about his ability to lead.  While only two weeks remain before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, after the attacks on Congress Wednesday Democratic lawmakers called for invoking the 25th Amendment as well.  Democrats of the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Pence urging him to act to remove Trump, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and ""sought to undermine our democracy.""

The announcement on the first full day of Biden's presidency is intended to prevent a nuclear arms race but makes clear he will not attempt a ""reset"" of relations as attempted in varying forms by every post-Cold War president.  The treaty, which has limited the United States and Russia to 1,550 nuclear warheads each, expires on February 5 after negotiations stagnated under former president Donald Trump.  Russian President Vladimir Putin himself had offered Trump a five-year extension, the maximum allowed under the treaty that was signed in 2010 in Prague by former president Barack Obama.  ""The United States intends to seek a five-year extension of New START, as the treaty permits,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.  ""This extension makes even more sense when the relationship with Russia is adversarial as it is at this time,"" she said.  She said that the new intelligence chief, Avril Haines, would also start an investigation into Russia's suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was arrested Sunday on his return to Moscow, as well as on Russia's alleged election interference and on whether it was behind the massive SolarWinds hack that shook the US government and corporations.  Psaki said the United States would also investigate bounties reportedly paid by Russian intelligence to extremists in Afghanistan as rewards for killing US troops.  ""Even as we work with Russia to advance US interests, so, too, we work to hold Russia to account for its reckless and adversarial actions,"" Psaki said.  Biden's approach is almost the mirror opposite from that of Trump, who voiced fondness for Putin even as his administration ripped up remaining arms control deals with Russia.   US intelligence concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to back Trump, including through social media manipulation. Psaki said the new probe would assess any role in last year's election.    - Little progress under Trump -    The Trump administration had unsuccessfully tried to widen New START to include its nemesis China, whose nuclear program is quickly growing but is still far smaller than those of Russia and the United States.  With the clock ticking to the expiration, the Trump administration voiced willingness for a one-year extension but talks broke down over US insistence on tougher verification that Russia has frozen its nuclear work.  Marshall Billingslea, who led the negotiations for Trump, immediately denounced Biden's offer, saying it ""shows stunning lack of negotiating skill.""  ""Took just 24 hours for Biden team to squander most significant leverage we have over Russia,"" Billingslea wrote on Twitter.  ""A far better approach would be a short, six-month extension conditioned on finalizing the warhead cap to which Putin agreed.   ""That would stop the massive Russian build-up of 'non-strategic' warheads and also keep the world focused on China. Instead we are getting nothing for extending.""  Several experts as well as anti-nuclear campaigners disputed Billingslea's analysis, saying there were no signs that Russia was going to budge or that China would join.  ""The only opponents are those who seek an unlimited arms race. Glad to see the Biden administration dispensing with reckless games of chicken with global security on Day One,"" tweeted Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategy expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  He said the Biden administration can still find other ways to pressure Russia over its concerns on so-called tactical nuclear weapons -- which Moscow could deploy in hot conflicts close to home, as opposed to strategic weapons that mostly target the United States.  ""This buys the sundae without precluding future sprinkles,"" Narang said.  Derek Johnson, the head of Global Zero, which campaigns for nuclear disarmament, called Biden's proposal a key step in an eventual goal of a world without nuclear weapons.

A spokeswoman for the university in Lerida, which lies 150 kilometres (90 miles) west of Barcelona, confirmed Hasel was at the city centre campus with a group of ""about 20 supporters"", but said the situation was calm and the police were not involved.   Hasel was given until Friday night to turn himself in to begin serving his sentence after being convicted for glorifying terrorism, slander and libel against the crown and state institutions.

Tears rolled down Biden's cheeks at a farewell ceremony in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where he paid tribute to his late son and rising politician Beau, before catching a plane to the capital.  ""Excuse the emotion, but when I die, Delaware will be written on my heart,"" Biden said. ""I only have one regret, that he's not here, because we should be introducing him as president.""  Trump, who has not appeared in public for a week, broke days of silence with a videoed farewell address which the White House said would be released later in the day.  According to excerpts, Trump for the first time asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming Biden administration -- a change of tune from weeks spent persuading his huge number of Republican followers that the Democrat cheated in their election battle.  Trump has yet to personally congratulate Biden on his win or invite him for the customary cup of tea in the Oval Office.  In one of his last acts before he flies to Florida from Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday morning, Trump is expected to issue scores of pardons, with speculation rife over who might make the list.  The latest indications are that Trump will not take the legally dubious step of issuing himself and his children preemptive pardons.  Outside the White House fence, central Washington has taken on a dystopian look ahead of Biden's inauguration, swarming with National Guard troops and largely emptied of ordinary people.  Covid-19 restrictions meant the swearing-in ceremony at noon on Wednesday was always due to be sparsely attended. But fears of right-wing attacks in the wake of the pro-Trump riot in the Capitol building on January 6 have triggered unprecedented deployments of armed soldiers, concrete barriers and secure areas dubbed ""green"" and ""red"" zones.  Adding to the tension, the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.    - Biden comes to town -    Biden, a veteran Democratic senator who also served as vice president to Barack Obama, left for Washington with his wife Jill Biden.  Together with incoming vice president Kamala Harris -- the first woman ever to hold the job -- Biden was due to deliver a Tuesday evening address on the Covid-19 crisis, from the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool.  This will give the incoming president and vice president a first glimpse of a city transformed for their inauguration.  The grassy Mall area, barred to the public, has been filled with some 200,000 American flags to represent the people who at any other inauguration would have come to witness history. Fifty six pillars of light will beam up to represent the 50 US states and territories.  Another eye-catching number is the more than 20,000 National Guards troops on duty, many of them carrying automatic rifles and dressed in full combat gear.  Illustrating the level of worry after the attack by the pro-Trump mob, the defense department said that all Guard troops were being vetted by the FBI and military for possible threats.  Biden is coming in with a strong message of unity, insisting that he can bring a divided country back to the center and confront the nation's multiple crises, starting with Covid-19, together.  The inaugural speech will last between 20-30 minutes, according to a source familiar with preparations, and ""he will reach out to all Americans, and call on every citizen to be part of meeting the extraordinary challenges facing all of us,"" an advisor said, asking to remain unnamed.  To symbolize the new spirit, Biden has invited the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell -- and other top congressional leaders to attend a church service with him on Wednesday before the inauguration.  A person familiar with McConnell's plans confirmed to AFP the Republican congressional leader would join Biden, a longtime Senate colleague, in church.    - Pardons -    For Trump, the main piece of unfinished business is now the expected slew of pardons that he is reported to be preparing.  According to CNN and other US outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he will grant clemency to.  After what The New York Times reports has been an intense lobbying effort, these are expected to be a mix of white-collar criminals and people whose cases have been championed by criminal justice activists.  More controversial possible pardons that have been the subject of speculation for months would be for the likes of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Trump's influential advisor Stephen Bannon.  But Trump has, according to latest US media reports, moved away from the temptation to issue himself a preemptive pardon. This would anger his Republican backers in the Senate right ahead of the start of the impeachment trial.  Although Trump was easily acquitted thanks to party support in his first impeachment last year, this time it may not go so well.  Senior Senate Republican McConnell said in blistering comments Tuesday that Trump had ""provoked"" his supporters and that the ""mob was fed lies"" before embarking on the assault against Congress.  sms/ec",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Prime Minister Petr Fiala said the Czech Republic, which holds the EU presidency, ""will convene an urgent meeting of energy ministers to discuss specific emergency measures"".    - Energy anxiety -    The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been cause for mounting concern since it was seized by Russian troops in the opening weeks of the war.  In recent weeks, Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame for rocket strikes around the facility in the southern Ukrainian city of Energodar.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Thursday the cut-off was caused by Russian shelling of the last active power line linking the plant to the network.   ""Russia has put Ukrainians as well as all Europeans one step away from radiation disaster,"" he said in his nightly address.  Energoatom said the outage was caused by ash pit fires at an adjacent thermal power plant, which damaged a line connecting the only two of the plant's six reactors in operation.  The three other power lines linking the complex to the national grid ""were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks"" by Russian forces, the operator said.  On Friday afternoon Energoatom said one reactor had been reconnected ""and capacity is being added"".  - No time to lose -    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has previously said the situation at the plant is ""highly volatile"" and ""underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"".  ""We can't afford to lose any more time,"" the organisation's Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on Thursday.  ""I'm determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days.""   Ukraine energy minister adviser Lana Zerkal said the inspection ""is planned for the next week, and now we are working on how they will get there"".  But in an interview with Ukraine's Radio NV on Thursday evening, she was sceptical the mission would go ahead, despite Moscow's formal agreement.  ""They are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission will not reach the site,"" she said.  Zelensky has said ""the IAEA and other international organisations should react much quicker"".  Energoatom did not disclose whether there were blackouts as a result of the power cut.  However, the mayor of the city of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov said on Thursday ""Russian occupiers cut off the electricity in almost all occupied settlements of Zaporizhzhia"".    - 'Unacceptable' -    Kyiv suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russian troops in 2014.  But on Thursday, Washington issued a direct warning against any such move.  ""The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.  ""Any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable.""  President Joe Biden, in a telephone conversation with Zelensky, also called for Russia to return full control of the plant and let in nuclear inspectors, the White House said.  Zelensky said he had spoken with Biden and thanked him for the United States' ""unwavering"" support.  Britain's defence ministry has warned that weekend satellite imagery shows an increased presence of Russian troops at the power plant.  Armoured personnel carriers were deployed within 60 metres (200 feet) of one reactor and ""Russian troops were probably attempting to conceal the vehicles by parking them under overhead pipes and gantries"".  ""Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near (the plant) for propaganda purposes,"" the ministry said.  bur-jts/cdw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

As dust settled on the extraordinary scenes of a besieged seat of power, voices were quickly raised to ask why the 2,300-strong US Capitol Police force so easily gave way to protesters, appearing not to try to arrest them.  And the ease with which they breached security barriers to rampage through the Capitol -- terrorizing lawmakers and briefly shutting down Congress -- laid bare a serious security threat two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.  Addressing reporters Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose office was among those vandalized, led calls for Capitol Police chief Steven Sund to resign.  Fellow Democratic Representative Maxine Waters earlier called for an investigation into the security breach, saying she raised concerns at length with Sund days before Wednesday's protests -- called to coincide with the certification by Congress of Biden's win, and intended by Trump to be ""wild.""  Branding the extreme right-wing fringe among Trump's backers as ""terrorists,"" Waters said she had been assured they would not be allowed anywhere near the Capitol.  ""What the hell?""  she tweeted.  But police officials pushed back, saying they lacked intelligence on the plans of the protesters -- who like Trump claim without evidence that the November election was fraudulent.   ""The USCP had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities,"" said Sund, referring to protests protected by the US constitution's guarantee of free speech.  ""But make no mistake -- these mass riots were not First Amendment activities; they were criminal riotous behavior.""    - Nobody called -    The unique structure of policing in Washington, the US capital with broad swathes of federal government properties but also a city unto itself, fed into the disastrous attack on Congress.  The Capitol Police control the area around the Congress, and the city's larger, better-trained force can't go there unless asked.  The siege of the Capitol building was well underway when they were called in at about 1 pm Wednesday, said metropolitan Washington police chief Robert Contee.  ""Things were already pretty bad at that point,"" he told a press conference Thursday.  Contee said that they arrested several armed protesters, found two pipe bombs at Democratic and Republican party offices, and a truck loaded with Molotov cocktails.  The city government also controls local National Guard forces which had been called up to help with the demonstrations.   But Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Capitol never asked for their help.  ""The Capitol Police and the leadership at the Capitol, they did not make the decision to call in guard support. I cannot order the army, National Guard to the United States Capitol grounds.""  The breach was embarrassingly easy and clearly dangerous.   Capitol Police had their weapons drawn at several points but didn't stop the breach. At one point, however, one officer fired his weapon at the demonstrators, hitting and killing a woman.    - Michigan kidnap plot -    Among the crowd of Trump fans were a number of members of the Proud Boys and other armed militia groups known nationwide to be a threat.   Some were from Michigan, where last summer a similar pro-Trump group heavily armed with assault rifles, invaded the Michigan state capitol to protest Covid-19 controls.  In October the FBI arrested 13 in a plot to kidnap and possibly execute Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a critic of Trump.  And the FBI has called right-wing extremists the biggest threat of domestic terrorism.  But over the past year, Trump's government has focused its federal law enforcement efforts on the left-wing Black Lives Matter and Antifa movements, which have been mostly tied to limited crimes of property damage.   Biden pointedly accused authorities Thursday of treating the pro-Trump mob more leniently than anti-racism demonstrators who were forcibly dispersed by police in Washington last year -- calling it ""unacceptable.""  Contee admitted they didn't know what the pro-Trump protesters had planned.  ""There was no intelligence that suggested there would be a breach of the US Capitol,"" he said.  Lawmakers blasted broader government preparedness.  ""It was well known that extremist groups, some of whom desire to foment civil war, were planning violence,"" said Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.  ""Nearly 20 years after 9/11, we still clearly have massive gaps in the Federal government's terrorism preparedness and response capabilities,"" he said.  Bowser meanwhile questioned why the Trump administration brought in thousands of federal law enforcement officials to confront Black Lives Matter protesters in the summer, but had little ready for Wednesday's violence.  She said the city was moving immediately to erect a ""no-scale"" fence in a very broad perimeter around the Capitol, the site of Biden's inauguration on January 20.  She also extended the city-wide state of emergency through that date and called up 6,200 national guard troops from Washington and neighbouring states for that day, far more than normal for an inauguration.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104705419', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104717056']"

Three bodies had been found and a desperate search was underway for more, police said, and efforts are underway to clear villages in the stricken region of Uttarakhand state.

For the town located on the edge of the most important US army base in Europe, hope was revived in November by the election of Democrat Joe Biden as the next US president.  But much remains at stake for the community known as ""Little America"", whose prosperity has depended on the presence of US troops since the end of World War II 75 years ago.  ""Grafenwoehr is nothing without the US soldiers,"" said Piri Bradshaw, whose parents run an Irish pub in the town centre.  Establishments like this have become the life and soul of Grafenwoehr, where traditional barbers stand alongside tattoo parlours -- not to mention the many bars and restaurants that were doing a roaring trade before Covid-19 came along.  On one street corner, a BMW dealership offers a ""military discount"".  ""Imagine, we have seven supermarkets -- far too many for a town of 6,500 inhabitants,"" Bradshaw points out.  But someone has to feed the 40,000 soldiers and their families who live in and around the base.    - Roaring of gunfire -    In the town centre, a few old buildings still bear witness to Grafenwoehr's distant past as a quiet rural community -- but the roaring of gunfire quickly brings visitors back to the present.  ""We are used to it and sometimes don't even hear it anymore,"" said Birgit Ploessner, head of culture at the Military Museum, pointing out that a training camp was set up here as early as 1908.  The US set up a permanent base near the town after the defeat of the Nazis, but the country's overall military presence in Germany has declined from some 200,000 soldiers in 1990 to 34,500 today.  Although the prospect had been looming for years, President Donald Trump's decision in July to redeploy 12,000 soldiers from Germany -- including some 5,000 from Grafenwoehr and the neighbouring town of Vilseck -- still came as a shock.  Even a small reduction in troops would have ""serious"" economic consequences for the town, according to Grafenwoehr mayor Edgar Knobloch.  ""The base provides employment for more than 3,000 civilians in the region,"" he told AFP.   In addition, the troops spend about 660 million euros a year in the local community.  The election of Biden and the suspension of troop withdrawals pending further analysis by the Pentagon has been a great ""relief"" for the town, Knobloch said.   ""Our troubles are not over, but I am confident that the decision will be in our favour,"" he said.  Knobloch believes such a decision would also be in the interests of the US, which has invested heavily in recent years to modernise the base.  Soldiers are trained at Grafenwoehr before being sent on missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the armies of NATO member countries also train there regularly.    - Plastic Elvis -     And the base does not only have economic value. ""Three generations of US soldiers have followed one another here, sometimes even from father to son,"" said Ploessner.  They include the King himself, Elvis Presley, who did most of his military service in Germany.   During his time in Grafenwoehr, Presley even gave a private concert in a bar -- the only one in Europe in his entire career.   The town museum has lovingly recreated the scene with the original piano and a plastic Elvis.  The presence of the US soldiers permeates every aspect of cultural and social life in the town.  ""We celebrate US Independence Day like the Maibaum,"" Ploessner said, referring to a popular Celtic Maypole festival in Bavaria.  ""There is a real understanding between people here,"" adds Knobloch, with some soldiers even returning to settle in the area after they leave the army.  Raymond Tavarez Gascot is one of them. A year after retiring from the army, the Puerto Rico-born former paratrooper returned to Grafenwoehr in 2007, got married and fulfilled his dream of setting up a garage.  ""I fell in love with the country, the culture,"" said the 45-year-old, though he admits to still struggling with the language.  ""Yes I miss the weather, the beach, the sun,"" he said. But ""the reality is you can't compare the quality of life"".  ilp-fec/mfp/pvh   CELTIC PLC    BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26773028', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96145859']"

Polls point to a first-round victory for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator turned approachable head of state known for candid moments like queueing at the supermarket in shorts, plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized or sharing a meal with homeless people.  But observers have their eye on how a far-right challenger will perform, as well as whether a lockdown-induced plunge in turnout could produce an upset.  Turnout reached 35.4 percent by 1600 GMT, only slightly lower than at the same time five years ago and soothing fears that abstentions might top 70 percent.  Voters queued outside polling stations in the capital Lisbon, being let in one by one under social distancing rules.  ""To those who can and who want to vote, overcome your fears"", Rebelo de Sousa said after casting his ballot in Celorico de Basto, his stronghold in the northern region of Minho.  Arriving at a Lisbon school to cast his vote, Luis Araujo told AFP that ""even if it's important to come and vote, there's not much sense coming out and gathering with thousands of people while we're locked down"".    - National lockdown -    Another voter, architect Jose Barra, 54, told AFP: ""Nothing would have stopped me from voting, but I think elderly people, for example, will be discouraged both by the virus and by the queues.""  As mail-in ballots are not well-established in Portugal, early voting was available last Sunday, drawing nearly 200,000 voters, though long lines may have defeated the purpose in some areas.  Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at braking a surge in coronavirus cases.  The country recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll on Sunday, bringing fatalities to almost 10,500.  More than 85,000 infections and almost 1,500 deaths were reported in the past week, the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its population of more than 10 million, according to an AFP tally based on government figures.  Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants.    - Keep it to one round -    At stake in the election is a post with the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power.  In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa -- often referred to simply by his first name -- urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round.  That would ""spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks"" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said.  ""An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable,"" the 72-year-old warned.  Low turnout could also upset the expected easy win for Rebelo de Sousa, with polls giving him 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of socialist challenger Ana Gomes and far-right populist Andre Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent.  A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way.    - Far-right challenge -    Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government.  He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist.  Meanwhile Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- ""Enough"" -- says he is in the running to ""crush the Left"", which is fielding three out of the seven candidates.  Portugal has so far to a large degree not seen the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years.  Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.

The vote in the wealthy northeastern region could see a high level of abstentions as Spain battles a third wave of coronavirus infections.  Some 5.5 million people are eligible to vote, but polls have suggested a turnout of just 60 percent, compared to roughly 80 percent during the last regional election in December 2017.  To decrease the risk of contagion, regional authorities set up polling station in spacious venues such as around FC Barcelona's football stadium and the bullring in the port city of Tarragona.  ""It's obvious that it's not the best moment to hold an election,"" Sergi Lopes, 40, told AFP at a polling station in Barcelona.  ""But when you take the metro to go to work every day, you are also being exposed.""  The regional government tried to postpone the elections until the end of May because of the surge in coronavirus infections but the courts blocked that move.  Polls opened at 9:00 am (0800 GMT) and will close at 8:00 pm (1900 GMT), with results expected at around midnight.  The final hour of voting will be reserved for people infected with Covid-19 or undergoing quarantine. During this time polling staff will wear gloves, facial screens and protective gowns.    - Three-way race -    While more than 40 percent of the 82,000 people assigned to help staff polling stations on the day had asked to be recused, all polling stations were operating normally as of noon, said the Catalan government.  Voters entered one by one to avoid crowding, forcing people to stand in lines outside under intermittent rain.  ""They will say there is a lot of abstention. It's raining, there are queues, we are getting wet... it's not well organised,"" said Josep Maria Prats, a 59-year-old health worker as he waitied to vote in Barcelona.  The drop in turnout adds to the uncertainty of the outcome.  Polls put the Socialists who govern at the national level neck-and-neck with the two pro-independence parties which have governed Catalonia together for the past five years.  Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is hoping this election, the fifth in a decade, could end their rule.  He took part in several rallies to support the Socialists' top candidate, former health minister Salvador Illa who gained a high-profile for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.  But even if Illa's Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) comes out on top, polls suggest separatist parties together could once again cobble together a ruling majority, despite deep dividions since the failed 2017 independence bid.    - Separatist battle -    This would be a repeat of the last election in December 2017 when the stridently pro-unity Ciudadanos won the most seats but was unable to form a government.  The main question then is which of Catalonia's two main separatist parties will come out stronger -- the hardline JxC -- ""Together for Catalonia"" -- or the more moderate ERC.  In the previous election in December 2017, JxC was ahead, forming a 70-seat coalition with ERC.  Should the tables be turned in ERC's favour, it would likely ease tensions and help the tentative reconciliation Sanchez's government has sought to broker since coming to power.   Sanchez came to lead Spain's government in 2018 thanks in part to support from Catalan separatists. Even today, his minority government relies on them to pass legislation.  ""An ERC executive would maintain the current ambiguous approach of criticising Madrid rhetorically but not adopting any unilateral measures,"" said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at political consultancy Teneo.  ""In contrast, a government headed by JxC would probably lead to a more confrontational stance.""  dbh/ds/jj",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48838589']

Results published by the country's electoral commission gave the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) 51.07 percent of the vote with more than 97 percent of ballots tallied.   This is significantly lower than its previous performance where it garnered 61 percent.  The main opposition group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Adalberto Costa Junior, stood at 44.05 percent -- a huge jump from 26.67 percent in the 2017 election.  The leader of the winning party automatically ascends to the presidency in the oil-rich former Portuguese colony.   A senior member of the opposition party and former rebel movement told a news conference that the official results did not tally with their own parallel count.  ""We hope there can be common sense, we are not encouraging a rebellion, the process is not over, we must remain calm,"" said Anastacio Ruben Sicato.  The ruling party has seen a steady decline in support in recent peacetime elections. In 2012 it romped to victory with 71.84 percent against UNITA's 18.66 percent. In 2008, MPLA won with 81.64 percent.  Its parliamentary share of seats dropped to 124 from 150 in the last election, while UNITA's nearly doubled to 90 from 51 of the 220 parliamentary seats up for grabs.    - 'Always the same story' -    The MPLA has ruled Angola for nearly 50 years since the country gained independence in 1975, before a civil war erupted, lasting 27 years and claiming at least 500,000 lives.  Multi-party elections in Angola were introduced in 1992.  But the MPLA's Jose Eduardo dos Santos, first elected in 1979, remained in office until 2017, when Lourenco succeeded him for a first five-year term.  The latest election has been overshadowed by a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought, compounded by dos Santos' death last month in Spain.  ""MPLA leads the count,"" read state newspaper Jornal de Angola's front page on Thursday.  Residents in the oceanside capital Luanda reacted with mixed feelings to the preliminary results.  ""I voted for UNITA, and I do not believe in these results,"" said Jorge, a 40-year-old mechanic who did not give his surname, accusing the electoral commission of being in cahoots with the ruling party.  ""The country is not going to change, it's always the same story.""  Lourenco, a 68-year-old former general educated in the Soviet Union, is credited with far-reaching reforms since taking power.  These include boosting financial transparency and efficiency, fighting sweeping nepotism and corruption, and promoting business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors.  Critics say his anti-graft crusade is one-sided and aimed at settling political scores, targeting children and cronies of his predecessor.    - Fears of tampering -    But his party supporters exude pride in the formerly Soviet-backed party.  ""I am happy, the MPLA has given young people opportunities, there is more work and transparency,"" said 27-year-old shopkeeper Madalena Antonio, commenting on the early results.   ""The government did what it could do. Things will get better.""  The MPLA has traditionally wielded control over the electoral process, and state media and opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering.  Results in past elections, including 2017, have been contested -- a process that can take several weeks.  UNITA's deputy leader Abel Chivukuvuku said earlier that the party's own tally showed it was ahead.  There is a ""clear provisional indication of a winning trend for UNITA in all provinces,"" he told a live streamed press conference late Wednesday.  More than 14 million people were registered to vote.  A team of observers from the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) declared the election to have been organised in ""accordance with international requirements"" and Angolan laws.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza also nurtured corruption and nepotism under dos Santos.  Dos Santos will be buried on Sunday, which would have been his 80th birthday.  clt-ub-sn/giv/cdw   TOTALENERGIES","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

""The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the (plant) from the power grid -- the first in the history of the plant,"" Energoatom says on the Telegram messaging app.  Europe's largest nuclear plant has been the target of military strikes, which each side blames on the other.  The attacks have raised fears of a nuclear disaster on the scale of that in Ukraine's Chernobyl in 1986.  Kyiv officials have said they believe Moscow has seized the station in southern Ukraine to divert power to the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.    - Deadly railway station strike -    Russia says it killed over 200 Ukrainian troops in an attack on a railway station in central Ukraine that Kyiv said left 25 people dead, including children.  ""As a result of a direct hit by an Iskander missile on a military train at the Chaplyne railway station in the Dnipropetrovsk region, more than 200 servicemen of the reserve of Ukraine's Armed Forces and 10 units of military equipment were destroyed,"" Russia's defence ministry says in its daily briefing.   Ukraine's railways have been vital in the effort to evacuate vast swathes of the country since Moscow sent in troops.  The defence ministry says the train was ""en route to combat zones"" in the eastern Donbas region, which Moscow seeks to fully control.   The EU has condemned the ""heinous"" attack on civilians carried out on Wednesday, the day Ukraine marked Independence Day and six months since the start of Moscow's invasion.    - Putin raises army headcount -    Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a decree to increase the headcount of the country's army.    Russia's army will have over two million people, including 1.15 million servicemen, starting January 2023.   Putin last set the army headcount in 2017, at around 1.9 million people with 1.01 million soldiers.  While the decree does not outline the reasons for the increase, it comes as Moscow's troops are focused on capturing territories in eastern Ukraine.   The decree also comes at a time of soaring tensions between Moscow and Western countries, which have imposed sanctions on Russia.    - Latvia removes Soviet-era monument -    Latvia takes down a Soviet-era monument in Riga following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite protests from the Baltic state's ethnic Russian minority to keep it.   Demolition machinery was used to remove the 79-metre (259-foot) World War II memorial, which has become a rallying point for pro-Kremlin supporters in Latvia.   Like fellow Baltic states Estonia and Lithuania, Latvia is a NATO and EU member which has shown strong support for Ukraine in the conflict with Russia.  Latvia's ethnic Russian community -- which makes up 30 percent of the population -- had protested against the removal of the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders.   Riga's parliament has voted to remove all remaining Soviet statues and plaques by mid-November.  burs-jmy/lcm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Adopted in 1967, the 25th Amendment lays out the provisions for a transfer of power from a US president who dies, resigns, is removed from office or for other reasons is unable to fulfill his or her duties.  It has been invoked on several occasions, notably by Richard Nixon when he resigned in 1974 and for presidents undergoing a surgical procedure so that power could be shifted temporarily to the vice president.  In October of last year, there was talk of Trump possibly invoking the amendment when he became ill with Covid-19, but in the end he took no such action.  Now, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are leading appeals for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the amendment in the waning days of Trump's term, which ends January 20.  Schumer, Pelosi and others in and out of government are speaking out after Wednesday's shocking scenes in which an angry mob egged on by Trump overran security at the US Capitol, rampaging for hours and disrupting a proceeding in which Congress ultimately certified that Joe Biden beat Trump in the November 3 election and will be America's next president.   US lawmakers began to address the question of power transfer from the chief executive in the late 1950s amid the ill health of president Dwight D. Eisenhower.  It took on added urgency following the 1963 assassination of president John F. Kennedy, and the 25th Amendment was passed by Congress in 1965 and ratified by the required three-fourths of the 50 US states two years later.  Section 3 of the 25th Amendment addresses the transfer of presidential powers to the vice president when the chief executive declares that he or she is unable to fulfill the powers and duties of the office.  Section 4 addresses a situation in which the vice president and a majority of the cabinet determine that the president is no longer able to discharge their duties. This section has never been invoked.    - Invoked on three occasions -    Section 3 has been invoked three times.  The first was in July 1985 when president Ronald Reagan underwent surgery under general anesthesia for removal of a cancerous polyp from his large intestine.  Vice president George H.W. Bush was made acting president for about eight hours while Reagan was in surgery.   President George W. Bush temporarily transferred power to vice president Dick Cheney in June 2002 and in July 2007 while he underwent routine colonoscopies under anesthesia.  Following Reagan's serious wounding in a 1981 assassination attempt, a letter invoking Section 3 was drafted but it was never sent.  Under Section 3, the president informs the president pro tempore, or presiding officer, of the Senate -- currently Republican Chuck Grassley -- and the speaker of the House of Representatives, currently Pelosi -- in writing that he is unable to discharge the duties of the office and is temporarily transferring power to the vice president.  Under Section 4, the vice president and a majority of the members of the cabinet inform the leaders of the Senate and House that the president is incapable of discharging his duties and the vice president becomes acting president.  If a president contests the determination that he or she is unable to fulfill their duties, it is up to Congress to make the decision.  A two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate would be needed to declare the president unfit to remain in office.  Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe has claimed that former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein raised the possibility of invoking Section 4 against Trump after he abruptly fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017.  Rosenstein has denied the allegation.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104705419']

The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport in Jakarta on Saturday afternoon.  A military vessel ""has found the signal from (Sriwijaya Air) SJ182"" and divers had recovered parts of the plane from around 23 metres (75 feet) below the water's surface, the transport ministry said Sunday, citing Indonesia's military chief Hadi Tjahjanto.  The ministry did not specify if the signal was from the downed plane's black box.  The frantic search appeared to offer no hope of finding any survivors.  ""Several body parts have been found and they've been taken to the police hospital for identification,"" Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told AFP.  ""We don't know yet whether they're from one person. Belongings that we think are from the passengers were also found.""  A child's pink trousers, a broken tyre and wheel, life jackets and suspected wreckage from the plane were also found, according to authorities and AFP reporters on the scene.    - 'Torn into pieces' -    Flight SJ182 was bound for Pontianak city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  On Saturday night, distraught relatives waited nervously for news at Pontianak airport.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" Yaman Zai said as he sobbed.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  The discovery of body parts and wreckage came as a flotilla of warships, helicopters and divers were deployed off the coast of the sprawling capital Sunday.  Sixty-two passengers and crew were aboard the plane, all of them Indonesians, including 10 children, authorities said.  The plane crashed near popular day-trip tourist islands just off the coast, authorities said.  More than 300 personnel from search and rescue, the navy and the police were taking part in the search.  The search-and-rescue agency earlier said poor conditions were hampering the effort, but the military later said visibility had improved and the recovery operation would continue Sunday.  - Sudden dive -    Data from FlightRadar24 indicated that the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  The transport minister said Saturday that the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  Sriwijaya Air, which operates flights to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  It did not immediately comment when contacted by AFP again on Sunday.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  The jet that went down Saturday is not a MAX model and was 26 years old, according to authorities.  ""We are aware of media reports from Jakarta regarding Sriwijaya Air flight SJ-182. Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families,"" Boeing said in a statement.  ""We are in contact with our airline customer and stand ready to support them during this difficult time.""  Indonesia's aviation sector has long had a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.  Domestic investigators' final report on that crash said major factors included a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance, and the pilots' inadequate response.  A year later, in 2015, more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

The 44-year-old Yale-educated anti-corruption campaigner, Putin's best-known opponent, was blocked from challenging Russia's longtime leader in the 2018 presidential election, but he has still managed to be a persistent thorn in the authorities' side.  His call for demonstrations in recent weeks was answered by tens of thousands who rallied in cities spanning the country over two consecutive weekends, demanding Navalny's release from prison and denouncing Putin's rule.  Navalny urged his supporters to protest after being detained in a Moscow airport on arrival from Germany where he was treated for a poisoning attack that he insists was carried out by Russia's security agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB) on Putin's orders.  He returned home in mid-January even though the prison service announced it would seek his arrest on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for embezzlement of three-and-a-half years.  A Moscow court on Tuesday ordered that sentence changed to time in a penal colony, though it said time Navalny previously spent under house arrest in the sentence would count as time served.  His lawyer has said this means he would now serve around two years and eight months in prison, though he also faces additional years of jail time in several other cases.    - Young fan base -    Navalny has won a young fan base through viral videos exposing corruption among the elites and has 2.5 million followers on Twitter.  He has also grabbed attention with his uncompromising rhetoric and coined phrases such as the ""party of crooks and thieves"" to slam the ruling United Russia party.  In 2011, Navalny led mass protests in Moscow over vote-rigging in parliamentary elections.  Two years later the father of two stood for Moscow mayor, coming second against Putin ally Sergei Sobyanin.  In 2017, he accused then-prime minister Dmitry Medvedev of massive corruption in a YouTube documentary, kick-starting a wave of nationwide demonstrations that were met with police violence and large-scale arrests.   The same year he had to travel to Spain for surgery after one of several street attacks left him nearly blind in one eye.  Navalny has faced a series of legal cases which supporters see as punishment for his activism.  In 2014, he was given the suspended sentence for embezzlement, and his brother Oleg, a co-defendant, was jailed for three-and-a-half years in a decision activists likened to a ""hostage-taking"".  Before he flew back from Germany in January, papers were filed with a Moscow court asking for that suspended sentence to be converted into jail time, a move Navalny's allies said was an attempt to block his return.  With the Kremlin tightly controlling the media, Navalny nonetheless remains a fringe figure for many Russians, who are exposed to the official portrayal of him as a Western stooge and convicted criminal.  Putin has refused to pronounce Navalny's name in public.  While barred from mainstream politics, Navalny has sought to expose the wealth of Russia's elites, broadcasting investigations to millions of Russians on social media and YouTube.    - Latest expose -    In his latest expose -- released after his most recent arrest -- he claimed a lavish Black Sea property worth $1.35 billion was built for Putin through a massive corruption scheme.  The report has been viewed more than 107 million times on YouTube and was seen as a driving force behind the latest demonstrations.  But despite tapping into discontent among a largely young urban middle class he is still far from a unifying opposition figure, and some have criticised his anti-immigrant nationalist stance.  He scored political success in local elections in 2019 and 2020, when pro-Putin parties suffered losses because of a ""Smart Voting"" plan Navalny put forward after his allies were barred from standing in numerous races.  The tactic calls for voters to support the one candidate most likely to defeat the ruling party and saw Kremlin-linked candidates drop seats in the Moscow assembly in 2019.  Navalny's offices have been raided repeatedly since, while his Anti-Corruption Foundation was declared a ""foreign agent"" and ordered to pay several large fines.  bur-jbr-emg/mm/pvh/jxb   GOOGLE",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

The country's 13.1 million voters will choose a successor to unpopular socialist President Lenin Moreno and the 137 members of the unicameral congress.  Opinion polls show leftist economist Andres Arauz and conservative Guillermo Lasso the clear frontrunners among 16 candidates, with indigenous rights campaigner Yaku Perez in a distant third place.  The vote takes place as Latin America is battling a second, deadly wave of Covid-19 which has aggravated Ecuador's economic troubles.  ""Today Ecuador wins and democracy wins,"" National Electoral Council president Diana Atamaint said as she declared the start of election day in a ceremony in Quito as polls opened at 7:00 am (1200 GMT).  Voters arrived at polling stations wearing face masks in a nation where the pandemic has claimed 15,000 lives and infected more than 257,000.  Polls suggest many people may stay away for fear of infection.  Front-runners Arauz and Lasso are both predicting victory for their side.  Arauz, 35, represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while businessman Lasso, 65, is from the CREO rightwing movement.  Arauz is a protege of two-time socialist president Rafael Correa, who remains a strong political force in the country despite a graft conviction that sank his hopes of campaigning to become Arauz's deputy.  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year hiatus under Moreno.  He has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.  Running in his third presidential race, free market advocate Lasso has said he would create a million jobs in a year.  He will likely stick to the austerity policies adopted by Moreno, who has had to rein in spending in exchange for International Monetary Fund loans to bolster the oil-producing country's faltering dollar-based economy.    - Second round? -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno as the price of crude crashed.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, is not seeking reelection.  Given the polling numbers, it is unlikely the first presidential round will be decisive.   To emerge victorious, a candidate must take half of the votes cast, plus one, or at least 40 percent with a 10 percentage point advantage over his nearest rival.  A second round is provisionally scheduled for April 11.  Perez, the first indigenous contender in 15 years, is polling at 12 percent. The remaining 12 candidates are all at under four percent, including the only woman on the list -- Ximena Pena.  bur-mlr/mtp/jm","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76763779', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84078919']"

In an unprecedented move police in the capital announced the closure of seven metro stations and said movement of pedestrians would be limited in the city centre.  Moscow authorities also said some centrally-located restaurants and shops will close and overground transport diverted.  Police detained 44-year-old Navalny at a Moscow airport on January 17 as he arrived from Germany, where he had been recovering from exposure to a Soviet-designed nerve toxin.  A makeshift court at a police station ordered the anti-graft campaigner placed in custody until his trial on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.  The Moscow rally is due to take place outside the headquarters of the Federal Security Service, Russia's main security agency, which Navalny says carried out the near-fatal poisoning attack on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.    - 'Wake them up' -    ""The majority is on our side. Let's wake them up,"" Navalny said on Thursday in a message from Moscow's Matrosskaya Tishina, a high-security detention centre.  Tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets of over 100 cities across the country last Saturday to protest Putin's 20-year-rule.  More than 4,000 demonstrators were detained while authorities launched a series of criminal probes.  Authorities are also targeting online platforms demanding they delete posts with calls for rallies or face fines.  The country's media watchdog said Friday it summoned representatives of several social networks, including Facebook and TikTok, for failing to comply.  This week several Navalny associates, including lawyer Lyubov Sobol and his brother Oleg, have been placed under house arrest until late March pending charges for violating coronavirus restrictions by calling people to join protests.  Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh was detained late Saturday also over violating virus measures, the same day she was due to walk free after a nine-day jail term for violating protest laws.   The head of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, Ivan Zhdanov, said Saturday the Investigative Committee informed him that a criminal case on fraud charges had been launched against Navalny.   In December last year, investigators said they were initiating a probe into Navalny allegedly misappropriating over $4 million of donations to his organisations.   Days after Navalny was taken into custody, his team released a video report alleging Putin had been gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast, garnering over 100 million views on YouTube.  The Kremlin has denied that the Russian president owns the opulent complex, which according to Navalny features an underground ice hockey arena, a private casino and vineyards.  State television on Friday sought to rebut opposition claims the Black Sea property was a luxurious palace by airing footage of it under construction.  Billionaire Arkady Rotenberg -- Putin's former judo partner who is under Western sanctions -- said Saturday he was the owner of the property and that he was building a hotel there.   acl/bp   FACEBOOK    GOOGLE",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

At least 45 people died after the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Friday, triggering panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  Dozens of bodies have been hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of about 110,000 in West Sulawesi province, while others were killed south of the area after the quake struck.  ""The latest data we have is 45"" dead, said Arianto from the rescue agency in Mamuju, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.  The toll was up from 42 on Friday evening.  Authorities have not given a figure for the number of residents who could be trapped under levelled buildings, including a hospital that collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff inside.  At least one hotel had partially collapsed, while the regional governor's office also suffered extensive damage.  About 15,000 residents have fled to temporary shelters and nearly 190 people were being treated for serious injuries, local authorities said.    - 'Heartfelt solidarity' -    The Pope said he was ""saddened"" to learn of the quake.  ""His Holiness Pope Francis expresses his heartfelt solidarity with all those affected by this natural disaster,"" the Vatican said in a statement.  ""He prays for the repose of the deceased, the healing of the injured and the consolation of all who grieve.""  Images from the scene Friday showed residents trying to flee Mamuju in cars and motorbikes as they drove past corrugated metal roofs and other building debris scattered on the roadside.   But landslides triggered by heavy rains and the quake blocked the main access road out of the seaside city.  The meteorological agency warned residents that the area could be hit by strong aftershocks and to avoid the beachfront in case of a tsunami.  The city's airport had also been damaged, authorities said.  The Indonesian Red Cross said it was rushing medical and relief supplies to the scene, with its teams working to help find trapped residents.  Save the Children warned that the young were among the most at risk.  ""While the extent of the earthquake damage is still unclear, we know children are often the most vulnerable following disaster,"" it said.  ""It will be essential that children are prioritised in any response, as they may have witnessed the death of loved ones or become separated from their parents.""  The quake's epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and it had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres.  Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.   In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.  bur-pb/axn",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

The Southeast Asian archipelago relies heavily on air transport to connect its thousands of islands but has suffered a string of deadly plane crashes in recent years.   The aviation sector is expanding fast as its economy booms but there are concerns airlines are struggling to find enough well-trained personnel to keep up with the rapid growth.   Once banned from European airspace over safety fears, the EU removed all Indonesian airlines from its safety blacklist in 2018 following improvements.  Here are the worst aviation disasters in the nation's history:  - Northern Sumatra -  The worst disaster in Indonesia's aviation history left 234 dead in 1997. An Airbus A-300B4 operated by national carrier Garuda Indonesia crashed in a smog-shrouded ravine in North Sumatra, just short of Medan's airport.  - Lion Air -  A Boeing 737 MAX 8 from budget airline Lion Air crashes off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018, killing 189 passengers and crew members.  Investigators cite problems with the plane's anti-stall system as one of the contributing factors.   - Java Sea -  In 2014, an AirAsia plane plunged into the Java Sea during stormy weather, killing 162 people. The plane was flying from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.    - Medan disaster -  A Mandala Airlines domestic flight crashed shortly after take-off in 2005 into a densely populated suburb in Medan, a city of two million on the island of Sumatra, killing at least 150 including passengers, crew and people on the ground.  - Military families -     In June 2015 an Indonesian military plane crashed shortly after takeoff, also coming down in a residential area in Medan, killing around 122 people on board, many of them servicemen and women and their families. Around 20 people were also killed on the ground and several housing blocks torn apart.  - Air Force fire -  In 1991, an Air Force plane crashed in East Jakarta minutes after take off when an engine caught fire, killing 135 people according to reports. Those who died included 121 airmen, 12 crew and two people on the ground. One passenger survived.   - River crash -  In 1997, a Silk Air flight crashed into a river near the Indonesian city of Palembang while on its way to Singapore from Jakarta. All 104 passengers and crew were killed in what was investigated as a possible pilot murder-suicide.  - New Year's Day crash -  An Adam Air plane plunged into the sea off Sulawesi island on New Year's Day 2007, killing all 102 people on board. The airline was later banned from flying. Indonesian authorities said the pilots lost control after becoming preoccupied with malfunctioning navigational equipment.    bur-ecl/rox/rma     BOEING    AIRBUS GROUP    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

In mid-July, Ovsyannikova staged a one-woman protest near the Kremlin, holding a poster that read ""Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists.""   Three ""blood-soaked"" toy dolls were laid on the ground in front of her.  She now faces up to 10 years in prison, if convicted.  ""A criminal case has been launched,"" lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov told AFP, adding they were waiting for investigators to decide on a pre-trial measure for the 44-year-old.  Ovsyannikova has been charged with spreading information about the Russian armed forces deemed false by the government and will spend the night in pre-trial detention, said Zakhvatov.  In an interview with AFP last week, Ovsyannikova had expressed hope that the authorities would not place her in pre-trial detention because she has two children.  Writing on messaging app Telegram earlier in the day, Ovsyannikova said that 10 members of law enforcement had raided her home at 6:00 am (0300 GMT).  ""They scared my young daughter,"" she added.  In March, Ovsyannikova, then an editor at Channel One television, shot to prominence when she barged onto the set of its flagship Vremya (Time) evening news, holding a poster reading ""No War"" in English.   Criticism of Putin's decision to send troops to Ukraine has been virtually outlawed in Russia, and her protest made headlines around the world.  French President Emmanuel Macron has offered Ovsyannikova, who worked for Russian state TV for 19 years, asylum or other forms of consular protection.  Putin launched the attack on Ukraine after a historic crackdown on the opposition, with top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in prison and his political organisations outlawed.   Authorities are now seeking to snuff out the last vestiges of dissent, and nearly all well-known activists are now in jail or out of the country.  Earlier this year prominent Putin critics Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza were put in pre-trial jail for denouncing Moscow's Ukraine offensive.  The criminal probe against Ovsyannikova was launched after two Moscow courts ordered the journalist to pay fines for discrediting the Russian army on various occasions.  Writing on Telegram on Wednesday, she said that more than 350 children had already died in Ukraine.  ""How many children have to die before you stop?"" she added.     - 'Unenviable' -    In the months following her TV protest, Ovsyannikova spent time abroad, working for Germany's Die Welt for three months.  In early July, she announced that she was returning to Russia to settle a dispute over the custody of her two children.  Since her return, Ovsyannikova came out to support opposition politician Yashin in court and published anti-government posts online. She was briefly detained by police near her home in mid-July.  While many hailed Ovsyannikova, her TV protest in March has also drawn hostile reactions from many quarters.  Some members of the Russian opposition have blamed her for jumping ship in an opportunistic move and seeking fame.   Anti-Kremlin satirist and commentator Viktor Shenderovich said on Wednesday he was wrong about Ovsyannikova.  ""I was sceptical about what Channel One editor Marina Ovsyannikova had done -- and it turns out I was wrong,"" he wrote on Facebook.  ""Today Marina pays a serious price for this, and deserves both respect and support.""  Ovsyannikova had told AFP last week her fate was ""unenviable"" but that she would continue speaking up.

Russia, increasingly isolated due to Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, is seeking to find new clients for its embattled space programme in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.  Last week, The Washington Post quoted anonymous Western intelligence officials as saying that Russia ""plans to use the satellite for several months or longer"" to assist its war efforts before allowing Iran to take control.  The space agency of Iran, which has maintained ties with Moscow and refrained from criticism of the Ukraine invasion, stressed on Sunday that the Islamic republic would control the satellite ""from day one"" in an apparent reaction to the Post's report.    - Oil supplies to three nations halted -    The supply of Russian oil to three European countries through Ukraine has been halted as the transit payment cannot be processed due to sanctions, Russian firm Transneft says.  It says deliveries to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have been affected and that the Ukrainian side stopped the oil transport ""due to not receiving funds for these services"".   Since President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine, Washington and Brussels have slapped unprecedented sanctions on Moscow, cutting Russia off from international financial institutions.   The EU has looked to reduce its dependence on Russian energy resources and has agreed to ban more than two-thirds of Russian oil imports.    - Explosions at Crimea airfield -      Ammunition has detonated at an airfield in Moscow-annexed Crimea but there were no victims, the Russian defence ministry says.   ""Several aviation munitions detonated"" near the settlement of Novofyodorovka, it says in a statement carried by Russian news agencies. ""As a result of the explosion no one was hurt.""    - Two more grain ships leave Ukraine -    Two more cargo ships carrying grain have left Ukraine, Kyiv's infrastructure ministry says, under a deal with Russia to ease agricultural exports from Ukrainian ports that had been blocked by the war.  It said that one of the ships, the Rahmi Yaggi, was bound for Turkey with 5,300 tons of products, while the Ocean Lion was carrying some 65,000 tons of corn to South Korea.  With the departures, a total of 12 ships have left three different Ukrainian Black Sea ports under the deal brokered in late July by the UN and Turkey.  Exports from Ukraine -- one of the world's biggest grain producers -- had been halted by a Russian naval blockade and Ukrainian mining of the ports.  burs-jmy/eab/kjm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

The raid was just the most recent episode in which the former US leader was accused of playing loose with and abusing classified information.    - Iranian missile site -    As president, Trump had the power to unilaterally declassify information. But some of his actions stunned the US intelligence community nonetheless.  On August 30, 2019 he tweeted what was believed to be a classified high-resolution image of an Iranian rocket launch site.  ""The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir [Space Launch Vehicle] Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,"" Trump tweeted.    - Israeli intelligence -    On May 10, 2017  Trump met Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the White House Oval Office.   In the meeting, Trump told the two Russians about intelligence the United States had received from a Middle East ally about an Islamic State plot.  The highly classified intelligence, it turned out, came from Israel, which was upset by the disclosure, according to media reports.    - Location of nuclear subs -    In April 2017 Trump told Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte that two US nuclear submarines were off the coast of North Korea, boasting of ""a lot of firepower,"" according to a Philippines transcript of their call.  The Pentagon only very rarely discloses the location of its submarines, which are crucial to the US strategic defense force.    - Secret nuclear weapons -    In a 2019 interview Trump told writer Bob Woodward about an unknown US nuclear capability that may have been a specious boast, or divulged highly secret information.  ""I have built a nuclear, a weapons system that nobody's ever had in this country before,"" Trump told Woodward.   ""We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before,"" he added.    - Details of Special Forces raid -    After a US operation killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria in October 2019, Trump, boasting of the attack, revealed numerous details that the Pentagon would normally withhold, like how many helicopters were involved, how the commandos entered the residence, and that the US had intelligence from Islamic State use of phones and the internet.   The information ""could contribute to a reverse engineering of our intelligence methods by the adversary,"" former special operations commander Michael Nagata told Politico.    - Secrecy with Putin -    Trump also withheld intelligence from his spy chiefs. In July 2018 Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, was visibly surprised at the Aspen Security Forum when the host told him the White House had tweeted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to visit Washington.  ""Say that again?"" Coats said.  A year later, Coats said he was in the dark about what Trump discussed in a two-hour, one-on-one meeting with the wily Russian leader three days earlier.

""Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory,"" they said, adding that officials who sought to do so could face serious professional and criminal consequences.  Referring to the election process and peaceful transfers of power as ""hallmarks of our democracy,"" the secretaries noted that other than Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860 that ultimately led to the pro-slavery South seceding and the US Civil War, the country has had an unbroken record of peaceful transitions.  ""This year should be no exception,"" they wrote.

Ballot counting began after polls closed on Wednesday in the oil-rich nation, where multi-party elections were only introduced in 1992.  Preliminary results published overnight by Angola's electoral commission gave the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) 60.65 percent of the vote with 33 percent of ballots counted.   The main opposition group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by charismatic leader Adalberto Costa Junior, was at 33.85 percent.  The MPLA has ruled Angola for nearly 50 years after the country gained independence from Portugal.  Residents in Luanda reacted with mixed feelings to the preliminary count that was given ample coverage by local media, with state newspaper Jornal de Angola's front page on Thursday saying: ""MPLA leads the count.""  ""I voted for UNITA, and I do not believe in these results,"" said Jorge, a 40-year-old mechanic who did not give his surname, accusing the electoral commission of being in cahoots with the ruling party.   ""I feel really bad. The country is not going to change, it's always the same story.""  Lourenco, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised a new era for the southern African nation when he succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago, has trumpeted a list of achievements.  He is credited with making far-reaching reforms, including boosting financial transparency and efficiency in parastatal organisations, fighting sweeping nepotism and corruption, and promoting business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors.  ""I am happy, the MPLA has given young people opportunities, there is more work and transparency,"" said 27-year-old shopkeeper Madalena Antonio commenting on the early results.   ""The government did what it could do. Things will get better.""    - Economic woes -    But UNITA's deputy leader Abel Chivukuvuku said the party's own tally showed it was ahead.  ""Our poll counting centres... give us clear provisional indication of a winning trend for UNITA in all provinces of the country,"" he told a live streamed night conference. ""We are confident, calm and tranquil.""  The MPLA traditionally wields a grip over the electoral process, and state media and opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering.  Results in past elections have been contested, in a process that can take several weeks.  More than 14 million people were registered to vote.  The election has been overshadowed by Angola's many woes -- a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought, compounded by the death of a former strongman president.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza also nurtured corruption and nepotism under dos Santos, who died in Spain last month.  The low-key, night-time repatriation of his remains in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre touch to the election.

On Sunday, the three countries held a new round of talks by video conference in the virtual presence of South African officials, as well as other international observers. South Africa currently holds the African Union's rotating chair.   ""The meeting concluded ... that this week will be devoted to bilateral talks between the three countries, the experts, and the observers,"" Sudan's water ministry said in a statement.   This week's talks will pave the way ""for the resumption of tripartite negotiations on Sunday January 10 in the hope of concluding by the end of January,"" it noted.    Egypt, which depends on the Nile for about 97 percent of its irrigation and drinking water, fears Ethiopia's dam would severely cut its water share.   Sudan hopes the dam will help ameliorate flooding, but has also warned that millions of lives would be at ""great risk"" if no binding agreement was reached.   Ethiopia says the hydroelectric power produced at the dam is vital to meet the power needs of its population.  It insists downstream countries' water supplies will not be affected.   The Nile, the world's longest river, is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to the 10 countries it traverses.  Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Niles, converge in the Sudanese capital Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84030880']

""It's a new day in Congress,"" Williams said as she walked the halls of Capitol Hill Sunday, her first official day as a US lawmaker.  Williams, from Georgia, is taking over the House seat of none other than legendary late civil rights icon John Lewis.  Her priority in the opening weeks? Given that she ""didn't know if I was going to live or die"" during her three-week illness, Williams said her top priority is building up a national response to the coronavirus.  By constitutional mandate a new Congress is sworn in every two years on January 3, which accounts for this rare weekend session.  The incoming freshman class consists of 59 new members including Williams and, on the opposite side of the aisle, members such as the far right conservative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who supports the controversial and widely debunked Q Anon conspiracy movement.  Sunday looked decidedly different than other opening days, with members wearing face masks as they raised their right hands to take their oath of office.  Social distancing was mandated -- but not always adhered to -- on the House and Senate floor to undertake one of their first tasks, the election of speaker of the House. Democrat Nancy Pelosi narrowly won a vote to remain in the role after serving as speaker for the past two years.  But a dark political cloud hung over Washington.  And the divisions were underscored when a staggering audio tape was released Sunday in which President Donald Trump asked Georgia officials to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his election defeat, sending shockwaves through Washington.  ""To say the 117th Congress convenes at a challenging time would indeed be an understatement,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told his chamber after Vice President Mike Pence swore in new members.  ""From political division to a deadly pandemic to adversaries around the world, the hurdles before us are many and they are serious.""    - 'Clean conscience' -    On Wednesday a joint session of Congress is set to certify the Electoral College vote that confirms Joe Biden as the next president. But Republican rebels will throw the centuries-old process -- whose certification vote is normally a drama-free formality -- into turmoil.  Several loyalists to outgoing President Donald Trump have signaled they oppose certification, repeating Trump's baseless argument that the Democrat stole the election through massive fraud. The outlandish gambit is all but assured to fail, but the explosive nature of contesting the process itself will be a strain on democracy.  Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger urged Trump loyalists to reconsider opposing certification in light of the Georgia tape.  ""This is absolutely appalling. To every member of Congress considering objecting to the election results, you cannot -- in light of this -- do so with a clean conscience,"" he tweeted.  Republican incoming congressman Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin said he remained unsure about siding with the rebels or voting to confirm Biden's presidency.  ""I haven't figured it out yet,"" he told AFP.  For Williams, the path was clear, however: ""The voters have spoken, and it's time that we move forward with a peaceful transfer of power,"" she said.  New US Senator John Hickenlooper, a seasoned former governor of Colorado and a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, said he was honored to be in his new role but waved off concerns about the Wednesday vote.  ""On January 20 Joe Biden is going to become the president,"" he told AFP. ""Obviously there's a lot of politics between now and then.""  Pence, who oversees Wednesday's vote, ignored reporters' questions about how he will handle the potentially disruptive scenario.  But Emanuel Cleaver, a House Democrat and ordained minister, appealed for divine intervention as he delivered the chamber's opening prayer and sought strength for lawmakers to control their ""tribal tendencies"" and work together.  ""God, at a moment when many believe that the bright light of democracy is beginning to dim, empower us with an extra dose of commitment to its principles,"" Cleaver said.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported several wounded in the attack after midnight in the Tal Saman area in Raqa province, but did not give an exact figure.  There was no immediate Russian report of the incident, which occurred in a broader area controlled by Kurdish-led forces but where the Syrian regime and its ally Russia are also present.  A statement circulated on social media and attributed to the Al-Qaeda-linked Hurras al-Deen jihadist group claimed the attack.  The Observatory said two men parked an explosives-laden pickup truck outside the base and fled, in what was a rare such assault by Hurras al-Deen in the area.  ""It's the first such direct attack against a Russian base in northeastern Syria,"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said.  Hurras al-Deen has fighters in the country's last major rebel bastion in the northwestern region of Idlib, but very rarely operates outside that area.  Russia entered Syria's war in 2015, and its air force has backed Damascus regime forces in several deadly military campaigns against Idlib.  Russia has repeatedly accused rebels in Idlib of attacking its Hmeimim airbase west of the opposition stronghold with drones, but car bomb attacks are much rarer.  Russian troops are stationed in northern Syria, including as part of several deals brokered with rebel backer Turkey.  Syria's war has killed more than 387,000 people and displaced millions from their homes since starting in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105008734']

More than 170 people were still missing, two days after a wall of water and debris hurtled down a valley in the northern state of Uttarakhand, destroying bridges and roads, hitting two hydroelectric power plants and killing 32.  The disaster has been blamed on rapidly melting glaciers in the Himalayan region caused by global warming.   Building activity for dams and dredging riverbeds for sand and the clearing of trees for new roads -- some to beef up defence on the Chinese border -- are other factors.  Most of those missing were employees at two of the many hydro plants being built around Uttarakhand, a mountainous and ecologically fragile state slightly smaller than Switzerland.  Hundreds of rescue workers were involved in the operation across the state, using helicopters equipped with surface-penetrating high-definition cameras, as well as sniffer dogs.  On Tuesday the focus was attempting to locate and extract 34 workers who rescuers hoped were still alive in air pockets in a tunnel system filled with icy water and debris.  Workers toiled throughout the day and as darkness fell the operation was ongoing.  ""We are trying to clear the slush inside the tunnel but it has been difficult,"" said rescue official PK Tiwari.   ""We are trying to use drones and other tools to get a clearer picture of the situation inside.""

Police had failed to stop the underground event, which drew around 2,500 people from Thursday night in two disused warehouses in Lieuron, south of the city of Rennes in Brittany.  Such mass gatherings are banned across France to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and a nationwide 8:00 pm curfew -- which was not lifted for New Year -- has been in force across the country.   Techno music blared out during the night from the warehouses, which had been transformed into illegal nightclubs for partygoers who had flocked to the site from across France and even from abroad.  The local prefecture said Saturday the music had been switched off and sound systems dismantled after two nights, and the first revellers began leaving the site before dawn.  By 10:15 am it was under the control of police, the local prefecture said.  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a tweet that police had booked more than 1,200 people and seized a truck, sound equipment and generators from the site of the ""illegal rave party.""  The large police presence at the site had led to the break-up of the event ""without violence"", he added.  The regional prefect, Emmanuel Berthier, said 800 people had been booked specifically for coronavirus-related offences such as failing to respect the curfew restrictions or wear masks, or for participating in an illegal assembly.  Police fined several hundred others for use of narcotics, he told reporters.    - 'We had to party' -     Police on access roads were checking all those leaving the site, on foot or in vehicles, using torches to check their eyes for signs of drugs use, an AFP photographer said.  Police reinforcements continued to arrive and close off the site in a calm atmosphere Saturday morning, the photographer said.  ""It's been a year since we could do anything,"" said 24-year-old partygoer Antoine. The salesman was part of a group of five from Brittany that attended the rave.  With drawn faces but with beers still in their hands, the group said they ""had come to celebrate the 31st here because it was a huge party"".  ""We knew what we were risking... we had to party, for a year everything has been stuck,"" said one of the group, a 20-year-old waitress.  Alexis, a 22-year-old baker, said ""at one point you say to yourself: 'I am going to force my New Year'.""  He added that the rave had even been reported in the New York Times, saying ""it was the biggest party of the year"".    - 'Lives in danger' -    French authorities have been worried about mass rave parties throughout the pandemic, but New Year's Eve was a particular concern.  On Thursday night the police had tried to ""prevent the event but faced fierce hostility from many partygoers"" who set one of their cars on fire and threw bottles and stones, the prefecture said Friday.  First aid workers had distributed hand gel and masks at the event to try and limit the spread of the coronavirus.  The regional health authority in Brittany noted the ""high risk of the spread of Covid-19"" at the event, and called on those who took part to undergo coronavirus tests and self-isolate immediately for seven days.  The prefecture said in a tweet that a testing centre had been set up in a gymnasium in Lieuron.  ""They have put their lives in danger, their health, they must now protect those around them,"" it said.  The organisers of the party are still being sought, local police said, and an investigation has been launched.  The French government, facing the threat of a new wave of Covid-19 infections, announced on Friday it was extending its overnight curfew by two hours in 15 regions to help combat the virus, starting it at 6:00 pm instead of 8.  The country recorded around 20,000 new cases and 133 deaths on Friday, bringing the total number of fatalities to almost 64,800.  lg-gvy-cbo/dl/jj   Twitter    THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104641253']

Washington separately warned Moscow was preparing to hold ""sham"" referendums in occupied areas that would seek to formalise its control.  The Russian missile strike on Chaplino station, in central Dnipropetrovsk region, had killed 15 people and wounded 50 others, Zelensky said at the start of a speech to the UN Security Council.  ""Four passenger cars are on fire. Rescuers are working on the spot, but the death toll may rise unfortunately,"" he added. ""This is our daily life.""  Zelensky was speaking on the day the nation celebrated its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union -- and on the day marking six months since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops to invade.  Over the weekend, he had warned that Russia might do something ""particularly cruel"" on Ukraine's independence day.  In Washington, a senior official warned that Russia could begin announcing referendums designed to formalise its control of occupied areas as soon as this week.  ""Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda,"" White House national security coordinator John Kirby said.  ""In fact, we can see a Russian announcement of the first one or ones before the end of this week.""  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid a surprise visit to Kyiv, hailing Ukraine's six-month long resistance, as sirens sounded throughout the day.  Putin had failed to account for the ""strong will of Ukrainians to resist"", Johnson said.  ""You defend your right to live in peace, in freedom, and that's why Ukraine will win,"" he added.  Earlier the Ukrainian leader had issued his own defiant morning video address, declaring: ""We don't care what army you have, we only care about our land. We will fight for it until the end.""  Referring to Russia he vowed Ukraine ""will not try to find an understanding with terrorists"".  ""For us Ukraine is the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. ""All 25 regions, without any concession or compromise.""    - Fresh aid -    The US, meanwhile, announced $3 billion in fresh military aid.  The new funding will help Kyiv acquire more materiel for its armed forces, locked in a grinding war of attrition with Russian troops in the east and south, with neither side advancing significantly.  Johnson unveiled his own £54 million ($64 million) package of aid, including 2,000 ""state-of-the-art drones"" as well as anti-tank munitions.  Gatherings were banned in the capital Kyiv and Zelensky had urged citizens to be on guard against ""Russian terror"".  Nevertheless he and his wife marked a minute of silence for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and laid yellow and blue floral bouquets at a memorial in central Kyiv.  Johnson's visit was accompanied by other messages of support from Ukraine's allies.  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the anniversary of the start of Russia's war in Ukraine a ""sad and tragic milestone"".  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU has been standing with Ukraine ""from the very beginning"" and ""will be for as long as it takes"".  Even Alexander Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader of Belarus congratulated Ukraine on its Independence Day, comments dismissed by a spokesman for the Ukrainian presidency.  Belarus offered its territory as a staging ground for Russia's invasion.    - Muted anniversary -    In the early days and weeks of Russia's invasion, Kyiv was under siege by Russian troops which reached the suburbs of the capital.  Moscow's offensive quickly faltered, and its forces withdrew in late March to regroup for assaults on Ukraine's east and south.  But in the capital, Ukrainians were sombre about the anniversary.   ""Six months, the peace of life has been broken in every family,"" Nina, an 80-year-old pensioner, said on Independence Square on Tuesday.  ""How much destruction, how many dead, how can we relate to it?"" she asked.  The capital city's administration shut public service centres on Wednesday and Thursday, and shopping centres said they would close for the anniversary over safety concerns.   However in central Kyiv trailing crowds of people inspected dozens of disabled Russian tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles installed near the government quarter to showcase Ukraine's military prowess.  Candy floss vendors sold to curious visitors who peered down tank barrels and posed for selfies, draped in the Ukrainian flag.   Discussions continued on how to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, occupied by Russian troops and threatened by shelling, which Moscow blames on Kyiv.  The two sides traded accusations at a Tuesday meeting of the UN Security Council on Zaporizhzhia.  Ukraine and its allies have demanded Russia pull its troops out of the plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- and agree to a demilitarised zone.  And on Wednesday the head of Russia's state nuclear energy agency met the IAEA chief to follow up on the expected inspection.  bur-jts/bp-jj/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

""We won 30 departments"" out of the 46 in the west African country and overseas constituencies, Aminata Toure, head of the presidential coalition, told reporters late Sunday.  ""This undoubtedly gives us a majority in the National Assembly.""   ""We have given a majority in the National Assembly to our coalition president"", Sall, she added, without giving the number of seats won by her camp or whether it was an absolute or relative majority.  Toure however acknowledged her coalition had been defeated in the capital Dakar in Sunday's vote.  The opposition was swift in rejecting Toure's claims.  Barthelemy Dias, a leader of the main opposition coalition headed by former presidential candidate Ousmane Sonko, spoke of ""vulgar lies"" and a ""prefabricated majority"" on private radio RFM.  ""Cohabitation is inevitable. You lost this election at the national level. We will not accept it. This abuse will not pass,"" said Dias, who is also the mayor of Dakar.  The opposition had hoped the elections would impose a cohabitation, or divided government, on Sall and curb any ambitions he may have for a third term.  Sunday's polls were an important test for Sall after local elections in March saw the opposition win in major cities, including Dakar, Ziguinchor in the south and Thies in the west.  The single round of voting will decide the 165 seats of the single-chamber parliament -- currently controlled by the president's supporters -- for the next five years.  Sall has promised to appoint a prime minister -- a position he abolished and then restored in December 2021 -- from the winning camp.    - Opposition collaboration -    Some seven million Senegalese were eligible to vote in the election, which passed without any major incidents.  Turnout at several polling stations appeared relatively low, according to AFP correspondents and observers, and the interior ministry said participation had reached 22 percent by 1 pm.  Provisional overall results are expected no later than Friday.  ""I hope... there are no disputes,"" said Lamine Sylva, a 60-year-old artist who voted at a school in Mbao, near Dakar.  ""It's like football -- there is a winner and a loser.""  Yahya Sall, a retired soldier, said he hoped the new parliament ""will have a strong opposition presence... to advance democracy"".  The national election commission has deployed 22,000 observers nationwide. Experts from the regional ECOWAS bloc were also present.  Lawmakers are elected according to a system that combines proportional representation, with national lists for 53 lawmakers, and majority voting in the country's departments for 97 others.  The diaspora elects the remaining 15 members of parliament.  This year, eight coalitions are in the running, including Yewwi Askan Wi (""Liberate the People"" in Wolof), the main opposition coalition of Sonko, which came third in the 2019 presidential election.  But he and other members of the coalition were banned from running in Sunday's elections on technical grounds.  Ahead of the poll, Yewwi Askan Wi joined forces with Wallu Senegal (""Save Senegal""), led by former president Abdoulaye Wade.  The two groups agreed to work together to obtain a parliamentary majority and ""force governmental cohabitation"".    - Rising prices -    The vote took place against a backdrop of rising prices, in part because of the war in Ukraine.  The opposition has questioned the priorities of the government, which has highlighted its subsidies for oil products and food as well as infrastructure building.   ""Is the priority of the Senegalese to build beautiful stadiums, new highways while people are not eating?"" Sonko said after casting his ballot in Ziguinchor.  The opposition also wants to force Sall to give up any hope of running for a third term.   Sall, 60, was elected in 2012 for seven years then re-elected in 2019 for another five. He has been accused of wanting to break the two-term limit and run again in 2024.  He has remained vague on the subject, but any defeat of his supporters in Sunday's vote could upset such plans.  ""If Macky Sall loses them (the legislative elections), he will no longer talk about a third term,"" Sonko said.  The 21-day election campaign passed in a mostly calm atmosphere.

Dugin -- an outspoken ultranationalist intellectual and a vocal supporter of the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine -- is thought to have been the likely target of the attack.   ""The crime was prepared and committed by Ukrainian special services,"" the FSB said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.   It added that the perpetrator -- a female Ukrainian citizen born in 1979 -- on Sunday fled to EU member Estonia.  The FSB in its statement identified the woman as Natalia Vovk.   Daria Dugina was killed Saturday when a bomb placed in a Toyota Land Cruiser went off as she drove on a highway some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside Moscow.  According to the FSB statement, the attacker arrived in Russia in July 2022 with her underage daughter and rented an apartment in the same building where Dugina lived.   The supposed attacker followed Dugina in a Mini Cooper with registration plates issued in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and in the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, the FSB added.   The FSB said the attacker was at a festival outside Moscow that Dugin and his daughter attended on Saturday.   Reports from Russian media suggested Dugina borrowed her father's car at the last minute.   Dugin, 60, sometimes called ""Putin's Rasputin"" or ""Putin's brain,"" is an outspoken Russian ultranationalist intellectual.  He has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking territories in a vast new Russian empire and wholeheartedly supported Moscow's operation in Ukraine.   He was put on a Western sanctions list after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a move he also backed.  A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhaylo Podolyak, on Sunday denied that Kyiv authorities were behind the bombing.  bur/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113565637']

On Wednesday, investigators detained Ovsyannikova, 44, and charged her with spreading information about the Russian armed forces deemed false by the government.   The mother of two faces up to 10 years in prison, if convicted.  In March, Ovsyannikova, then an editor at Channel One television, made global headlines when she barged onto the set of its flagship Vremya (Time) evening news, holding a poster reading ""No War"".  The house arrest is not connected to that particular protest, however.    It is linked to a one-woman protest in mid-July near the Kremlin, when Ovsyannikova held a poster that read ""Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists"".   Three ""blood-soaked"" toy dolls were laid on the ground in front of her.  At Moscow's Basmanny district court on Thursday, she was placed in a cage surrounded by several policemen.  She held a sign that read ""May the dead children haunt you in your dreams"".  Her lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov wrote on messaging app Telegram that that ""even"" the Soviet Union's most brutal serial killer Andrei Chikatilo was not guarded so closely.  During a closed-door hearing, the court ruled that Ovsyannkova be placed under house arrest until October 9.  ""I even don't know what to say. Good that it is not jail? Certainly good,"" Zakhvatov said.   ""But it is still sickening.""  Criticism of Putin's decision to send troops to Ukraine on February 24 has been virtually outlawed in Russia.  French President Emmanuel Macron has offered Ovsyannikova, who worked for Russian state TV for 19 years, asylum or other forms of consular protection.  Earlier this year prominent Putin critics Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza were put in pre-trial jail for denouncing Moscow's Ukraine offensive.  The criminal probe against Ovsyannikova was launched after two Moscow courts ordered the journalist to pay fines for discrediting the Russian army on various occasions.  In the months following her TV protest, Ovsyannikova spent time abroad, working for Germany's Die Welt for three months.  In early July, she said she was returning to Russia to settle a dispute over the custody of her two children.  Since her return, Ovsyannikova came out to support opposition politician Yashin in court and published anti-government posts online.

In a rapidly evolving sequence of events, Facebook and YouTube took down videos posted by Trump, and Twitter followed suit as the platforms claimed he was inciting violent protests by his supporters, who stormed the US Capitol building.  Twitter said Trump's messages were violations of the platform's rules on civic integrity and that any future violations ""will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account,"" his social media handle followed by some 88 million people.  The messaging platform said Trump's account would be locked for 12 hours and that if the offending tweets are not removed, ""the account will remain locked.""  The response from social media came amid accusations the president was attempting a coup, with protesters storming the Capitol building seeking to derail the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.  ""This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video,"" Facebook vice president of integrity Guy Rosen said in a tweet.  ""We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.""  YouTube also removed a Trump video that repeated his baseless attacks on the integrity of the election he lost in November, following its policy barring claims challenging election results.  ""As the situation at the United States Capitol Building unfolds, our teams are working to quickly remove livestreams and other content that violates our policies, including those against incitement to violence or regarding footage of graphic violence,"" said YouTube spokesperson Alex Joseph.  Facebook subsequently said it would search for and remove content which praised the storming of the Capitol or encouraged the violence.  The massive social network said it would also seek to take down additional calls for protests, including peaceful ones, if they violate a curfew imposed by the city of Washington, or any attempts to ""restage"" the storming of Congress.    - 'A disgrace' -    ""The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,"" a Facebook spokesperson said.  ""We prohibit incitement and calls for violence on our platform. We are actively reviewing and removing any content that breaks these rules.""  Facebook maintained that it was in contact with law enforcement officials and continued to enforce bans on QAnon conspiracy group, militarized social movements, and hate groups.

Biden instructed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) earlier this month to take action to end the controversial ""Remain in Mexico"" program put in place by his predecessor Donald Trump.    It saw tens of thousands of non-Mexican asylum seekers -- mostly from Central America -- sent back over the border pending the outcome of their asylum applications, creating a humanitarian crisis in the area, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.   ""Beginning on February 19, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will begin phase one of a program to restore safe and orderly processing at the southwest border,"" the agency announced in a statement.  It said there are approximately 25,000 active cases still. Candidates will be tested first for the coronavirus, a senior DHS official who asked not to be identified told reporters.  At least 70,000 people were returned to Mexico under the agreement from January 2019, when the program began to be implemented, through December 2020, according to the NGO American Immigration Council.  US authorities emphasized that they are working closely with the Mexican government and with international organizations and NGOs at the border.    DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas, who is the first Latino and the first immigrant to head the department, stressed that Washington is committed to ""rebuilding a safe, orderly and humane immigration system.""    ""This latest action is another step in our commitment to reform immigration policies that do not align with our nation's values,"" Mayorkas said in a statement.    The program was part of Trump's hardline plan to fight illegal immigration, one of the hallmarks of his administration and which included efforts to build a border wall and the policy which separated children from thousands of migrant families.  After Biden took office on January 20, his administration announced that it would reverse the most controversial measures and created a task force to reunite families that remain separated, a policy his administration has termed a ""national shame.""     On the day Biden was inaugurated, the DHS announced the suspension of new registrations in the ""Remain in Mexico"" program and asked all those enrolled to stay where they are while waiting to be informed about their cases.

On Sunday, demonstrators defied government warnings and rallied across the country -- including in Moscow and Saint Petersburg where authorities enforced unprecedented lockdowns of the city centre --  in a second weekend of mass protests over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent.  The protests -- stretching from the Pacific port of Vladivostok to the northwestern city of Pskov -- came ahead of a high-profile court hearing that could see Navalny imprisoned for several years.  Navalny's detention and the crackdown on protesters has sparked an outcry in the West.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is expected to press the Kremlin to free Navalny when he heads to Moscow on Thursday.  Navalny, 44, is facing charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for embezzlement and could be jailed for two-and-a-half years.  The General Prosecutor's Office said in a statement on Monday that it backed a request by the prison service to change the suspended sentence to jail time.  ""This motion is considered lawful and justified,"" the statement said.   Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning.   He blames the attack with the Novichok nerve agent on Putin and the FSB security agency.    - Batons and tasers -    The anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a high-security detention centre and faces years of jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.  Navalny's team has urged his sympathisers to gather in front of Moscow's Simonovsky district court on Tuesday to show support for the opposition politician.  In recent years, Navalny has served a number of brief jail stints but never a long prison term.  On Sunday, thousands of people rallied across Russia to demand freedom for Navalny and changes to Russia's tightly-controlled political system.  OVD Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 5,400 people had been detained -- a record in the history of modern Russia.  Ahead of Sunday's demonstration, authorities locked down the centre of the capital, with hundreds of police lining the streets, central metro stations closed and restrictions on the movements of pedestrians.  Protesters and monitors pointed to the police's increasingly harsh tactics, saying they used batons and tasers on peaceful demonstrators, and some were badly beaten.  In Saint Petersburg, a policeman was seen aiming his service weapon at the protesters, while in Vladivostok police used non-lethal weapons against a demonstrator, according to OVD Info.  ""Political repression is ramping up,"" Leonid Drabkin, top OVD Info coordinator, told AFP.   Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday defended the clampdown.   ""We are talking about unlawful rallies,"" he told reporters. ""Naturally, police take measures against participants of these unlawful rallies -- hence the number of detained.""  - 'Path towards trouble' -    But the Saint Petersburg ombudsman said authorities unleashed ""essentially a military operation"" against protesters and paralysed the city.  ""Batons and tasers will not solve existing problems. Violence only breeds intransigence and engenders bitterness,"" ombudsman Alexander Shishlov said in a statement.  ""This is a path towards great trouble. It's time to stop.""  Kremlin critics say a concerted effort is under way to silence Navalny's team, dismantle his Anti-Corruption Foundation and pressure his family.  On Monday, a court fined Navalny's wife Yulia 20,000 rubles ($265) for participating in an ""unauthorised"" rally in her husband's support.  Ahead of Sunday's demonstrations, Navalny's brother Oleg and several key allies including prominent activist Lyubov Sobol were placed under house arrest until March 23 for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions and calling on people to join protests.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Twitter condemned ""the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists by Russian authorities for a second week straight"".  On Monday, France urged Germany to scrap the Nordstream II gas pipeline project with Russia in protest of Navalny's detention.    as/emg/lc",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

Video footage posted on social media showed people rushing to his aid after he was attacked at the event in Chautauqua County, with police confirming a stabbing while declining to immediately identify the victim.  ""A most horrible event just happened at #chautauquainstitution - Salman Rushdie was attacked on stage at #chq2022. The amphitheater is evacuated,"" one witness said on social media.  Chautauqua County Sheriff's office said ""we can confirm there was a stabbing,"" without giving further details.  Rushdie's condition was not immediately known.  The author, now 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" brought attention beyond his imagination when it sparked a fatwa, or religious decree, calling for his death by Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of the Prophet Mohammed.  Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practising Muslims and himself is an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head -- which remains today.    - A decade in hiding -    He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell his children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defence of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.  Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honour justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa failed to stifle Rushdie's writing, however, and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton"", named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"", which runs to more than 600 pages, has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

The soon to be ex-president's motorcade slowed almost to a stop outside his fancy Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, allowing Trump to bathe in the adulation of hundreds of fans.  They stretched all the way down the road, cheering and waving Trump 2020 reelection campaign flags.  ""We love you!"" chanted one knot of people.  ""Welcome Home,"" said a homemade sign.  Another read ""Trump landslide,"" echoing the president's lie that he won the election. The woman holding the sign was in tears.  Trump had arrived in Trump Country.  This is where he and his wife Melania will now live after he was soundly defeated by Joe Biden and impeached a record second time for whipping up supporters to storm Congress on January 6.  And like the balmy winter temperatures, swaying palms and the possibility of occasional alligators, those hardcore believers are something the golf course tycoon will always be able to count on.    - Icy reception -    Just two hours earlier, things were quite different.  Trump left the White House at 8:18 am for Joint Base Andrews, the suburban Washington Air Force facility where a military ceremony was held in his honor.  Army field guns, painted black, aimed at the horizon to fire a 21 gun salute, smoke puffing over the soldiers.  An Air Force marching band advanced on the president, playing ""Hail to the Chief.""  And Trump, using the gleaming Air Force One as his television backdrop, gave a speech that sounded oddly like a campaign address when it was really a goodbye.  ""It was my greatest honor and privilege to be your president,"" he finally said. ""Have a good life.""  But although the event had the trappings of a leader at the height of power, the parade was oddly empty of the one thing Trump has always cherished most -- a big crowd.  Only about 500 people showed up, leaving almost half the space in the small area reserved for them empty, and their cheers were muted.  The early hour and icy temperatures were one reason.  But so was another kind of chill: a lot of Trump's important friends or former friends simply didn't come.  Trump's long ultra-loyal vice president Mike Pence and the allegiant Republican congressional leaders Senator Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy? They declined.  They were with Biden.  High ranking former aides like one-time chief of staff John Kelly also declined. Kelly told CNN he had prior engagements.  For Trump, it was a long, lonely walk down the red carpet rolled out to the steps of the plane.    - Race against time -    A man who habitually mocks ""losers,"" Trump had wanted to look like a president right to the end. But he had to get his timing just right to manage.  Marine One took him to Joint Base Andrews and Air Force One took him to Florida. Then the full presidential motorcade of more than 30 vehicles, including the military officer with the nuclear briefcase, took him to Mar-a-Lago.  As soon as Biden was sworn in, Trump would lose his right to all those presidential toys.  Biden took the oath at 11:48.  Trump made it through the gates of his club with minutes to spare, at 11:31 am.  Back in frigid Washington, Biden gave an inaugural speech begging Americans to come together.  ""Respect one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire,"" he said.

""In all, he broke into six houses,"" one resident in Cetinje told AFP, speaking on the condition of anonymity.   Authorities have yet to release a motive for the crime by the 34-year-old assailant that his neighbours described as a ""peaceful"" family man who worked at a nearby national park and had been the member of a local hunting club.  ""He was a peaceful and discreet man,"" said the 55-year-old neighbour of the gunman, who asked to remain anonymous. ""He was a father of four children. Nobody expected this of him.""  ""I didn't know him very well, but he was never a problem... I am shocked that he could have done this,"" added the neighbour.  In the massacre's wake, Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic announced three days of official mourning, saying the incident was unprecedented in Montenegro's recent history.  ""I invite all the citizens of Montenegro to be with the families of the innocent victims,"" he wrote in a post on Telegram late Friday.     - 'Sadness' -    Mladen Zadrima, the chief editor of Cetinje's local radio station, said residents were struggling to come to terms with the scale of the tragedy in the close-knit community of just 14,000 people.   ""The day after has not brought any relief. On the contrary, disbelief has been replaced by sadness,"" said Zadrima.    Cetinje is famed as the home of the former royal capital and produced a string of renowned painters but for decades had fallen into economic malaise following the closure of an appliances factory that had once been the lifeblood of the community.   The picturesque town surrounded by mountains briefly gained notoriety for also being the home to members of the infamous jewel heist gang known as the Pink Panthers, whose members are mainly from hailed the former Yugoslav republics.  The incident comes as Montenegro is in the full throes of its highly anticipated tourism high season following two years of the coronavirus pandemic.   With an unemployment rate of some 18 percent and an average monthly salary of under 520 euros ($533), Montenegro counts on tourism and the appeal of some 300 km (180 miles) of azure coastline along with its stunning mountains to boost its revenues.  Organised crime and corruption have remained two major issues plaguing the country which authorities have pledged to tackle under pressure from the European Union.  Mass shootings, however, have been rare in the Adriatic nation.   str-ds/ah",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113502850']

""Climate change is making the high north more important because the ice is melting and it's becoming more accessible both for economic activity and for military activity,"" he explained.

The church said several of its entities are being investigated and promised to ""fully and completely"" cooperate with the probe.  ""While we continue to grieve and lament past mistakes related to sexual abuse, current leaders across the SBC have demonstrated a firm conviction to address those issues of the past and are implementing measures to ensure they are never repeated in the future,"" the church said in a statement.  The moves comes after the church in June published a 205-page list of ministers and other church workers who have been accused of sexual abuse.  The publication of the list followed the release of an independent investigation that said the church had for years suppressed reports of sexual abuse by priests and church staff.   The list contained hundreds of entries -- some of them partially or fully redacted -- detailing allegations, convictions and some cases that were not reported to the police.   Some of the allegations on the list relate to the sexual abuse of children as young as five years old.

Fresh from protests last weekend, Navalny's aides called again for Russians to take to the streets on Sunday ahead of a court case that could see Russia's most prominent Kremlin critic put behind bars for more than three years.  The 44-year-old campaigner was detained earlier this month when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had been recuperating from exposure to a Soviet-designed toxin.  He called on his supporters in dozens of cities to rally last weekend and released a two-hour investigation into the palatial seaside property to spur allies to demonstrate.  The rallies saw a record number of arrests, and Putin on Monday denied having anything to do with the property in Navalny's video, which has now been watched 86 million times.  ""Nothing that is listed there as my property belongs to me or my close relatives, and never did,"" Putin said during a video call with Russian students.  Navalny's report -- his most-watched anti-corruption probe by far -- claims the property is worth $1.35 billion and features everything from an underground ice rink to a casino.     - 'Terrorists' jibe -    One of his key aides, Leonid Volkov, on Monday urged Russians to take to the streets again on January 31 ""for Navalny's freedom, for freedom for all, and for justice"".  Saturday's rallies saw clashes between police and protesters, 3,700 of whom were detained according to a monitoring group.  Putin said on Monday that Russian citizens have the right to express themselves but that they must do so ""within the framework of the law"".  A Moscow court on Monday handed down the first jail term following the protests, sentencing one demonstrator to 10 days in detention.  Putin also said minors should not be encouraged to join the unsanctioned rallies, referring to a claim repeated by authorities that the opposition had encouraged young people to protest.  ""That's what terrorists do. They put women and children in front of themselves,"" the Russian leader said.  - Tech firms take flak -    The Russian foreign ministry on Monday repeated claims that US diplomats had encouraged Russians to participate in the rallies and said it had lodged a ""strong protest"" with the American ambassador.   That allegation followed earlier claims by the Kremlin that the US embassy was interfering in Russian affairs by publishing protest routes ahead of the rallies.  An embassy spokeswoman told AFP that it was ""routine practice"" for diplomatic missions to issue safety messages to their citizens abroad.  The foreign ministry's spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Monday also said Russia would probe American tech companies over ""interference"" related to the demonstrations.  Ahead of the rallies, Russia's media watchdog Roskomnadzor ordered social media platforms including YouTube and Instagram to delete calls for demonstrations posted on their platforms.    Navalny's arrest was met with widespread condemnation in the West with the European Union saying it was considering new sanctions on Russia.   European diplomats said on Monday that EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell would visit Moscow early next month to press the Kremlin on Navalny's arrest.  acl/jbr/jxb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105137806']

More than 170 people were still missing, two days after a wall of water and debris hurtled down a valley in the northern state of Uttarakhand, destroying bridges and roads, hitting two hydroelectric power plants and killing 31.  The disaster has been blamed on rapidly melting glaciers in the Himalayan region caused by global warming. Building activity for dams and dredging riverbeds for sand and the clearing of trees for new roads -- some to beef up defence on the Chinese border -- are other factors.  Most of those missing were employees at two of the many hydro plants being built around Uttarakhand, home to soaring Himalayan peaks and the sources of the Ganges river.  Hundreds of rescue workers were involved in the operation across the state, using helicopters equipped with surface-penetrating high-definition cameras, as well as sniffer dogs.  On Tuesday the focus was attempting to locate and extract 34 workers who were in a network of tunnels when the 20-metre-high (70-foot) barrage of icy water and debris roared through on Sunday morning.  Workers toiled all night and police official Banudutt Nair, in charge of the rescue operation, told AFP he believed that there were air pockets where the employees could still be alive.  ""Forty-eight hours have passed and it has become a race against time. We hope they survive but there's been no contact so far,"" army rescuer Vivek Sahai said.  Giant floodlights lit up one entrance late Monday as a huge excavator slowly extracted the sludge which rescuers then sifted through.  Nearby, workers used heavy machinery to remove giant boulders from the road blocking the way to the second power plant, Rishi Ganga, where 35 people were missing.  The plant was obliterated and is now a wasteland thickly coated with viscous grey mud. At a nearby village, four bodies were recovered on Tuesday including that of a policeman.  Building projects crisscross highly-seismic Uttarakhand state despite warnings from scientists about the impact on its ecologically fragile hills and valleys.    - 'Don't let go' -    One of those who made it out was Rajesh Kumar, 28, who together with others clung to scaffolding rods in the tunnel for four hours before the water level fell and they were able to escape.  ""Suddenly there was a sound of whistling... there was shouting, people were telling us to come out. We thought it was a fire. We started running but the water gushed in. It was like a Hollywood movie,"" Kumar told AFP.  ""We just kept telling each other -- come what may, we must not let go of the rods,"" he said from his hospital bed.  Shopkeeper Ramesh Negi was enjoying the Sunday morning sun when he heard a loud roar and saw a huge wall of water smash into and sweep away a bridge.  Dozens of workers on the river bed and grazers leading their cattle along the mountain slopes disappeared beneath the sudden deluge, he recalled.  ""There was dust and screams all over,"" the 36-year-old told AFP.  ""We tried to alert the grazers but they were blown away by the wind pressure before being consumed by the water and slush. We can only guess what happened.""  Mangra, another survivor, remembered hearing a loud, rumbling sound and the screams of other colleagues: ""Run, run, run!""   The 28-year-old scrambled out of the tunnel but six of his friends and neighbours from his village didn't make it.  ""It felt like the mountain was crashing and the Earth was moving,"" Mangra told AFP outside the tunnel, cuts and scrapes on his hands and legs.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105358710']

""Mank"" earned six nominations, including best drama, followed by fellow Netflix movie ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" on five, in an announcement that offered an important, early glimpse into the movies leading this year's unique awards season.  The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which has only previously nominated five female film directors in its long history, gave Globes nods to three women in the category this year.  The unveiling of the nominations, remotely co-hosted by ""Sex and the City"" star Sarah Jessica Parker and Taraji P Henson, whittled down the list of films and stars headed for the Globes ceremony later this month -- itself seen as a bellwether for the Oscars in April.  As expected, pandemic-related theater closures and blockbuster delays boosted smaller, stay-at-home movies from streamers this year, as Netflix thrashed the competition with a whopping 22 film nominations -- up from an impressive 17 last year.  Rival Amazon Prime earned seven film nominations, including three apiece for civil rights-themed play adaptation ""One Night in Miami"" and ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.""  Sacha Baron Cohen starred in the sequel mockumentary about fictional Kazakh journalist Borat -- which famously entrapped Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani -- and earned a second acting nomination for his supporting work in ""Chicago 7,"" about the city's 1968 anti-war riots.  ""We're so honoured -- and just in case we don't win any, I've already hired Rudy Giuliani to contest the results,"" tweeted the British comedian.    - '5 Bloods' snubbed -    A small batch of prestige titles from Tinseltown's traditional major studios held their own, with Disney's ""Nomadland,"" Sony's ""The Father"" and Universal's ""Promising Young Woman"" each earning four nods.  #MeToo revenge thriller ""Promising Young Woman"" in particular exceeded expectations, with recognition for best drama, director, screenplay and actress for Carey Mulligan.  Mulligan will compete with Viola Davis for 1920s blues drama ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" as well as Frances McDormand for ""Nomadland,"" which swept the prizes at the Venice and Toronto festivals and is the pick of many experts for overall best picture.  In the acting categories, late ""Black Panther"" star Chadwick Boseman was also nominated for ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.  But he missed out on a second posthumous nod for ""Da 5 Bloods"" -- which failed to snare any nominations, despite the choice of director Spike Lee's children as this year's Globes ambassadors, and a widely praised lead performance by Delroy Lindo.  Instead the fiercely competitive best actor in a drama category will feature heavyweights such as Anthony Hopkins for ""The Father,"" adapted from a French play about dementia, and Gary Oldman for ""Mank.""  Surprisingly, Meryl Streep missed out on a nomination for Netflix musical ""The Prom,"" which saw British talk show host James Corden honored instead.    - Female directors arrive -    Last year, the HFPA was slammed for its failure to nominate any female directors, but this time Chloe Zhao (""Nomadland""), Regina King (""One Night in Miami"") and Emerald Fennell (""Promising Young Woman"") all earned nods.  Only five women had been nominated for best director across 77 previous editions of the Globes, with Barbra Streisand still the only female winner for 1983's ""Yentl."" Zhao becomes the first Asian female recognized in the category.  Disney+'s ""Hamilton,"" created from multiple performances featuring the original Broadway cast, earned two nominations, including best musical or comedy film, and best actor for creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.  It is not allowed to compete at the Oscars, meaning the Globes represent the best chance for the Tony-winning musical about the US founding fathers to scoop up film accolades.  Foreign-language films, separated out into their own Globes pool, saw acclaimed Korean-American family drama ""Minari"" nominated as it bids to emulate last year's all-conquering ""Parasite.""  In the television categories, Netflix was again dominant, scoring 20 nominations. Closest rival HBO earned seven, plus a further two for its new streaming platform HBO Max with ""The Flight Attendant.""  The latest season of British royal family drama ""The Crown"" had the most recognition with six nominations, ahead of recent Emmys smash hit ""Schitt's Creek"" on five.  The 78th Golden Globes, voted on by the 90-odd members of the HFPA, will be broadcast on February 28.

The 38-year-old former ragga singer turned politician has been the main rival to 76-year-old Museveni, who has been in power since 1986 and is seeking a sixth term.  The internet remained down for a third day as vote counting continued, with provisional results from 29 percent of polling stations giving Museveni an early lead of 63 percent while Wine trailed with 28 percent.  ""I am very confident that we defeated the dictator by far. I call upon all Ugandans to reject the blackmail. We have certainly won the election and we've won it by far,"" he told journalists.  ""The people of Uganda voted massively for change of leadership from a dictatorship to a democratic government. But Mr. Museveni is trying to paint a picture that he is in the lead. What a joke!"" said Wine.   He said the election was marred by ""illegal, high-handed actions which Museveni and his regime of blood have undertaken to set stage for the worst rigging this country has even witnessed.""  He said he would detail the irregularities once the internet was restored.  Earlier an election commission official responded to Wine's accusations of fraud and violence saying: ""Let him show the country in what manner, in what form the results are rigged.""  On Friday morning the capital Kampala was quiet and some businesses remained closed, while soldiers and police patrolled on foot the day after the election.  Full results are expected by Saturday afternoon.  Museveni is facing a total of 10 candidates, but it is the popularity of the former popstar Wine, who grew up in a slum and is nicknamed the ""ghetto president"", that has rattled the former rebel leader.  Voting in Kampala took place under the oppressive security presence of soldiers and riot police in the streets and at polling stations.  The poll followed one of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and scores of deaths.  However election commission chief Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said the vote had gone off in a ""peaceful and tranquil manner"".  Police spokesman Fred Enanga said there had been ""no major cases of violence reported.""  A senior foreign diplomat told AFP there had been sporadic incidents of violence and many irregularities but no sign of mass manipulation.     - Observers denied -    The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  The United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, cancelled a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  Wine has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.  Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  He has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the median age is 16, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  But Museveni, one of Africa's longest serving leaders, has never lost an election and observers expect this time around will be no different.  His opponents -- most visibly Wine, who spent much of the campaign in a bulletproof vest and combat helmet -- were arrested, blocked from rallying and dispersed with tear gas throughout the campaign.  Two days of protests in November led to the deaths of 54 people.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Eighteen people were confirmed dead on Monday and at least 200 others missing after the glacier broke off a mountainside, triggering a flash flood through a valley in the northern state of Uttarakhand.  Floodwaters swamped a nearby hydro complex where Kumar and his colleagues were working 300 metres (984 feet) inside a tunnel.  ""We didn't think we were going to make it,"" the 28-year-old told AFP from his hospital bed.    ""Suddenly there was a sound of whistling... there was shouting, people were telling us to come out. We thought it was a fire. We started running but the water gushed in. It was like a Hollywood movie.""

""We just kept telling each other -- come what may, we must not let go of the rods. Thank god our hands did not lose their grip,"" said Kumar.  As the flood coursed down the valley, the water started to recede in the tunnel, leaving it filled with more than five feet (1.5 metres) of debris and mud.  ""We climbed across the rock debris and forced our way to the mouth of the tunnel,"" said Kumar.  There they found a small opening but they were not sure where it led.   ""All we knew was that we could feel some air.""  Eventually, they saw some light coming through and one of the men got a phone signal and called for rescue.  There were emotional scenes as Kumar and his colleagues were pulled out of a tiny hole at the surface.   Some punched the air in joy as they saw daylight, some were put straight onto stretchers and carried away. One man put his arms in the air and then fell face-first into the mud.  They were trapped inside a flooded tunnel for four hours but miraculously managed to escape with just minor injuries.  The glacier broke away as the power complex was in full operation, and scores of workers at two power plants are still missing.  Some 35 workers were feared trapped in another tunnel.   The chief minister of Uttarakhand, Trivendra Singh Rawat, said efforts to clear the tunnel had continued through the night.   About 80 metres of mud and rock had been taken out, but there was still another 100 metres to go to reach the workers.  ""It is possible that about 35 people are stuck inside,"" Rawat said.

The three countries have held multiple rounds of talks since Ethiopia broke ground on the project in 2011 but they have so far failed to produce an agreement on the filling and operation of the vast reservoir behind the 145-metre (475-foot) tall dam.  The last discussions, held by video-conference in early November, broke up without making any headway.  Late last month, Egypt called in Ethiopia's charge d'affaires after its foreign ministry spokesman claimed the dam dispute had become a welcome distraction from domestic problems for the Cairo government.  Sudan's state news agency SUNA said that officials from current African Union chair South Africa would be involved in the new round of talks.  Citing an unnamed official, SUNA said Sudan would propose granting African Union experts a ""bigger role"" in the negotiations for a binding agreement on the dam's filling and operation.   The European Union, among the observers of the Nile dam talks, welcomed the upcoming talks in a statement saying they offer ""an important opportunity for progress"" toward a deal.   The EU also urged ""all the parties to show the political will to engage in this round of talks in a constructive and open minded spirit"".  Cairo has expressed fears that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam will severely reduce the Nile's flow, with devastating effects for the more than 97 million Egyptians dependent on it.  Ethiopia says the hydroelectric power produced at the dam is vital to meet the power needs of its even larger population.  It insists downstream countries' water supplies will not be affected.   Sudan, which suffered deadly floods last summer when the Blue Nile reached its highest level since records began more than a century ago, hopes that the new dam will help regulate the river's flow.  The Blue Nile, which meets the White Nile in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, provides the great majority of the combined Nile's flow through northern Sudan and Egypt to the Mediterranean.  mz/hkb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84030880']

Her son, Kyle Johnson, announced the death on the official uhura.com website, saying, ""Last night, my mother, Nichelle Nichols, succumbed to natural causes and passed away. Her light, however, like the ancient galaxies now being seen for the first time, will remain.""  A family spokesman said Nichols died in Silver City, New Mexico, where she had been living with her son.  Tributes poured in quickly, including from a long list of devoted ""Trekkies.""  William Shatner, who played the USS Enterprise's Captain James T. Kirk, sent his condolences to Nichols' family.  ""She was a beautiful woman & played an admirable character that did so much for redefining social issues both here in the US & throughout the world. I will certainly miss her.""    George Takei, who as helmsman Sulu shared the bridge with Lieutenant Uhura, called her ""trailblazing and incomparable.""  And US President Joe Biden said Nichols ""redefined what is possible for Black Americans and women.""   ""Our nation is forever indebted to inspiring artists like Nichelle Nichols, who show us a future where unity, dignity, and respect are cornerstones of every society,"" he said in a statement.   Nichols made history with one of the first interracial kisses on US television -- a 1968 embrace shared with Shatner (a kiss deemed worthy of a separate entry in Wikipedia).  Martin Luther King Jr. himself once praised Nichols, who broke ground with her powerful performance at a time when Black actors more often were cast as servants or criminals.  - 'An equal role' -    Nichols, who had trained in ballet and musical theater, at one point told ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry that she wanted to quit the show to return to the theater.  But when she mentioned that to King, in a chance meeting recounted by the Hollywood Reporter: ""All the smile came off his face and he said, 'You can't do that. Don't you understand, for the first time, we're seen as we should be seen? You don't have a Black role. You have an equal role.'""  She stayed.  Nichols worked as a recruiter for NASA -- which reached out to her after she had criticized its lack of diversity -- and successfully encouraged several talented African-Americans and women of all races to consider careers with the space agency.   NASA paid tribute to her legacy in a tweet Sunday evening, calling her a ""trailblazer and role model"" who ""symbolized to so many what was possible.""  The National Air and Space Museum also praised her work beyond the screen.  ""She was an inspiration to many, not just for her groundbreaking work on Star Trek but also through her work with NASA to recruit women and people of color to apply to become astronauts,"" the museum tweeted.  While best known as Uhura, Nichols had a varied career, dancing with Sammy Davis Jr. in ""Porgy and Bess,"" appearing on the NBC series ""Heroes"" and recording an album.    She also played Uhura -- a name taken from the Swahili for ""freedom"" -- in the first six ""Star Trek"" movies.  The Smithsonian, the US national museum network, shared a picture on Twitter of the red space jacket Nichols wore as Uhura on screen, adorned with the iconic ""Star Trek"" pin, which is now on display at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.  bbk/bfm/caw/ssy   KING DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96016136']

It is a fresh blow for the beleaguered US aviation giant that was forced to ground another fleet of planes after a series of deadly crashes.  Boeing said Monday that 128 of it 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney engines will stop flying after the fire Saturday that forced the United Airlines plane to make an emergency landing.   ""I have just had confirmation that all the 777s equipped with this engine have been grounded,"" a spokeswoman for the planemaker told AFP in a text message.   Flight UA328 had been headed from Denver to Honolulu when it experienced engine failure shortly after departure.   A video shot from inside the plane -- which had 231 passengers and 10 crew on board -- showed the right engine ablaze and wobbling on the wing of the Boeing 777-200.  Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community.  Its front cowling, which landed in the front yard of a house, was entirely missing as the aircraft returned to Denver airport.  There were no injuries on the plane or on the ground, authorities said.    - Stepped-up inspections -    The US Federal Aviation Administration had ordered extra inspections of some passenger jets after the incident.    Steve Dickson, the head of the regulator, said he had consulted with experts, signalling the planes would likely be removed from the air.   ""I have directed them to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines,"" he said in a statement.  Dickson added that a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades, which were unique to the engine model and only used on 777 planes.   Officials from the FAA met with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives on Sunday evening, he added.  The US National Transportation and Safety Board also said it is investigating the incident, while United Airlines, Asiana, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways grounded their planes earlier.     Japan's transport ministry had earlier said it had ordered stricter inspections of the engine after a Japan Airlines 777 plane flying from Haneda to Naha experienced trouble with ""an engine in the same family"" in December.  Asiana Airlines, South Korea's second-largest carrier, had also said it would not fly any of its seven currently operational 777s.   - Fresh blow for Boeing -    The engine failure is unwelcome news for Boeing following several high-profile accidents.  The manufacturer's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after 346 people died in two crashes -- the 2019 Lion Air disaster in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash the following year.  Investigators said a main cause of both crashes was a faulty flight handling system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.  Boeing was forced to revamp the system and implement new pilot training protocols.  This month the aircraft made its first commercial flight in Europe since the grounding, after the continent's air safety regulator EASA approved the return of the 737 MAX.  The FAA and Britain's Civil Aviation Authority have also cleared the aircraft for flying again.   The 737 MAX was a big hit with airlines, becoming Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft until its grounding, which has now been lifted.   After the Covid-19 crisis decimated demand, airlines cancelled hundreds of orders for the plane.  burs-jv/txw   BOEING    GOL LINHAS AERAS INTELIGENTES    UNITED TECHNOLOGIES    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Hundreds of police in riot gear lined the streets of the capital from the early hours of Sunday morning, restricting movements of pedestrians around the centre.   In a rare move, Moscow city authorities also closed several central Metro stations and diverted overground transport.  Opposition supporters had called for a second weekend of demonstrations after tens of thousands protested across the country last Saturday over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent.   With protests beginning in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, independent monitor OVD-Info said at least 650 people had so far been detained across the country. It reported more than 4,000 detentions during last weekend's protests.  Navalny was detained at Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning he blames on the Kremlin.  The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a Moscow detention centre and facing years of potential jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.    - 'People are outraged' -    On Sunday protesters rallied in cities including Vladivostok in the Far East, where several dozen gathered in a central square despite police closing it off ahead of the rally.   Several thousand were also reported to have protested in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk despite temperatures dropping to -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).  Local politician and Navalny ally Helga Pirogova told AFP that Sunday's protest in Novosibirsk was potentially bigger than the week before.  ""People are still outraged by what is happening,"" the 32-year-old said.  In Moscow organisers were scrambling to deal with the massive police effort, announcing last-minute changes in locations as AFP journalists saw police starting to detain people.   Hundreds were marching through the centre chanting ""Freedom!"" and ""Putin is a thief!""  In second city Saint Petersburg police closed off the main thoroughfare Nevsky Prospekt and police cars were parked all across the centre, an AFP journalist reported.   ""The whole centre is cordoned off,"" said Natalya Grigoryeva, who came to the Saint Petersburg rally with her daughter. ""And who is this all against, against their own people?""  Russian authorities have issued several warnings against participating in the unauthorised rallies and threatened criminal charges against protesters.  Navalny is due in court in several cases next week, including on February 2 on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.   His wife Yulia posted a picture of her family on Instagram on Sunday, urging supporters to make their voices heard.  ""If we remain silent, then tomorrow they will come for any one of us,"" she wrote.     - Allies in custody -    This week several Navalny associates, including lawyer Lyubov Sobol and his brother Oleg, were placed under house arrest until late March pending charges for violating coronavirus restrictions by calling people to join protests.  Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh was detained late Saturday also over violating virus measures, the same day she was due to walk free after a nine-day jail term for violating protest laws.   The head of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, Ivan Zhdanov, said Saturday the Investigative Committee informed him that a criminal case on fraud charges had been launched against Navalny.   In December last year, investigators said they were initiating a probe into Navalny allegedly misappropriating over $4 million of donations to his organisations.   Days after Navalny was taken into custody, his team released a video report alleging Putin had been gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast, garnering over 100 million views on YouTube.  The Kremlin has denied that the Russian president owns the opulent complex, which according to Navalny features an underground ice hockey arena, a private casino and vineyards.  Billionaire businessman Arkady Rotenberg -- Putin's former judo partner who is under Western sanctions -- said Saturday he was the owner of the property and that he was building a hotel there.   acl/mm/bp   GOOGLE",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

But celebrations were marred by the death of a young man who drowned after jumping into the city's river near the parade. Zurich police said rescuers tried to save the man but it was too late.  Around 850,000 people attended the last event in 2019, and this year organisers expected between 750,000 and one million.  Under a clear blue sky, fans gathered for the start of the free parade for around two kilometres (1.4 miles) along the river in the heart of Switzerland's financial capital.  As the temperature reached 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit), the river's banks were full of revellers, many taking the plunge into the water to keep cool.  ""I don't have the right words to describe the atmosphere here, it is fantastic, all the people you know they are so eager to party,"" said Patrick, a 26-year-old Master's student in Zurich, with multi-coloured flowers and glasses on his head.  ""You can feel that, you can feel the vibration in the air,"" he added.  The highlight of the event is 30 floats known as ""lovemobiles"", which are usually brightly decorated trucks with music, DJs and party-goers.  More than 200 DJs will play at this year's event including international stars Adriatique, Anna Tur, Ida Engberg, Reinier Zonneveld and Syreeta.  After two years marked by the pandemic, the organisers said the parade's motto was ""THINK"".  ""Thoughts are the key to a peaceful coexistence of our cultures, no matter what religion, skin colour, origin or sexual orientation people belong to,"" organisers said.  The first edition of Street Parade took place in 1992, drawing a mere 1,000 revellers and only two lovemobiles.

The special rapporteurs insisted such harassment must stop, and said residents continue to be threatened by the risk of forcible transfer, including mass forced evictions and arbitrary displacement.  ""Israeli authorities' hubris is proving without limits. They are even harassing human rights defenders and humanitarian workers seeking to support and protect people facing grave human rights violations in Masafer Yatta,"" the four experts said in a joint statement.  ""This is a direct assault on the core of human rights and international humanitarian law... this also confirms that impunity over abuse of power fosters power to abuse.""  The case of Masafer Yatta -- or Firing Zone 918 -- an agricultural area near Hebron, has been one of Israel's longest running legal battles.   In the early 1980s, the army declared the 30-square-kilometre (12-square-mile) territory a restricted military area and claimed it was uninhabited.  Residents of eight villages had been in court for around 20 years fighting Israeli government efforts to evict them.  But in May this year, Israel's High Court approved the eviction of Palestinian villagers to make way for a military training zone.  ""The tragic implications of that decision are now before our eyes: roughly 1,200 Palestinian residents in Masafer Yatta are left defenceless in front of the threat of forced eviction and arbitrary displacement,"" said the experts, who do not speak for the United Nations but are mandated to report their findings to it.  The statement was penned by a special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory as well as rapporteurs on internally displaced persons, adequate housing, and the situation of human rights defenders.  They voiced dismay at reports that human rights defenders and humanitarian workers have been harassed by the Israeli military in Masafer Yatta.  ""They have been stopped and detained for several hours at checkpoints and had their identification documents or cars confiscated, often on grounds that they had entered a closed military site without permission,"" their statement said.  The experts expressed particular concern for Sami Hureini, a prominent human rights defender and member of the ""Youth of Sumud"" activist group ""engaged in peaceful resistance against illegal settlements in the southern Hebron hills"".  On June 28, he was reportedly arrested at a checkpoint in Masafer Yatta and detained by the military for several hours, the experts said.  ""He is currently being tried in the Ofer Military Court for allegedly obstructing and assaulting a soldier and entering a closed military zone, following his participation in a peaceful demonstration on 8 January 2021,"" they said.  Hureini's attorney, Riham Nasra, said her legal team has presented ""hundreds of photos and videos"" to disprove the allegations against her client.  ""Five activists who were near Sami during the protest testified that at no point did Sami resort to violence,"" Nasra told AFP in a statement.  The Israeli military and the country's foreign ministry did not immediately comment on the remarks by the UN experts.  The Israeli army told AFP that Hureini had been ""charged for his participation in a violent demonstration against soldiers and inciting other demonstrators to violence against the security forces"".  apo/rsc/gw/ah",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

While most global energy giants have quit operating in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, TotalEnergies has kept its lucrative natural gas operations in the country, though it has vowed to wind down purchases of Russian oil.  In particular it owns 49 percent of Terneftegaz, a company that extracts gas from the Termokarstovoye field, according to its 2021 annual report.  The other 51 percent is held by Russian company Novatek, in which the French firm also owns a direct 19.4 percent stake.  Le Monde reported this week that Termokarstovoye is a source of natural gas condensates -- a liquid hydrocarbon recovered when extracting the gas itself -- that are sent by pipeline to a Novatek processing plant in Purovsky.  They are then sent by rail for further refining into jet fuel in the southern Siberian city of Omsk, which in recent months has been sent to Russian airbases near the Ukrainian border, Le Monde said, citing data from financial information firm Refinitiv.  Squadrons based there have been accused by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of attacks on civilians, including the March 16 bombing of a Mariupol theatre where hundreds of people are believed to have died in what Amnesty described as a ""war crime"".  TotalEnergies has contested the claims, but France's Transport Minister Clement Beaune called Thursday for an inquiry ""to shed all the light"" on ""an extremely serious matter.""  On Friday, it said Novatek had confirmed that all gas condensates produced by the Terneftegaz venture was sent to a processing site called Ust-Luga near Leningrad.  ""The range of products derived during processing at the Ust-Luga Complex includes jet fuel (Jet A-1) that is exclusively exported outside Russia, and it does not even have the certification to be sold inside the country,"" according to a Novatek statement provided by Total.  ""Therefore, it is clear that the media publications and calls to investigate activities of TotalEnergies in our joint companies have absolutely no basis in fact,"" Novatek said.  TotalEnergies also said it was considering legal action in a bid to end an ""unfounded controversy which is damaging the reputation of the company.""  Chief executive Patrick Pouyanne had said in March that Russian gas fields exploited by the company's joint ventures ""are going to operate whether I leave or not"" and are vital for supplying energy to Europe.  The EU has imposed a ban on most Russian oil imports and a coal embargo in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but it has avoided sanctions on gas as the bloc is highly reliant on Russian supplies.  But Moscow has sharply reduced gas exports to Europe in response to punishing Western sanctions, prompting a huge spike in prices as winter approaches.  cho/js/lth   TOTALENERGIES    NOVATEK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Here are some facts and figures about the vote:    - Four presidential candidates -    From an initial shortlist of 17, four candidates were cleared to run for president, the smallest number since multiparty democracy began in the early 1990s.  The incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta has served two terms and cannot run again.   Raila Odinga, 77, is the veteran opposition leader now backed by longtime rival Kenyatta and is running under the Azimio la Umoja (Quest for Unity)-One Kenya Coalition.   The former prime minister has lost four previous shots at the presidency in 1997, 2007, 2013 and 2017.  William Ruto, 55, served as a lawmaker and agriculture minister before becoming deputy president in 2013. The ambitious rags-to-riches politician is running for the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) pledging to fight for ""hustlers"" trying to make ends meet.     George Wajackoyah, 63, a Nairobi street kid turned eccentric lawyer and former spy, is running for the Rastafarian-inspired Roots Party, campaigning on a pledge to legalise marijuana and export hyena testicles and snake venom to China.  David Mwaure, 65, is a senior lawyer and ordained minister running on the Agano (Swahili for ""covenant"" or ""promise"") Party ticket.       - 22.1 million voters -     About 22.1 million voters are registered out of a population of around 50 million. Nearly 40 percent of the voters, or 8.8 million, are aged between 18 and 34, a drop since the last poll.  A total of 46,229 polling stations will be open from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm (0300 GMT to 1400 GMT).   Election of the president, for a five-year term, is by direct popular vote. The winner needs 50 percent plus one vote and at least a quarter of the votes in 24 of the 47 counties.  Kenyans will also choose 47 county governors, 47 senators, 47 woman representatives, 290 members of parliament and 1,450 county assembly members.  There are a total of 16,100 candidates.  One of the costliest polls in the region, parliament has approved a 40.9-billion-shilling ($347-million) budget for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).   The African Union, the European Union and the Commonwealth are among those that have sent observers to monitor the polls.    - Biometrics and indelible ink -     At the polling station, the voter's identity is checked biometrically using an electronic system that scans their fingerprint.   Each voter receives six ballot papers, each a different colour, for each of the six different elections.  Before they leave, indelible ink is applied to the voter's finger to ensure they cannot vote again.  Manual registers are to be used as back-up if the electronic system fails but it remains a source of dispute between the rival candidates.  More than 1,100 polling stations have no access to 3G or 4G networks with the electoral body saying it will use satellite modems to ensure coverage.    - 150,000 officers -    About 150,000 officers will be deployed to ensure the safety of the polls, police chief Hilary Mutyambai said.  Polling day has been declared a public holiday, schools have been ordered closed until Wednesday, and supermarkets have urged people to stock up.  Politically driven ethnic violence broke out after the 2007 poll, killing over 1,100 people.  In 2017, dozens of people were killed. Their deaths were blamed on police brutality following the chaos and acrimony that followed the elections.    - After the polls -    Results are due to be announced no later than August 16.   Any second-round run-off, which would be a first in Kenya's history, must then be held within 30 days.  If no candidate files a challenge to the results with the Supreme Court, the winner takes office two weeks after final results are announced.   But if the court orders an annulment, a new vote must be held within 60 days.  In a historic decision in 2017, the court declared Kenyatta's win null and void after a petition by his rival Odinga because of widespread ""irregularities and illegalities"" in the counting process and mismanagement by the IEBC.  The incumbent went on to win the rematch after an opposition boycott.  ho/txw/imm","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

Its residents -- tested by repeated wars -- feel like they are living the same scenes again and again.  Before Israel launched its ""pre-emptive"" strikes on militants in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory was enjoying a summer unlike any other in recent years.   Gaza's beaches, long deemed too polluted with waste water for swimmers, had been declared mostly usable again, allowing Palestinians swimmers and surfers to rediscover the joys of the sea.   All that came to an abrupt halt on Friday when Israel again bombarded the territory, citing threats from Islamic Jihad militants.  ""We were living in peace and suddenly the bombardment began,"" said 40-year-old Mohammed Hamami.  ""Enough! Enough!"" he exclaimed. ""Each month or each year there is a war.""  There have been four conflicts since 2007 between Israel and armed groups from Gaza.  The beach promenade, one of the impoverished and overcrowded territory's rare leisure spots, crowded less than 24 hours earlier, was desolate on Saturday.  Street vendors stayed home and cafes were closed.   Fifteen months after the last conflict between Israel and armed groups in the territory brought devastation to countless Gazans, Hamami said he was ""surprised"" that Israel had attacked again.  Twice in July Israeli jets had struck Gaza after what the military said was rocket and rifle fire from the territory. But this time the military said it was preparing for a week-long operation.  The Jewish state has blockaded Gaza since 2007, the year Hamas Islamists took power in the territory.     - 'Fear, anxiety' -    Israel's army said its latest campaign was targeting militant sites and fighters, estimating that 15 combatants had been killed.   Palestinian militants retaliated with rocket fire.  The Hamas-run health ministry has reported 13 deaths from Israeli fire including a five-year-old girl, Alaa Kaddum. Her father carried her at her funeral, with a wound on her forehead and a pink bow in her hair.   More than 110 other people have been wounded, the ministry said.   For Gazans, the long night and second day of Israeli strikes stirred familiar and unwelcome emotions.   ""This latest escalation brings back images of fear, anxiety, and the feeling that we are all alone,"" said Dounia Ismail, a Gaza City resident.  The incessant explosions and air strikes had kept her up all night, she said.  ""It has become a habit for Palestinians in Gaza to prepare a survival bag, which contains a few important things, like photos, documents and some money and medicine,"" in case they have to flee their homes, said Ismail.   ""I hope this escalation won't turn into a bigger conflict and I hope the Egyptian mediation will restore calm.""   In Jabalia, in Gaza's north, Fouad Farajallah inspected what remained of his home, hit by an Israeli strike on Friday.  The living room had turned into a mass of sheet metal and rubble, the fan dangling from the ceiling.  ""I was sitting here on the sofa, with my wife and children, and suddenly it all fell on us,"" he said.   ""My wife broke her hand and my son was wounded by shrapnel.""   Even when silence appears to return between bombardments, something else fills the air: the buzzing of Israeli drones.  sa-yz/bs/rsc/it",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Hollywood's acting union nominated Boseman for his lead role as an ambitious young horn player in 1920s blues drama ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" and his supporting role as a Vietnam War soldier in Spike Lee's ""Da 5 Bloods.""  Both films also scored nominations for best cast -- the top prize at the SAG ceremony, which like much of the Tinseltown awards calendar has been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.  Although less high-profile than the Golden Globes nominations a day earlier, the SAG awards are seen as a stronger indicator of Oscars glory, since actors represent the largest branch of the roughly 10,000 Oscar voters in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.   Only two actors have ever posthumously won Oscars -- Peter Finch for 1976's ""Network,"" and Heath Ledger for 2008's ""The Dark Knight.""  Boseman died at age 43 in August last year from colon cancer, a diagnosis he never publicly discussed.  Boseman's co-star Viola Davis also earned a lead actress nod for ""Ma Rainey,"" putting it in a tie atop the SAG film acting nominations with Korean-American drama ""Minari.""  ""Minari,"" which follows an immigrant family who move to 1980s rural Arkansas to scrape together a new life, is hoping to emulate ""Parasite"" -- which won last year's SAG best cast prize before ultimately being named the Oscars best picture.  Former ""Walking Dead"" favorite Steven Yeun and veteran South Korean star Youn Yuh-jung were both recognized for the film, along with the ensemble cast.  Rounding out the prestigious best cast category were a pair of 1960s-set civil rights movies: ""One Night in Miami"" and courtroom drama ""The Trial of the Chicago 7.""  Netflix again dominated the film nominations with 13, while rival streamer Amazon followed with four.    - Trump row -    Former US president Donald Trump threatened to overshadow the morning's announcement with an angry letter resigning from the Hollywood union, which had recently launched disciplinary action against him.  In the letter published on Thursday, the former star of reality TV show ""The Apprentice"" dismissed SAG's threat to expel him with the words: ""Who cares!""  ""I no longer wish to be associated with your union... You have done nothing for me,"" wrote Trump, whose screen credits include ""Home Alone 2"" and ""Zoolander.""  SAG-AFTRA offered a succinct reply: ""Thank you.""  The union had voted last month to find ""probable cause of a violation"" by Trump in connection with the January 6 mob attack on the US Capitol.  It instructed a committee to investigate those events and Trump's mistreatment of broadcast journalists -- whom the 160,000-member union also represents.  Also among the ranks of SAG members are Hollywood's stunt workers, who receive their only major awards recognition at the annual SAG ceremony.  ""Da 5 Bloods"" and ""Chicago 7"" landed stunt nominations Thursday, alongside Disney's ""Mulan,"" Tom Hanks-starring western ""News of the World,"" and superhero movie ""Wonder Woman 1984.""  On the television side, ""The Crown"" and ""Schitt's Creek"" followed a strong showing at the Globes by topping the SAG nominations with five apiece.  The SAGs nominated several TV shows overlooked by the Globes, including Netflix mega-hit ""Bridgerton"" and acclaimed British drama ""I May Destroy You.""  The nominations were announced on Instagram Live by Daveed Diggs -- who earned a television acting nod for the Disney+ version of Broadway hit ""Hamilton"" -- and Lily Collins (""Emily in Paris"").   The 27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards were twice postponed, first by the pandemic and later by a clash with music's Grammys.

""We don't care what army you have, we only care about our land,"" Zelensky said in a defiant morning video address. ""We will fight for it until the end.""  Referring to Russia -- which launched a large-scale attack in the early hours of February 24 -- he vowed Ukraine ""will not try to find an understanding with terrorists"".  ""For us Ukraine is the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. ""All 25 regions, without any concession or compromise.""  Meanwhile on Wednesday, the US is set to announce $3 billion in fresh military aid to Kyiv on the date it severed ties with the Soviet Union in 1991.  The new tranche of American funding will help Kyiv acquire more weaponry, ammunition and other supplies for its armed forces, locked in a grinding war of attrition with Russian troops in the east and south with neither side advancing significantly in weeks.  The planned White House announcement comes as Washington warned Moscow could be planning a surge in strikes on civilian targets coinciding with Independence Day observations.  Gatherings have been banned in the capital Kyiv, where air raid sirens sounded in the morning, and Zelensky has urged citizens to be on guard against ""Russian terror"".    - Global support -    As the war entered its seventh month with no end in sight, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged unlimited assistance to Ukraine.  ""People are fighting with steel, with courage to defend their homes and their families, and to preserve their right to decide their own destiny in their own country,"" he said in a video message on Wednesday morning.  ""However long it takes, the United Kingdom will stand with Ukraine and provide every possible military, economic and humanitarian support.""  On Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned Russia against further attempts to annex Ukrainian territory in the same way it did the Crimean peninsula in 2014.  Polish President Andrzej Duda also advised against any ""appeasement"", saying: ""There is no return to business as usual in relations with Russia.""  And French President Emmanuel Macron vowed European Union support for Ukraine would continue ""for the long term"".  In an absurd message on Wednesday, the authoritarian leader of Belarus -- which offered its territory as a staging ground for Russia's invasion -- gave congratulations to Ukraine on its Independence Day.  ""I am convinced that today's contradictions will not be able to destroy the centuries-old foundation of sincere good neighbourly ties between the peoples of our two countries,"" Alexander Lukashenko said in a statement.    - Muted anniversary -    In the early days and weeks of Russia's invasion, Kyiv was under siege by Russian troops which reached the suburbs of the capital.  Moscow's offensive quickly faltered, and its forces withdrew in late March to regroup for assaults on Ukraine's east and south.  But in the capital, Ukrainians were sombre about the anniversary after a half-year of death and destruction.  ""Six months, the peace of life has been broken in every family,"" Nina Mikhailovna, an 80-year-old pensioner, said at Independence Square in central Kyiv, on Tuesday.  ""How much destruction, how many dead, how can we relate to it?"" she asked.  Kyiv's city administration said it would shut public service centres on Wednesday and Thursday, and shopping malls said they would close for the anniversary for safety concerns.     - Threatened nuclear plant -    Meanwhile, discussions continued on how to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, occupied by Russian troops and threatened by shelling, which Moscow blames on Kyiv.  The two sides traded accusations at a Tuesday meeting of the UN Security Council on Zaporizhzhia, with Ukraine and its allies demanding Russia pull its troops out of the plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- and agree to a demilitarised zone.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke on Tuesday by telephone to French counterpart Catherine Colonna about an expected visit to the plant by inspectors from UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), amid worries over the high risk of a radiation accident.  IAEA head Rafael Grossi issued a statement on Tuesday deploring weekend shelling at the site, saying further damage had been caused.  ""I'm continuing to consult very actively and intensively with all parties so that this vital IAEA mission can take place without further delay,"" he said.  It would ""help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation at the site and reduce the risk of a severe nuclear accident in Europe"".  bur-jts/raz",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

A furious Beijing kicked off its biggest-ever exercises around Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit this week to the self-ruled island.  Ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting in Phnom Penh warned against ""provocative action"".  The situation ""could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers"", the ministers said in a joint statement published Thursday.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is attending the talks along with his US counterpart Antony Blinken, though they are not expected to hold a one-on-one meeting.  At a meeting with ASEAN ministers, Blinken said the United States had contacted China ""at every level of government"" in recent days to call for calm and stability.  ""I hope very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretext to increase its aggressive military activity,"" Blinken said.  ""We and countries around the world believe that escalation serves no one and could have unintended consequences that serve no one's interests including ASEAN members and including China.""  But Wang, speaking on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit Thursday, said the ""flagrant provocation"" by United States had set an ""egregious precedent.""   ""If it's not corrected and countered, will the principle of non-interference in internal affairs still exist? Will the international law still be upheld? How can the regional peace be safeguarded?"" he said, according to Chinese state media Xinhua.  Beijing, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory to one day be reclaimed, by force if necessary, was enraged by the trip by Pelosi -- the highest-profile elected US official to visit the island in 25 years.  It vowed ""punishment"" and state TV said it began military drills, including live-fire exercises, at 0400 GMT in several areas encircling Taiwan.  Late Thursday, Japan's foreign minister Hayashi called for an ""immediate stop"" to the exercises.  ""China's actions this time have a serious impact on the peace and stability of the region and the international community. I once again demand the immediate stop of these military exercises,"" Hayashi told reporters.  His comments came after the Japanese defence minister said five Chinese ballistic missiles fired during the exercises were ""believed to have landed within Japan's (exclusive economic zone)"".   EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, also in Phnom Penh, condemned the Chinese response.  ""There is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait. It is normal and routine for legislators from our countries to travel internationally,"" he tweeted.  Kung Phoak, Cambodia's deputy foreign minister and ASEAN spokesman, urged both sides to stabilise the situation.   ""We hope de-escalation happens... and normalcy returns to the Taiwan Strait,"" he told reporters.    - 'Miscalculation' fear -    ASEAN is split between countries with close ties to China, such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, and others that are more wary of Beijing and its growing international assertiveness.   But no ASEAN country formally recognises Taiwan and none has shown an appetite for backing Taipei against China.  The ministers' statement -- which avoided referring to Taiwan by name -- said ASEAN ""stands ready to play a constructive role in facilitating peaceful dialogue"", though it is not clear either side is interested in outside mediation.  While Wang and Blinken are not scheduled to meet bilaterally, they will both attend a meeting Friday of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a 27-member body set up to discuss security issues that also includes Russia and the EU.  Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who will also join the ARF gathering, said the fragile status quo in the Taiwan Strait must be maintained.  ""All parties should consider how they can contribute to de-escalating current tensions,"" Wong told AFP.  ""One of the risks the region is concerned about is the risk of miscalculation.""  Pelosi's visit and the flare-up over Taiwan have overshadowed the ASEAN meeting, which had been due to focus on the violent political crisis in Myanmar.  ASEAN has spearheaded so far fruitless diplomatic efforts to ease the turmoil that has flowed from last year's military coup.  Several members are growing increasingly angry at the junta's stonewalling tactics.  bur-pdw-rbu/wd/st",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113435201']

Biden marked the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday with a trip from his home in Delaware to pack food bags for charity in Philadelphia -- a gesture symbolizing his call for Americans to come together after four divisive years.  ""Service is a fitting way to start to heal, unite, and rebuild this country we love,"" Biden said in a video marking the occasion.  But the 78-year-old Democrat's fervent appeals for optimism and healing -- which are also set to dominate his inauguration ceremony at noon on Wednesday -- are running up against the hard reality of multiple crises.  Covid-19 is out of control, vaccine distribution is stumbling, and economic recovery remains in the balance.  The United States' rocky transition of power was underlined Monday when Biden's spokeswoman quickly dismissed Trump's announcement that a Covid-19 ban on travelers arriving from much of Europe and Brazil would be lifted later this month.  Trump had refused for more than two months to accept the results of November's presidential election, and the country is seething with division and anger.  When Biden takes the oath of office at noon on Wednesday, he will face a city under the protection of more than 20,000 National Guard soldiers.  Checkpoints and large zones closed to ordinary citizens mean there will be only a smattering of guests. Similar lockdowns have been imposed at state capitol buildings around the country where local authorities fear provocations from right-wing groups ahead of the inauguration.  The acting defense secretary said that the military and FBI was vetting the National Guard troopers, who carry automatic weapons, in case any of them posed a threat.  ""While we have no intelligence indicating an insider threat, we are leaving no stone unturned in securing the capital,"" the official, Christopher Miller, said.  In a culturally significant mark, the legendary country singer Garth Brooks said that he was joining the musical line up at Biden's ceremony, stressing this was ""not a political statement, this is a statement of unity.""  Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez are already set to perform.    - Trump mulls pardons -    Trump, who has still not congratulated Biden or invited him for the traditional tea visit in the Oval Office, has been largely out of the public eye since his supporters rampaged through Congress on January 6, triggering his historic second impeachment a week later.  His final Gallup poll as president on Monday showed him exiting with 34 percent approval, his record low.  According to US media, one of Trump's final actions could be announced Tuesday at the latest: scores of pardons for convicted criminals.  Speculation is mounting over whether Trump will take the unprecedented and legally murky step of issuing himself and his children, who work as campaign and White House advisors, preemptive pardons.  According to CNN and other outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he will grant clemency.  After what The New York Times reports has been an intense lobbying effort, these are expected to be a mix of white collar criminals and people whose cases have been championed by criminal justice activists.  More controversial possible pardons that have been the subject of speculation for months would be for the likes of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Trump's influential advisor Stephen Bannon.  If Trump gave himself or his children a pardon -- something currently not expected -- that would ensure a politically explosive finale to one of the most polarizing presidencies in US history.  A self pardon might also harden anger at Trump among Republicans in the Senate, which is expected to start an impeachment trial soon.  When Trump announced that the US would lift Covid-19 travel bans on Europe and Brazil starting from January 26, Biden's spokeswoman shot back saying the ban would stay -- the latest twist in the chaotic end of Trump's time in office.    - Inauguration snub -    Trump, the first president to lose reelection since George H.W. Bush was replaced by Bill Clinton, is skipping Biden's inauguration -- the first ex-president to snub his successor in a century and a half.  On Wednesday, he'll travel to his Mar-a-Lago golf club residence in Florida, departing the White House early in order to benefit from full presidential travel privileges up to the last minute.  Marine One will take him from the White House to Joint Base Andrews to catch Air Force One -- the presidential plane that will no longer be his to use from noon.

Biden instructed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) earlier this month to take action to end the controversial ""Remain in Mexico"" program put in place by his predecessor Donald Trump.    It saw tens of thousands of non-Mexican asylum seekers -- mostly from Central America -- sent back over the border pending the outcome of their asylum applications, creating a humanitarian crisis in the area, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.   ""Beginning on February 19, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will begin phase one of a program to restore safe and orderly processing at the southwest border,"" the agency announced in a statement.  It said there are approximately 25,000 active cases still. Candidates will be tested first for the coronavirus, a senior DHS official who asked not to be identified told reporters.  At least 70,000 people were returned to Mexico under the agreement from January 2019, when the program began to be implemented, through December 2020, according to the NGO American Immigration Council.  US authorities emphasized that they are working closely with the Mexican government and with international organizations and NGOs at the border.    DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas, who is the first Latino and the first immigrant to head the department, stressed that Washington is committed to ""rebuilding a safe, orderly and humane immigration system.""    ""This latest action is another step in our commitment to reform immigration policies that do not align with our nation's values,"" Mayorkas said in a statement.    The program was part of Trump's hardline plan to fight illegal immigration, one of the hallmarks of his administration and which included efforts to build a border wall and the policy which separated children from thousands of migrant families.  After Biden took office on January 20, his administration announced that it would reverse the most controversial measures and created a task force to reunite families that remain separated, a policy his administration has termed a ""national shame.""     On the day Biden was inaugurated, the DHS announced the suspension of new registrations in the ""Remain in Mexico"" program and asked all those enrolled to stay where they are while waiting to be informed about their cases.   Washington said Friday that those waiting ""should not approach the border until instructed to do so.""   In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, at his press briefing, welcomed Biden's move.  Lopez Obrador said he hoped to discuss with Biden a work visa program for Mexicans and Central Americans.  ""Their presence as workers in the United States"" is vital to the US economy, Lopez Obrador said.  Migrants in Mexico hoping to reach the US welcomed the policy change in Washington.  ""With this news our miracle is on the verge of becoming reality,"" said Nicol Bueso, a 19-year-old Honduran who has been living in a shelter in Ciudad Juarez on the US border for a year and a half.  ""I am very happy because in all this time we have been here waiting we have had many unpleasant experiences,"" she said.  Jose Madrid, a 40-year-old Honduran, thanked the Biden administration.  ""Life is very hard in Central America and we are grateful to the president for making that decision and helping Central America,"" said Madrid, who has been in Ciudad Juarez for nearly two years.  an/gm-mdl/dw/jh",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105493039']

""The irrationality of thinking in this case is off the charts,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.   ""This can only be viewed extremely negatively.   ""Any attempt to isolate Russians or Russia is a process that has no prospects,"" Peskov added.  Irrespective of their political stance, Russians should ""live in their own world until they change their philosophy,"" Zelensky told the Post.   His remarks stand in stark contrast to the first days of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine when Zelensky used to reach out to Russia-based Kremlin critics, in Russian.

Japarov scooped more than 80 percent of the vote in Sunday's election in ex-Soviet Kyrgyzstan, with a similar proportion backing reforms in a simultaneous referendum that will grant him sweeping powers.  Speaking to supporters in Bishkek's central square -- the site of revolutions in 2005 and 2010 as well as unrest last year that helped propel Japarov to power -- he said opponents were ""scaremongering"" in their depictions of him as a hardliner.  ""There will be no dictatorship as some scaremongers say. There will be a dictatorship of law and justice,"" he said, borrowing a phrase from Russian leader Vladimir Putin, whose country is a key ally for Kyrgyzstan.  ""We have waited for this moment for 30 years,"" Japarov told supporters feasting on pilau and  bread at a concert of traditional music.  Monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said on Monday the election had lacked ""a level playing field"" as Japarov's well-funded campaign dominated those of his rivals' campaigns.  However, the organisation said the election and the parallel referendum were ""generally well organised"".    - Vote-buying down -    The 52-year-old had been serving jail time on hostage-taking charges until October, when his supporters freed him during mass protests.  He always described the conviction, which has now been overturned by a judge, as politically motivated.   The referendum result indicating a preference for presidential rule, as championed by Japarov, spells the end for a mixed constitution adopted a decade ago to tame authoritarianism, after two successive strongman presidents were ejected from power.  One Japarov supporter in the hundreds-strong crowd at the concert told AFP that he believed the vote winner was ""pure in his heart, thoughts and words"".  ""We see that he is ready to fight for the country,"" said Jakshylyk Saparaliyev, 45.   While Japarov has inspired his supporters during his rapid rise to power, turnout at the elections was less than 40 percent.   Political analyst Azim Azimov told AFP that he believed this was partly a result of less vote-buying, which he said happened on an ""industrial scale"" during the parliamentary vote which sparked a political crisis in October.   Former president Sooronbay Jeenbekov became the third Kyrgyz leader to resign in political chaos, as supporters freed their hero from prison the night after the vote and powered him to the top of the political pyramid.   With its threadbare economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Kyrgyzstan's next leader is likely to be even more dependent on Russia -- a destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrants -- and neighbouring economic giant China.  Putin was among the first leaders to congratulate Japarov on his victory, noting that further cooperation between the two countries ""meets the fundamental interests of our friendly peoples"" in a telegram Monday.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104045825']"

Drawing a curtain on the most tumultuous administration of modern times, Trump is being ousted by a polar opposite with the Democrat Biden intent on charting a new course to tackle Covid-19 and unite a splintered nation.  A small crowd waved goodbye as Trump, 74, and First Lady Melania Trump walked a short red carpet and boarded the Marine One helicopter shortly after 8:15 am (1315 GMT), for the short flight to the air base where they will continue to Florida on board Air Force One.   ""I just want to say goodbye,"" Trump told the gathering, calling his time in office ""the honor of a lifetime.""  Trump will be at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when Biden, a 78-year-old former vice president, is sworn in at noon on the US Capitol's western front.  Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office at the very spot where pro-Trump rioters clashed with police two weeks ago before storming Congress in a deadly insurrection.  While a transition of power will occur much as it has for more than two centuries, this inauguration is unlike any other.  Official Washington has taken on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat of this month's attack.  And with the pandemic raging, the general public is essentially barred from attending the swearing-in, leading to the unprecedented sight of an empty National Mall on Inauguration Day.  With the death toll soaring past 400,000, Biden on Tuesday led a powerful tribute to victims of Covid-19 as he arrived in Washington.  ""It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" Biden said in somber remarks in front of the Lincoln Memorial, once more stressing the need to unite the country after Trump's chaos.    - Trump snub -    On the Mall's grassy expanse, some 200,000 flags have been planted to represent the absent crowds at the inauguration.  Trump broke days of silence Tuesday with a pre-recorded farewell video address in which -- for the first time -- he asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming administration.  But Trump has yet to personally congratulate Biden, who first ran for president in 1987, on his win, and the 11th-hour message followed months spent persuading his Republican followers that Democrat cheated his way to election victory.  In one of his last acts before departing the White House, Trump issued scores of pardons to people convicted of crimes or facing charges, including several key allies.  Influential former Trump aide Steve Bannon -- charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall, a flagship Trump policy -- was among 73 people on a list released by the White House.  However, neither Trump nor his relatives were listed, amid speculation he could use the legally dubious tactic of a preemptive pardon to fend off future charges.  Former Trump fund-raiser Elliott Broidy was similarly pardoned, after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws.  The rapper Lil Wayne, who last month pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, and faced 10 years in jail, also made the list.  Tensions have soared on Capitol Hill, where the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.  The spectacle will clash with the opening days of Biden's tenure, as the new president seeks to swiftly confirm his Cabinet picks and push through ambitious legislation -- including a $1.9 trillion rescue package.    - 'I'll get right to work' -    ""We don't have a second to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face as a nation,"" Biden tweeted late Tuesday.  ""That's why after being sworn in tomorrow, I'll get right to work.""  He plans to kick off his tenure by rejoining the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, according to aides, who said Biden would sign 17 orders and actions just hours after being sworn in, setting new paths on immigration, the environment, Covid-19 and the economy.  In first-day moves, he will end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.  To symbolize the new spirit of unity, Biden has invited the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell -- and other congressional leaders to attend a church service with him Wednesday before the inauguration.  Overseas leaders weighed in to mark the end of a presidency which has deviated from orthodox American foreign policy.  Iran's President Hassan Rouhani hailed the White House departure of ""tyrant"" Trump, saying ""the ball is in America's court"" to return to a landmark nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Tehran.  And Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the inauguration would ""be a demonstration of the resilience of American democracy,"" as well as ""the resounding proof that, once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House.""  bur-ec/dw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Leonid Volkov, the head of the opposition politician's regional network, called on Twitter for Russians across the country to take to the streets on Sunday ""for Navalny's freedom, for freedom for all, and for justice"".  Russian police on Saturday detained more than 3,500 people, a record for a single day, at rallies in over 100 cities across the country where demonstrators were calling for Navalny's release and protesting the government.  The 44-year-old anti-graft campaigner was detained earlier this month on his arrival to Moscow from Germany, where he had been recovering following a poisoning attack with the Novichok nerve agent.  His team spurred on his call for the rallies last weekend by releasing an investigation into a lavish property on Russia's Black Sea coast that Navalny alleged is owned by President Vladimir Putin.  The Russian leader on Monday denied ownership of the sprawling mansion, saying: ""Nothing that is listed there as my property belongs to me or my close relatives, and never did.""  Volkov called on Russians to rally again to put pressure on the authorities to release Navalny before he is due in court on February 2 on charges of breaking the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.  The Kremlin critic could be jailed for more than three years if the court rules in favour of Russia's prison service, which says Navalny failed to check in with it twice per month while he was recovering in Germany.

Six children were among those killed in the latest ""Israeli aggression"" since Friday, and 265 people have been wounded, said health authorities in the Islamist-run enclave where several buildings were reduced to rubble.  The fighting is the worst in Gaza since a war last year devastated the impoverished coastal territory, home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, and forced Israelis to seek shelter from rockets.  Israel pressed on with its aerial and artillery bombardment of positions of Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed group designated as a terrorist organisation by several Western nations, as the group has fired over 500 rockets in return.   The Israeli army has said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"", and Prime Minister Yair Lapid vowed Sunday that ""the operation will continue as long as necessary"".  In Gaza, run by the Islamist group Hamas -- who said Sunday they were ""united"" with Islamic Jihad, but have not joined the fray -- the ministry said 31 people had died since the start of Israel's ""Operation Breaking Dawn"".  Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Saturday.  It was not immediately clear how many children were killed there, but an AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the local hospital, including three minors.  ""We were sitting in the street and suddenly we saw an explosion,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children.""    - Leaders targeted -    The army said it had struck 139 Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing 470 rockets that had crossed into Israel, while another 115 rockets fired from Gaza fell inside the enclave.  Al Quds Brigades, the Islamic Jihad's military wing, said it had ""fired rockets"" at Jerusalem, where sirens wailed and explosions were heard as the army shot them down.  In total, Israel said its Iron Dome air defence system had intercepted some 185 rockets, with a success rate of 97 percent of projectiles targeted.  Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem meanwhile marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount, where some Palestinians shouted ""God is greatest"" in response.  Tensions there have previously sparked wider violence -- with Hamas's Doha-based chief Ismail Haniyeh warning of the risk of an ""uncontrollable"" security crisis.  An AFP photographer was briefly detained by Israeli police, amid a heavy security deployment, but wider commemorations passed off without major incident.  Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, as the group was planning an imminent attack.  ""Whoever seeks to hurt Israeli citizens will be hurt,"" said Defence Minister Benny Gantz.  Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said Cairo was talking with both sides ""around the clock"" to ease the violence, but Gantz said strikes would continue ""until we restore quiet and remove the threats"".  Israel's army has reported killing senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south, as well as the arrest of 20 members in the West Bank.  Israel's Lapid called the killing of Mansour an ""extraordinary achievement"".    - 'We are all alone' -    Daily life in the Gaza strip has come to a standstill, with the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said the next few hours will be ""crucial and difficult"", warning that without electricity it soon risked suspending vital services.  In Gaza City, resident Dounia Ismail said the Israeli bombardment ""brings back images of fear, anxiety and the feeling that we are all alone"".  Civilians in southern and central Israel, meanwhile, were forced into air raid shelters, with two people hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others lightly hurt while running for safety, the Magen David Adom emergency service said.  ""It's tense, it's frightening,"" said Beverly Jamil, a resident of Ashkelon close to Gaza, who has been rushing repeatedly to her air raid shelter.  ""Ashkelon's a ghost town -- it's a holiday, kids should be out playing.""  Meanwhile, the response of Hamas to the violence remains critical, with spokesman Fawzi Barhoum offering the group's support to Islamic Jihad on Sunday, but stopping short of saying they would take part.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.  ""The resistance in all its military wings and factions are united in this battle,"" Barhoum said.  bur-pjm/fz",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The country's top prosecutor did not reveal the reason for the unprecedented search of the home of a former US president, and condemned ""unfounded attacks"" on the FBI and the Justice Department that followed it.  ""I personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant,"" Garland told reporters in his first public statement since Monday's raid. ""The department does not take such a decision lightly.""  While noting that ""ethical obligations"" prevented him detailing the basis of the raid, Garland said he had asked a Florida judge to unseal the warrant because Trump had publicly confirmed the search and there is ""substantial public interest in this matter.""  Trump, who has a copy of the search warrant but has -- so far -- declined to reveal its contents, has until 3:00 pm (1900 GMT) on Friday to contest the request that it be unsealed.  Some analysts suggested Garland was effectively daring him to block the motion, given that Trump has insisted the raid was baseless and politically motivated.  Andrew Weissmann, a former Justice Department official, said Garland had ""called Trump's bluff"" by putting the onus on the former president to object or consent to release of the document.   The Justice Department motion to unseal the warrant noted -- and did not dispute -- statements by Trump's representatives that the FBI was seeking presidential records and potential classified material.  According to US media, the search related to potential mishandling of classified documents taken to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left the White House in January 2021.  The Washington Post on Thursday cited anonymous sources close to the investigation as saying that classified documents relating to nuclear weapons were among the papers sought by the FBI agents during the raid.  The newspaper did not clarify if the nuclear weapons involved belonged to the United States or to another country.    - Political firestorm -    The FBI raid on Trump's palatial Mar-a-Lago residence sparked a political firestorm in an already bitterly divided country, and comes as he is weighing another White House run in 2024.  In a statement on his Truth Social platform on Thursday, Trump said his attorneys had been ""cooperating fully"" and ""the government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it.""  ""And then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided at 6:30 in the morning,"" he said, adding that agents even ""went through the First Lady's closets and rummaged through her clothing and personal items.""  Leading Republicans have rallied around Trump, and some members of his party have harshly denounced the Justice Department and FBI, accusing them of partisanship in targeting the former president.  Garland criticized what he called ""unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department agents and prosecutors.""  An armed man was shot dead by police on Thursday after trying to break into an FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio, police said.    - 'Without fear or favor' -    The Justice Department typically does not confirm or deny whether it is investigating someone, and Garland -- a former prosecutor and judge who has a reputation as a stickler for protocol -- took pains to emphasize the law was being applied fairly.  ""Faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy,"" he said. ""The rule of law means applying the law evenly without fear or favor.""  Since leaving office, Trump has remained the country's most divisive figure and a force in the Republican party, continuing to sow falsehoods that he actually won the 2020 vote.  On Wednesday, the 76-year-old former president was questioned for four hours by Letitia James, the New York state attorney general who is investigating the business practices of the Trump Organization.  Trump is also facing legal scrutiny for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and over the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.  Trump was impeached for a historic second time by the House after the Capitol riot -- he was charged with inciting an insurrection -- but was acquitted by the Senate.  cl/st/to",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Several prominent pro-Bolsonaro businessmen including billionaire department store mogul Luciano Hang were targeted by federal police raids Tuesday after a media report said they had discussed a potential coup if the far-right president does not win in Brazil's October elections.  Bolsonaro said authorities had improperly targeted and nearly jailed the eight businessmen, calling the investigation a bid to muzzle his supporters.  ""Brazil is on the road to dictatorship. This is how dictatorships start now. You lose (your freedom) little by little, then one day you look and you're completely tied up,"" he told radio network Jovem Pan.  Hang, the owner of retail chain Havan and a vocal Bolsonaro backer with millions of followers on social media, accused the authorities of censorship, saying his Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok accounts had been blocked.  ""They can take away my social networks, but they'll never shut me up!"" said Hang, who has an estimated fortune of $4.8 billion, according to Forbes, built on an empire of department stores known for displaying giant replicas of the Statue of Liberty out front.  ""Say no to censorship! You could be next,"" he posted Thursday on his Twitter account -- which was blocked for users in Brazil.  News site Metropoles reported last week that a WhatsApp messenger group including Hang and other business leaders had ""openly defended a coup"" if Bolsonaro loses to leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party (PT), who leads in the polls.  The report cited leaked messages in which group members said they ""prefer a coup to the return of the PT"" and that ""the victims' blood will become the blood of heroes.""  Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes, the new head of Brazil's top electoral tribunal and a frequent target of Bolsonaro's attacks, directed federal police to execute search warrants reportedly targeting several of the businessmen.

A live feed from Russian space agency Roscosmos showed the launch of the Soyuz-2.1b rocket carrying the Khayyam satellite from the Russia-controlled Baikonur cosmodrome at the scheduled time of 0552 GMT.  The Russian mission control confirmed its subsequent entry into orbit.   Iran, which has maintained ties with Moscow and refrained from criticism of the Ukraine invasion, has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to spy on Ukraine.  Last week, US daily The Washington Post quoted anonymous Western intelligence officials as saying that Russia ""plans to use the satellite for several months or longer"" to assist its war efforts before allowing Iran to take control.  But the Iranian Space Agency said on Sunday that the Islamic republic would control the Khayyam satellite ""from day one"".  ""No third country is able to access the information"" sent by the satellite due to its ""encrypted algorithm,"" it said.  The purpose of Khayyam is to ""monitor the country's borders"", enhance agricultural productivity and monitor water resources and natural disasters, the space agency said.  In a pre-launch statement on Monday ISA praised ""the high reliability factor of the Soyuz launcher"".  ""Due to Khayyam satellite's weight of more than half a ton and the very high success rate of the Soyuz launcher, the launch of the Khayyam satellite has been entrusted to Russia,"" the statement on the space agency's website noted.   As Moscow's international isolation grows under the weight of Western sanctions over Ukraine, the Kremlin is seeking to pivot Russia towards the Middle East, Asia and Africa and find new clients for the country's embattled space programme.  Russian President Vladimir Putin met Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran last month -- one of his few trips abroad since the invasion began.   - 'Long-term cooperation' -    Khayyam, apparently named after the 11th-century Persian polymath Omar Khayyam, will not be the first Iranian satellite that Russia has put into space -- in 2005, Iran's Sina-1 satellite was deployed from Russia's Plesetsk cosmodrome.  Iran is currently negotiating with world powers, including Moscow, to salvage a 2015 deal aimed at reining in Tehran's nuclear ambitions.  The United States -- which quit the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA under then-president Donald Trump in 2018 -- has accused Iran of effectively supporting Russia's war against Ukraine while adopting a ""veil of neutrality"".   During his meeting with Putin last month, Iran's Khamenei called for ""long-term cooperation"" with Russia, and Tehran has refused to join international condemnation of Moscow's invasion of its pro-Western neighbour.  Iran insists its space programme is for civilian and defence purposes only, and does not breach the 2015 nuclear deal, or any other international agreement.   Western governments worry that satellite launch systems incorporate technologies interchangeable with those used in ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, something Iran has always denied wanting to build.  Iran successfully put its first military satellite into orbit in April 2020, drawing a sharp rebuke from the United States.  cr-bur/ach",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

The Arakan Army (AA) has for nearly two years been locked in battle with Myanmar's powerful military, fighting for more autonomy for the state's ethnic Rakhine population.    Both sides stand accused of rights abuses, with hundreds killed or injured and some 200,000 civilians forced to flee their homes in an area under a strict lockdown -- making independent reporting all but impossible.  In October -- weeks before an election that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was expected to win nationwide -- gunmen descended on a campaign event in Taunggok township in southern Rakhine and abducted three MP candidates.  Accusing the NLD of ""collaborating and covering up war crimes committed by the Myanmar Army"", the AA said the aspiring legislators would be freed only if those ""detained unlawfully"" by the government and the army were released.  On Friday,  ""after discussions"", the trio were freed along with three soldiers also held by the AA, the army -- known in Burmese as the Tatmadaw -- said in a statement.   ""This afternoon, AA handed them to the Tatmadaw team on duty... and they were safely taken by army helicopter to (Rakhine state's capital) Sittwe,"" the statement read.  The militant group confirmed the release, adding that the three NLD members were kidnapped ""for the purpose of war, politics and revolution"".   It also called for scores of Rakhine politicians and civilians -- including AA members -- to be freed.  ""As we've released (the NLD members), we are demanding... for AA members who have been arrested to be released in return for peace,"" the group said.   The western state has long been a hotbed of conflict.  Since the AA stepped up attacks on the military in 2018, Rakhine civilians and village chiefs suspected of being involved have been arrested, while family members of prominent AA figures were also detained.  Ahead of the November poll, the election commission said security concerns meant the vote would be cancelled across swathes of the country, including much of Rakhine.   The move incited fury from a minority group which has long felt marginalised by the country's ethnic Bamar majority, and also raised questions about the vote's credibility.  As expected, Suu Kyi's ruling party swept the election in a landslide win.   But in Taunggok township, where the three abducted candidates were supposed to stand, the Arakan National Party -- a hardline nationalist party for ethnic Rakhine -- took victory.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105367670']

Asked at his confirmation hearing by Senator Ted Cruz if the United States will continue its stance on Jerusalem and maintain its embassy, Blinken said without hesitation, ""Yes and yes.""  Trump in 2017 bucked international consensus and recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, despite Palestinians' claims to the holy city as part of their campaign for a separate state.  Blinken indicated that Biden would try harder to pursue a separate Palestinian state but acknowledged the difficulties.  ""The only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,"" Blinken said.  But he added: ""I think realistically it's hard to see near-term prospects for moving forward on that.""  ""What would be important is to make sure that neither party takes steps that make the already difficult process even more challenging,"" he said.  Shortly after his remarks, a watchdog said that Israel had issued tenders for 2,500 new settler homes.  Outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo disputed that Israeli settlements on Palestinian land were illegal and visited one such site on a November trip to the West Bank.  The Trump administration had voiced general support for a Palestinian state but said it should be demilitarized and not have its capital inside Jerusalem.  The Palestinian leadership boycotted Trump, saying the Jerusalem move as well as his ending of aid for Palestinian refugees showed his bias.  In a drive led by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump instead focused Middle East efforts on winning Arab recognition of Israel with four nations agreeing to normalize ties since September.  Blinken also said he opposed campaigns to pressure Israel through boycotts, putting him at odds with some in the left wing of his Democratic Party.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The number of bombings across Afghanistan has declined since the Taliban returned to power last year, but several attacks -- some targeting minority communities -- have rocked the country in recent months, including those claimed by the jihadist Islamic State (IS) group.  No group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday evening's blast at Kabul's Sediqia Mosque, which has an adjoining madrasa.  ""He was my cousin, may God forgive him,"" said one local resident who gave his name as Masiullah, referring to a relative who died in the explosion.  ""One year had passed from his marriage, he was 27 years old... he was a good person.""  Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran said 21 people were killed and 33 others wounded.  Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said it had received 35 patients, including three who died.  ""Most of the injuries were caused by shrapnel and burns. Our surgeons were operating throughout the night. There were nine children among the victims that we received,"" country director Stefano Sozza said in a statement on Thursday.   Local hospitals contacted by AFP said they were not permitted to provide details of casualties they had treated.  The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan on Thursday said security was ""deteriorating"" in the country.   ""We deplore yesterday's attack in a Kabul mosque, the latest in a disturbing series of bombings which have killed & injured more than 250 people in recent weeks, the highest monthly number of civilian casualties over the last year,"" said a statement released on Twitter.  - Security challenge -    Taliban officials insist they have full control of security and frequently deny or play down incidents reported on Afghanistan's vibrant social media.  They have also taken recently to preventing local and foreign media from covering the aftermath of attacks -- sometimes using violence -- and on Thursday armed Taliban fighters blocked journalists from reaching the latest blast site.  Wednesday's explosion comes nearly a week after a suicide bomber killed top Taliban cleric Rahimullah Haqqani, along with his brother, at his madrasa in Kabul.  Haqqani was known for angry speeches against IS, which later claimed the attack.  The jihadist group has primarily targeted minority communities such as Shiites, Sufis and Sikhs.  The Taliban claim they have defeated IS, but experts say the group remains a key security challenge for the hardline Islamists.  While IS is a Sunni Islamist group like the Taliban, the two are bitter rivals and greatly diverge on ideological grounds.  Taliban leaders on Thursday led a major gathering of more than 2,000 clerics and elders in the southern city of Kandahar, the movement's de facto power base.  In a statement sent to the media, a Taliban spokesman said ""important decisions"" would be taken at the conference but provided no details.  The Taliban on Monday marked the first anniversary of their return to power following a turbulent year that saw women's rights crushed and a humanitarian crisis worsen.  Initially, they promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, but many restrictions have gradually been imposed.  Afghanistan is in economic crisis, with its overseas assets frozen by Washington and aid curtailed to keep funds out of the Taliban's hands.  No country has officially recognised the government.  ash/ecl/axn","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113550033', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113551461']"

Israel has said it was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, insisting the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the Gaza border.    Health authorities in Gaza, a Palestinian enclave controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said 10 people have been killed by Israel's bombardment, including a five-year-old girl, with 79 others injured. Israel's army estimated that its operation has killed 15 militants.   Early on Saturday Israel broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, a group that is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently.  The Israeli army announced the arrest of 19 people it said were members of the group in the occupied West Bank, alongside the arrest of one other person.   Israel and Islamic Jihad have both confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key leader of the militants, in a Friday strike on a building in the west of Gaza city.   Islamic Jihad said that initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"", before it unleashed a barrage of rockets towards Israel.  The rocket fire and Israeli strikes were continuing early Saturday, risking a repeat of an 11-day conflict in May 2021 that devastated Gaza and forced countless Israelis to rush to bomb shelters.    - Escalation, mediation -    ""Israel isn't interested in a wider conflict in Gaza, but will not shy away from one either,"" Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in a nationally televised address on Friday.   Air raid sirens sounded across southern Israel early Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage, with many rockets intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defence system.  Officials in border areas urged people to stay close to shelters, which have also been opened in the commercial capital of Tel Aviv.   Egypt, a historic broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, was seeking to mediate and may host an Islamic Jihad delegation later Saturday, Egyptian officials told AFP in Gaza.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.   A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor.  The sides exchanged fire for several days without Hamas joining the fray.  Hamas's moves amid the current violence could prove crucial in determining its severity, with the group facing pressure from some to maintain calm in order to improve economic conditions in the territory.  Gaza City resident Abdullah al-Arayshi said the situation was ""very tense"".   ""The country is ravaged. We've had enough of wars. Our generation has lost its future,"" he told AFP.  Streets were largely deserted in Gaza City early Saturday, with many shops shuttered, and daily life largely paralysed, an AFP reporter said.       - Five-year-old girl -    Fire balls and plumes of smoke have billowed out of targets hit in Gaza, but there were no reports of new casualties in recent hours.   On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among those killed.   Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.   The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel has conducted a near relentless wave of raids inside the West Bank since mid-March in response to deadly attacks on Israeli citizens.   Islamic Jihad did not launch rockets after Saadi's arrest, but Israel has insisted through the week that the group was committed to seeking revenge.     bur-bs/dwo",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- was severed Thursday from Ukraine's power network for the first time in its four-decade history due to ""actions of the invaders"", Energoatom said.  The operator said that as of 2:04 pm (1104 GMT) the plant ""is connected to the grid and produces electricity for the needs of Ukraine"" once again.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country's nuclear experts had managed to protect the plant ""from the worst case scenario which is constantly being provoked by Russian forces.""  But he added: ""I want to underline that the situation remains very risky and dangerous.""  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been cause for mounting concern since Russian troops seized it in early March.  In recent weeks, Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame for rocket strikes around the facility in the southern Ukrainian city of Energodar.  Separately Friday, the EU presidency vowed to hold an emergency summit on the spiralling energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, which this week entered its seventh month.  The bloc has vowed to wean its 27 member states off Russian oil and gas in protest against the invasion, which has led to tough international sanctions against Moscow.  Friday saw Norway, a major natural gas producer, say it was joining the latest package of EU sanctions.  However, anxiety over supply has sent prices soaring, with Germany and France reporting Friday record electricity prices for 2023, more than 10 times higher than for this year.  Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said his country, which holds the EU presidency, ""will convene an urgent meeting of energy ministers to discuss specific emergency measures"".    - Anxiety over plant -    Zelensky said late Thursday the power cut-off was caused by Russian shelling of the last active power line linking the plant to the network.  ""Russia has put Ukrainians as well as all Europeans one step away from radiation disaster,"" he said.  Energoatom said the outage was caused by ash pit fires at an adjacent thermal power plant, which damaged a line connecting the only two of the plant's six reactors in operation.  Blaming Russian attacks for damage to the three other power lines linking the complex to the national grid, Energoatom said Friday afternoon one reactor had been reconnected ""and capacity is being added"".  International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Mariano Grossi said Thursday he wants to visit the site within days, warning of potential disaster.  Ukraine energy minister adviser Lana Zerkal said an IAEA inspection ""is planned for the next week"".  Zelensky said Friday that the team needs to get there as soon as possible ""and help maintain the station under Ukrainian control on a permanent basis.""  Zerkal told Ukraine's Radio NV late Thursday she was sceptical the mission would go ahead, despite Moscow's formal agreement, as ""they are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission will not reach the site"".    - US warning -    Kyiv suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russian troops in 2014.  On Thursday, Washington warned against any such move.  ""The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters, saying attempts to redirect power to occupied areas were ""unacceptable"".  Britain's defence ministry said satellite imagery showed an increased presence of Russian troops at the power plant with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60 metres (200 feet) of one reactor.  In another development Friday, French energy firm TotalEnergies said it was divesting its stake in a Russian gas field following a media report that some of its fuel was ending up in Russian fighter jets.  The company said it had signed a deal Friday with its local Russian partner Novatek to sell its 49 percent in the Termokarstovoye gas field ""on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field"".  It said the divestment had been agreed in July and Russian authorities gave the approval on August 25.  A day earlier, French daily Le Monde had reported the alleged refining of natural gas condensates from Termokarstovoye into jet fuel for fighter-bombers involved in Russia's assault on Ukraine.  TotalEnergies is the only major Western energy group to continue its operations in Russia but chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said in March Russian gas fields exploited by the company's joint ventures were vital for supplying energy to Europe.  bur-jts/cdw/raz/dw/bfm   TOTALENERGIES    NOVATEK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Standing on the steps of the US Capitol that was ransacked by pro-Trump mobs exactly two weeks earlier, Biden was sworn in moments after Kamala Harris took the oath as America's first woman vice president.  ""Democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,"" Biden said before a National Mall that was virtually empty due to the ultra-tight security and a raging Covid-19 pandemic that he vowed to confront immediately.  ""We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility and we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes,"" he said.  ""Together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear, of unity, not division, of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing and goodness.""  But Trump, who falsely said that he was cheated out of a second term and egged on his supporters before their rampage at the Capitol, broke 152 years of tradition by refusing to attend his successor's inauguration.  Biden pushed through a flurry of orders the moment he entered the White House, starting with rejoining the 2015 Paris climate accord, from which the United States was the sole outlier after a withdrawal by Trump, an ally of the fossil fuel industry.  ""We are going to combat climate change in a way we have not done so far,"" the new US leader said in the Oval Office as he signed papers to rejoin the Paris deal, which was negotiated by Barack Obama when Biden was his vice president.  Biden also halted the US exit from the World Health Organization, rescinded a ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority nations and halted construction of Trump's cherished wall on the Mexican border.    - 'President for all Americans' -    In his inaugural address, Biden appealed to supporters of Trump, who shattered political norms by ruthlessly belittling rivals, denouncing entire ethnic groups and trying to cast doubt on basic facts.  ""I will be a president for all Americans,"" the veteran Democrat said.  But Biden confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as evidenced during Trump's presidency by the Capitol mob, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants, and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.  The United States faces ""a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat,"" Biden said.  ""Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear and demonization have long torn us apart.""  At 78, Biden is the oldest-ever US president, a job he first sought in 1987. He is only the second Roman Catholic president after John F Kennedy and swore his oath on a bulging old family Bible.   Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history, and the first Black person and first person of Asian heritage as the nation's number two.   She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever ""second gentleman"" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who was seen luring the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers in a video that went viral.    - Empty Washington -    Central Washington took on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat of the January 6 violence.   With the public essentially barred from attending due to the pandemic, Biden's audience at the National Mall instead was 200,000 flags planted to represent the absent crowds.  Biden, who has vowed a major escalation in the nation's Covid vaccination drive, warned that the ""toughest and deadliest period"" was still ahead.   So far, more than 400,000 people have died of Covid in the United States, more than in any other country.  ""We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation,"" he said, striking a new tone after Trump's mockery of mask-wearing and business closings meant to halt the virus.  While the public crowds were gone, Biden brought in celebrity power -- absent four years ago with Trump.  Lady Gaga, in a dress with a black bodice and a billowing red skirt, sang the national anthem and Tom Hanks prepared to host a televised evening appearance with the new president.  Jennifer Lopez sang a pop rendition of ""This Land is Your Land,"" often considered the unofficial US national anthem, ending it by exclaiming the final words of the pledge of allegiance -- ""one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"" -- in Spanish.  The new first lady, Jill Biden, invited a 22-year-old poet, Amanda Gorman, who became a star of the day with verse on how democracy ""can never be permanently defeated.""  Biden and Harris started their administration by jointly paying respects to fallen soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery followed by an inaugural parade -- devoid of the usual crowds -- that featured both an Army fife and drum corps in the red coats of George Washington's time, and a drumline and dancers from Howard University, the historically Black institution that counts the new vice president as a graduate.    - Trump vows to be back -    Trump left Washington hours before the inauguration, walking on a red carpet on the White House lawn with his wife Melania into the Marine One presidential helicopter, which flew near the inauguration-ready Capitol before heading to Andrews Air Force Base.  ""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters at a campaign-style event with cannons before leaving for his Florida resort in his last trip on Air Force One.  ""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.  In a first hint of graciousness, Trump wished the next administration ""great luck and great success"" -- without saying Biden's name.  Biden said that Trump left him a traditional letter that was ""very generous"" but declined to reveal the contents.  Mike Pence, the outgoing vice president who clashed with Trump in his final days by acknowledging he could not overturn the election, attended the inauguration and was spotted laughing with Harris.  Also taking part were former presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and their wives -- including Hillary Clinton, for whom Biden's victory was especially sweet four years after her narrow, surprise defeat to Trump.  In the middle of his last night at the White House, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 73 people including his former campaign chief Steve Bannon, who was charged with defrauding donors who thought they were building Trump's wall.  Trump in a final act lifted a ban on his administration's officials working as lobbyists -- an order he had issued at the start of his presidency as he vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington.  bur-sct/sst",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The lightning hit Lafayette Square, a small park across the street from the White House, shortly before 7:00 pm (2300 GMT) Thursday, leaving two men and two women with ""critical life-threatening injuries,"" according to a statement from Washington's fire and emergencies department.

The plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- was severed Thursday from Ukraine's power network for the first time in its four-decade history due to ""actions of the invaders"", Energoatom said.  The operator said that as of 2:04 pm (1104 GMT) the plant ""is connected to the grid and produces electricity for the needs of Ukraine"" once again.  French President Emmanuel Macron, on a visit to Algeria, warned ""civil nuclear power must be fully protected"" even in the event of war.  Separately Friday, the EU presidency vowed to hold an emergency summit on the spiralling energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, which this week entered its seventh month.  The bloc has vowed to wean its 27 member states off Russian oil and gas in protest against the invasion, which has led to tough international sanctions against Moscow.  Friday saw Norway, a major natural gas producer, say it was joining the latest package of EU sanctions.  However, anxiety over supply has sent prices soaring, with Germany and France reporting Friday record electricity prices for 2023, more than 10 times higher than for this year.  Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said his country, which holds the EU presidency, ""will convene an urgent meeting of energy ministers to discuss specific emergency measures"".    - Anxiety over plant -    The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been cause for mounting concern since Russian troops seized it in early March.  In recent weeks, Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame for rocket strikes around the facility in the southern Ukrainian city of Energodar.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Thursday the power cut-off was caused by Russian shelling of the last active power line linking the plant to the network.  ""Russia has put Ukrainians as well as all Europeans one step away from radiation disaster,"" he said.  Energoatom said the outage was caused by ash pit fires at an adjacent thermal power plant, which damaged a line connecting the only two of the plant's six reactors in operation.  Blaming Russian attacks for damage to the three other power lines linking the complex to the national grid, Energoatom said Friday afternoon one reactor had been reconnected ""and capacity is being added"".  International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Mariano Grossi said Thursday he wants to visit the site within days, warning of potential disaster.  Ukraine energy minister adviser Lana Zerkal said an IAEA inspection ""is planned for the next week"".  But Zerkal told Ukraine's Radio NV late Thursday she was sceptical the mission would go ahead, despite Moscow's formal agreement, as ""they are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission will not reach the site"".    - US warning -    Kyiv suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russian troops in 2014.  On Thursday, Washington warned against any such move.  ""The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters, saying attempts to redirect power to occupied areas was ""unacceptable"".  Britain's defence ministry said satellite imagery showed an increased presence of Russian troops at the power plant with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60 metres (200 feet) of one reactor.  In another development Friday, French energy firm TotalEnergies said it was divesting its stake in a Russian gas field following a media report that some of its fuel was ending up in Russian fighter jets.  The company said it had signed a deal Friday with its local Russian partner Novatek to sell its 49 percent in the Termokarstovoye gas field ""on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field"".  It said the divestment had been agreed in July and Russian authorities gave the approval on August 25.  A day earlier, French daily Le Monde had reported the alleged refining of natural gas condensates from Termokarstovoye into jet fuel for fighter-bombers involved in Russia's assault on Ukraine.  TotalEnergies is the only major Western energy group to continue its operations in Russia but chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said in March Russian gas fields exploited by the company's joint ventures were vital for supplying energy to Europe.  Also Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's office said he would visit Germany next week for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that are expected to focus on Europe's energy crisis.  Germany is hugely dependent on Russian gas and Scholz says an Iberian pipeline to central Europe could ease the supply crisis.  Currently Spain has just two low-capacity links to France's gas network, which has connections to the rest of Europe.  bur-jts/cdw/raz   TOTALENERGIES    NOVATEK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The initiative, which appears certain to fail, flies in the face of rulings in dozens of courts, and the findings by officials in several key states, that there were no widespread voting problems.   The Republicans' statement, signed by Cruz and six other current senators along with four senators-elect, asserts that ""allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.""  The group said that when Congress convenes in a joint session on Wednesday -- for what normally would be a pro-forma certification of Biden's victory -- they will demand the creation of a special commission to conduct ""an emergency 10-day audit"" of the election results.   The statement says individual states could then convene special legislative sessions and potentially revise their vote totals.  The 11 signees join Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who said earlier that he planned to raise objections on Wednesday.   A Republican member of the House of Representatives, Louie Gohmert, has also announced his plan to oppose certification, and more than 100 House Republicans reportedly will back his challenge.  Gohmert sought to further raise the stakes with a lawsuit that would have given Vice President Mike Pence -- traditionally in a ceremonial role in Wednesday's session -- the power to overturn the election result.  Pence opposed that effort, and a federal judge in Texas on Friday rejected the suit.  The Hawley and Gohmert challenges will ensure that Congress must meet to hear the complaints.   The Congress sessions, sure to be contentious, will play out against a backdrop of pro-Trump rallies in Washington next week encouraged by the president himself.   As with Trump's other attempts to reverse his election defeat, the latest political maneuvering appears doomed. Democrats control the House, and many Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday for certification.  The 11 senators conceded that most Democrats and ""more than a few Republicans"" would likely oppose their initiative.  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has urged fellow Republicans to vote to certify and avoid a divisive political brawl, saying, ""The Electoral College has spoken.""  Biden won in the all-important Electoral College by a vote of 306 to 232.  ""This is cynical, anti-democratic posturing,"" presidential historian Tim Naftali told CNN.   Cruz is considered a likely 2024 presidential candidate. Hawley is also said to be positioning himself for a 2024 run -- and so is Pence.  bbk/bgs","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

Leftist economist Arauz leads the field with 32.3 percent of the vote following Sunday's general election with over 80 percent of results declared, but indigenous rights activist Yaku Perez and right-wing ex-banker Guillermo Lasso are locked in a fierce battle to finish second.  Arauz told AFP he hoped victory in the April 11 run-off would ""build a project of national unity, in which we can have a greater level of self-criticism and invite the different segments of our society to unite on an emergency economic and health plan.""  The vote took place amid a backdrop of economic problems exacerbated by a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed 15,000 lives in Ecuador, and Sunday's polls were marred by long lines of people waiting to cast ballots as virus restrictions caused chaos.  After topping exit polls, Arauz, a protege of former president Rafael Correa, claimed a ""resounding victory in all regions of our beautiful country,"" although he urged supporters to wait for official results before celebrating.  The battle for second place has been full of twists.  Initial exit polls suggested Lasso would face Arauz in the run-off, only to be upended when an official projection by the country's National Electoral Council based on partial results pointed to Perez.  The gap between the two candidates has narrowed again, with Perez on 19.9 percent, and Lasso on 19.3 percent.  The country's 13.1 million voters are choosing a successor to unpopular socialist President Lenin Moreno and the 137 members of congress.  Strict health precautions appeared to slow voting and may have discouraged some from casting their ballots, as long lines stretched outside polling stations.  ""I hope that at last we will elect a president who is not corrupt, and that there are changes,"" Sebastian Amaguaya, 23, told AFP as he waited to vote.  The field had been congested, with 16 candidates, including Ximena Pena, the only woman.   To win outright, a candidate needs 50 percent plus one vote or 40 percent and a 10-point lead over the nearest rival.    - End to austerity? -    Arauz, 36, represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while lawyer Perez, 51, is from the left-wing Pachakutik party, and is the first indigenous candidate to get this far in the presidential race.  Arauz's mentor Correa -- a two-time president who currently lives in Belgium to evade a conviction for corruption -- remains a strong force in the country.  ""People have voted not in direct support to Arauz but because he is the Correa candidate,"" political scientist Karen Garzon Sherdek, from the International University SEK, told AFP.  ""Thank you dear Ecuador!"" Correa tweeted as the results came in. ""The Citizen Revolution has won overwhelmingly, despite a dirty campaign and 4 years of brutal persecution and infamy.""  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year, austerity-driven hiatus under Moreno.  However, he vowed to take a different approach to relations with the US to Correa, who aligned himself with socialist regimes in Venezuela and Bolivia.  ""Our relations with the United States will be excellent, especially now with the administration of President (Joe) Biden,"" said Arauz.  ""US progressives now have representation in the Democratic party and the Biden administration.""  Arauz has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.    - Under pressure -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno as the price of crude crashed.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, did not seek reelection. His four-year term will end on May 24.  sp-pld/vel/bc/bgs","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76763779', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84078919']"

The diplomats from the 27 nations are meeting in Brussels for a busy day of talks ranging from Europe's relations with new US President Joe Biden to efforts to salvage the Iran nuclear deal.   But the arrest of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic Navalny and detention of thousands of protesters will be one of the thorniest issues.    ""I think the EU needs to send a very clear and decisive message that this is not acceptable,"" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said as he arrived for the meeting.   European diplomats told AFP that ministers do not expect to agree on sanctions on Monday despite a push from some capitals to take a tough line.   Brussels is expected to hold off until Navalny goes to court in early February to see if the Kremlin puts him behind bars for an extended term.   The anti-corruption campaigner is facing three-and-a-half years in jail for breaching the conditions of an earlier suspended sentence while recovering in Germany from a near-fatal poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent.   His arrest on returning to Russia unleashed a wave of protests on Saturday that saw baton-wielding riot police detain more than 3,500 people.   While sanctions appear unlikely for now, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell will face pressure to abandon a trip to Moscow pencilled in for next month.   Borrell labelled the arrests a ""disproportionate use of force"" and wrote on Twitter that Monday's meeting would discuss the EU's ""next steps"".

The incoming administration has nominated Levine -- currently secretary of health in Pennsylvania -- to serve as assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human Services, Biden's transition office said.  ""Levine will bring the steady leadership and essential expertise we need to get people through this pandemic -- no matter their zip code, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability,"" Biden said in the statement.  ""She is a historic and deeply qualified choice to help lead our administration's health efforts.""  The biggest crisis facing Biden as he takes office is the coronavirus pandemic that has now sickened at least 24 million and killed 400,000 people in the US, making it the worst-hit country in the world.   The transition has already named California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as its nominee for Health and Human Services secretary.  Biden has said he wants to see 100 million people vaccinated during his first 100 days as president, and is seeking billions of dollars from Congress to fund mass vaccination centers.   Levine, a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Penn State College of Medicine, ""is poised to become the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the US Senate,"" according to the Biden team.  She would be the highest-ranking transgender official in the US government.   Cabinet-level and senior positions require confirmation by the Senate, which will be in the Democrats' hands after Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are sworn in Wednesday.  The Biden team statement pointed out that Levine has already been confirmed by the Republican-held Pennsylvania Senate three times in her current position.     - 'Most diverse in history' -    The Democrat was the first president-elect to thank transgender supporters during his November 7 victory speech in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.  ""And to all those who supported us: I am proud of the campaign we built and ran. I am proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse in history,"" he said.  ""Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Progressives, moderates and conservatives. Young and old. Urban, suburban and rural. Gay, straight, transgender. White. Latino. Asian. Native American.""  The incoming president's attitude stands in contrast to his predecessor, as the Trump administration has adopted several controversial policies in regards to transgender rights.   In a reversal from an Obama-era policy, the Trump administration in 2017 announced its plans to ban transgender people from serving in the military, claiming ""tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.""  By 2018, the Pentagon said it would allow trans people who had not undergone gender confirmation surgery -- nor intended to -- to serve under their gender assigned at birth.   Federal courts blocked that policy, but the administration appealed.   In January 2019, the Supreme Court ruled the government could enforce the ban pending further court reviews.   It is estimated there are between 1,300 and 15,000 transgender US military personnel, out of a force of 1.3 million active duty troops.  The Trump administration had also tried to block protections for transgender people at work, claiming the Civil Rights Act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex did not apply to sexual or gender minorities.  But the US Supreme Court ruled in June 2020 that transgender, gay and lesbian people were covered under the 1964 landmark legislation.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The British author of ""The Satanic Verses"", which sparked fury among some Muslims who believed it was blasphemous, had to be airlifted to hospital for emergency surgery following the attack.  His agent said in a statement obtained by The New York Times that ""the news is not good.""  ""Salman will likely lose one eye; the nerves in his arm were severed; and his liver was stabbed and damaged,"" said agent Andrew Wylie, who added that Rushdie could not speak.  Carl LeVan, an American University politics professor attending the literary event, told AFP that the assailant had rushed onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and ""stabbed him repeatedly and viciously.""  Several people ran to the stage and took the suspect to the ground before a trooper present at the event arrested him. A doctor in the audience administered medical care until emergency first responders arrived.  New York state police identified the suspected attacker as Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old from Fairfield, New Jersey, adding that he stabbed Rushdie in the neck as well as the abdomen.   The motive for the stabbing remains unclear.  An interviewer onstage, 73-year-old Ralph Henry Reese, suffered a facial injury but has been released from the hospital, police said.   The attack took place at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo city.  ""What many of us witnessed today was a violent expression of hate that shook us to our core,"" the Chautauqua Institution said in a statement.  LeVan, a Chautauqua regular, said the suspect ""was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued,"" adding that he believed the man ""was trying to kill"" Rushdie.  ""There were gasps of horror and panic from the crowd,"" the professor said.    - A decade in hiding -    Rushdie, 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" transformed his life when Iran's first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or religious decree, ordering his killing.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.  Conservative media in Iran hailed the attack on Rushdie, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor"".  Ultra-conservative newspaper Kayhan, whose chief is appointed by current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote: ""Bravo to this courageous and duty-conscious man who attacked the apostate and depraved Salman Rushdie in New York.""   Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practicing Muslims and identifies as an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head.  He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell his even his own children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.  Global leaders voiced anger over the attack on Rushdie, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying the author ""embodied freedom"" and that ""his battle is ours, a universal one.""  British leader Boris Johnson meanwhile said he was ""appalled,"" sending thoughts to Rushdie's loved ones and praising the author for ""exercising a right we should never cease to defend.""  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called it a ""reprehensible attack,"" adding that ""all of us in the Biden-Harris Administration are praying for his speedy recovery.""       - An 'essential voice' -    Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa and other threats failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"" -- which runs to more than 600 pages -- has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  ""Just hours before the attack, on Friday morning, Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face,"" Nossel said in a statement.   ""Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman, wishing him a full and speedy recovery.

At his confirmation hearing, Blinken said he would ""immediately"" review the outgoing Trump administration's labeling of the Iran-linked insurgents, fearing the move was worsening a humanitarian crisis.  ""At least on its surface, (the designation) seems to achieve nothing particularly practical in advancing the efforts against the Huthis and to bring them back to the negotiating table while making it even more difficult than it already is to provide humanitarian assistance to people who desperately need it,"" Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Donald Trump's administration announced the move on January 11, nine days before Biden takes over on Wednesday.  Trump has been a staunch ally of Saudi Arabia, offering US logistical help and military sales for its six-year campaign to dislodge the rebels who have taken over much of the neighbouring country.  Blinken said that the Saudis have ""contributed to what is by most accounts the worst humanitarian situation anywhere in the world"".  ""The Huthis bear significant responsibility for what's happened in Yemen, but the way the campaign has been conducted has also contributed significantly to that situation. And so our support should end,"" Blinken said.    - Warnings from Huthis -    The United Nations and aid groups have warned the terrorist designation risks worsening the plight of a country where millions depend on aid to survive.  The designation took effect Tuesday, with the Huthis warning they would respond to any action against them.  ""We are ready to take all necessary measures against any hostile act,"" they said in a statement.  The designation is expected to halt many transactions with Huthi authorities, including bank transfers and payments to medical personnel and for food and fuel, due to fears of US prosecution.  The US Department of the Treasury, however, has issued humanitarian exemptions under which it would be permissible for aid organisations to deal with the Huthis, according to its website.  The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, responsible for overseas sanctions, had ""issued four general licenses to facilitate the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian assistance and certain other critical commodities to the people of Yemen"".  Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, called on the United States to reverse the Trump administration's move.  ""Our position on this has not changed,"" Dujarric said. ""We call on the government to reverse that decision.""  ""Our concern from the beginning, that we expressed very clearly, is the impact on the commercial sector,"" he said.  ""The vast majority of food and other basic supplies that comes into Yemen comes in through the commercial sector.""  Outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in announcing the designation, pointed to an attack on the airport in Yemen's second city Aden in late December targeting the new Yemeni government that was blamed on the Huthis.  Blinken said the United States remained ""clear-eyed about the Huthis"".  ""They overthrew a government in Yemen, they engaged in a path of aggression through the country, they directed aggression toward Saudi Arabia and committed atrocities and human rights abuses,"" he said. ""And that is a fact.""  But he said that efforts by Pompeo to exempt aid groups were insufficient as they concerned US rather than international groups.  Aid groups fear that they will face legal problems in the United States by interacting with the Huthis, which they say is unavoidable as they are the de facto government in much of Yemen.  bur-sct-gw/hc",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

According to family members quoted by Russian media, Dugin -- a vocal supporter of Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine -- was the likely target of the blast as his daughter borrowed his car at the last minute.  Daria Dugina was killed when a bomb placed in the Toyota Land Cruiser went off as she drove on a highway near the village of Bolshie Vyzyomy, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside Moscow, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.  Dugina, a journalist born in 1992 who herself openly supported the offensive, died at the scene and a homicide investigation has been opened, said the committee, which probes major crime cases in Russia.  In July Britain put her on a list of sanctioned Russians for allegedly spreading online disinformation about Ukraine.  Dugin, 60, sometimes called ""Putin's Rasputin"" or ""Putin's brain,"" is an outspoken Russian ultranationalist intellectual.  He has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking territories in a vast new Russian empire and wholeheartedly supported Moscow's operation in Ukraine.

The only fatality tied to Wednesday's unrest was the woman, reportedly a dedicated Donald Trump backer and air force veteran who was among a throng of supporters of the president that invaded the US legislature.  Washington police chief Robert Contee said three other people, one woman and two men, had died Wednesday in the area around the Capitol, but did not link those deaths to the violence.  Each of the three ""appeared to have suffered medical emergencies which resulted in their deaths,"" Contee told reporters.  Contee said 52 people had been arrested Wednesday, 26 of them on the grounds of the Capitol, for curfew violations, unlawful entry and weapons charges.  Fourteen police were injured, one seriously after he was pulled into a crowd and assaulted, he added.  He also said two pipe bombs had been discovered near the Capitol, one at democratic Party offices and the other at Republican Party offices.  In addition, a vehicle was discovered parked on Capitol grounds with a long gun and Molotov cocktails inside.  Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser announced an extension of the city's state of emergency for 15 days through the January 20 presidential inauguration of Joe Biden, amid fears Trump and his supporters will continue to threaten violence over their unsupported claims that Biden's election win was fraudulent.  ""I know that I speak for all of us when I say that we saw an unprecedented attack on our American democracy incited by the United States president, and he must be held accountable,"" Bowser said.  Trump was blamed for the death of the woman, one of thousands of supporters he urged to descend on the Capitol after a midday rally at the White House in which he told them that he lost the November 3 election due to massive fraud.  They flocked to the Congress just as it opened a joint session to certify Biden as the election winner.    - Strong Trump supporter -    The dead woman was identified in US media as Ashli Babbitt, a backer of the president from San Diego, California who had served in the United States Air Force.  She was shot amid chaotic and violent scenes inside the Capitol building, where some security personnel drew their guns to protect lawmakers as protesters advanced.  ""She was a strong supporter of President Trump,"" San Diego TV station KUSI reported, citing the woman's husband.  Babbitt identified herself as a veteran on her Twitter account and noted her love for the US. She had recently retweeted messages in support of Trump and from those coming to Washington for Wednesday's rally.  ""Nothing will stop us....they can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!"", she wrote in a tweet on Tuesday.

Authorities have yet to say why the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 went into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport on Saturday afternoon.  But, on Sunday, they said that they had pinpointed the location of its black boxes -- cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- that could be key to explaining why the plane slammed into the Java Sea off the sprawling city's coast.  ""Divers will start looking for them now and hopefully it won't be long before we get them,"" said the head of Indonesia's transport safety agency, Soerjanto Tjahjono.  The search and rescue agency said it had collected body bags filled with human remains, as well as debris from the wreckage, in waters about 23 metres (75 feet) deep.  Passengers Ihsan Adhlan Hakim and his new bride Putri were headed to Pontianak, the city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island which had been flight SJ182's destination, about 90 minutes away.  ""He called me to say that the flight was delayed due to bad weather,"" Hakim's brother Arwin said from Pontianak, where a wedding celebration had been planned.  ""That was the last time I had contact with him.""    - Steep dive -    Beben Sofian, 59, and her husband Dan Razanah, 58, were also on the doomed flight.  ""They took a selfie and sent it to their kids before taking off,"" the couple's nephew, Hendra, told AFP.  DNA from relatives will be compared with discovered remains for identification.  All 62 passengers and crew aboard the half-full flight were Indonesian. The count included 10 children.  Distraught relatives waited nervously for news at Pontianak airport.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" said a sobbing Yaman Zai.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  Data from FlightRadar24 indicated that the airliner reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  The transport minister said Saturday that the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  ""The aircraft's final moments are... very concerning as the speed that (it) was flying at that altitude was much lower than expected,"" said Stephen Wright, professor of aircraft systems at Finland's Tampere University.  ""The last seconds saw the aircraft rapidly descend from 10,000 feet to the sea in a matter of 20 seconds, which implies a catastrophic event or something deliberate.""  But he added that the crash can ""only be fully explained once the black boxes and wreckage can be properly analysed"".  Sriwijaya Air, which operates flights to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said little so far about the 26-year-old plane, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.  The Indonesian carrier has not recorded a fatal crash since it started operations in 2003, but this accident is the latest in a string of disasters for the country's aviation sector.  The Southeast Asia nation's aviation sector has long been marred by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.    - Safety concerns -    In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.  That accident -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the accidents.  The 737 that went down Saturday was not a MAX variant.  ""Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families,"" Boeing said in a statement.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.  A final report said major factors included a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance, and the pilots' inadequate response.  A year later more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/fox/bfm/jm   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

Kamala Harris, the boundary-breaking new vice president, along with new first lady Jill Biden, both wore American designers, as did Biden and the second gentleman Doug Emhoff.  President Biden and Emhoff both went classic in America's legacy designer Ralph Lauren, with Biden in a lavender tie.  Lauren's designs are favorites of Washington politicians. He also dressed Melania Trump during her husband's 2017 inauguration, with the former first lady wearing a sky blue dress coat ensemble.  Biden's wife Jill arrived in a look from the small house Markarian, whose young designer Alexandra O'Neill crafted an ocean blue tweed dress with a hint of shimmer and a matching coat that featured dark blue lapels, with a coordinating mask and gloves.  The New York designer has dressed a number of stars, including Laura Dern and Lizzo, despite establishing her fashion house just four years ago.  ""It is an incredible honor to dress Dr. Biden today,"" O'Neill said to AFP. ""I am so humbled to be even a small part of American history.""

The assault on the Hayat Hotel triggered a fierce gunfight between security forces and gunmen from the jihadist group who are still holed up inside the building, security official Abdukadir Hassan told AFP.  The Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group, which has been waging a deadly insurgency against Somalia's fragile central government for about 15 years, claimed responsibility.  Ambulance officials gave an injury toll of three, while witnesses at the scene at an intersection known as KM4 reported another two had been wounded.  ""A huge blast went off a few minutes before the gunmen forced their way into the hotel,"" Hassan said.  ""We don't have the details so far but there are casualties, and the security forces are now engaging with the enemy who are holed up inside the building,"" he added.  Somali police spokesman Abdifatah Adan Hassan later told reporters that the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who attacked the hotel with several other gunmen.  The assailants ""are now being engaged by the police forces, they will be neutralised very soon"", he said.  It was not immediately clear if security forces had taken back control of the hotel and if the attack was over.  Witnesses said a second blast occurred outside the hotel just a few minutes after the first, inflicting casualties on rescuers and members of the security forces and civilians who rushed to the scene after the first explosion.  ""The area is cordoned off now and there is exchange of gunfire between the security forces and the gunmen,"" said one witness, Mohamed Salad.  The militants claimed the attack in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website.  ""A group of Al-Shabaab attackers forcibly entered Hotel Hayat in Mogadishu, the fighters are carrying out random shooting inside the hotel,"" the group said in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website.  The Hayat is a popular spot in Mogadishu in an area where several other hotels are located, and it is frequented by government officials and civilians.     - US air raids -    Earlier this week, the United States announced that its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab fighters in an air strike in the central-southern part of the country as the Islamist militants were attacking Somali forces.  The US has carried out several air raids on the militants in strikes in recent weeks.  In May, President Joe Biden ordered the reestablishment of a US troop presence in Somalia to help local authorities combat Al-Shabaab, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump to withdraw most US forces.  In recent weeks, Al-Shabaab fighters have also waged attacks on the Somalia-Ethiopia border, raising concerns about a possible new strategy by the Islamist militants.  Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said last month that ending Al-Shabaab's insurgency required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time is right.  Al-Shabaab fighters were driven out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force, but the group still controls swathes of countryside.  It continues to wage deadly strikes on civilian and military targets, with hotels a quite frequent target.  Earlier this month, Somalia's new Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre announced the appointment of the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow, 53, publicly defected from Al-Shabaab in August 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5-million bounty for his capture.  The Horn of Africa nation has been mired in chaos since the fall of the military regime of President Siad Barre in 1991.  His ouster was followed by a civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.  The deadliest attack in Somalia occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in a bustling commercial district of Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  nur/txw/ah",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

The raid was just the most recent episode in which the former US leader was accused of playing loose with and abusing classified information.    - Iranian missile site -    As president, Trump had the power to unilaterally declassify information. But some of his actions stunned the US intelligence community nonetheless.  On August 30, 2019 he tweeted what was believed to be a classified high-resolution image of an Iranian rocket launch site.  ""The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir [Space Launch Vehicle] Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,"" Trump tweeted.    - Israeli intelligence -    On May 10, 2017 Trump met Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the White House Oval Office.   In the meeting, Trump told the two Russians about intelligence the United States had received from a Middle East ally about an Islamic State plot.  The highly classified intelligence, it turned out, came from Israel, which was upset by the disclosure, according to media reports.    - Location of nuclear subs -    In April 2017 Trump told Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte that two US nuclear submarines were off the coast of North Korea, boasting of ""a lot of firepower,"" according to a Philippines transcript of their call.  The Pentagon only very rarely discloses the location of its submarines, which are crucial to the US strategic defense force.    - Secret nuclear weapons -    In a 2019 interview Trump told writer Bob Woodward about an unknown US nuclear capability that may have been a specious boast, or divulged highly secret information.  ""I have built a nuclear, a weapons system that nobody's ever had in this country before,"" Trump told Woodward.   ""We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before,"" he added.    - Details of Special Forces raid -    After a US operation killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria in October 2019, Trump, boasting of the attack, revealed numerous details that the Pentagon would normally withhold, like how many helicopters were involved, how the commandos entered the residence, and that the US had intelligence from Islamic State use of phones and the internet.   The information ""could contribute to a reverse engineering of our intelligence methods by the adversary,"" former special operations commander Michael Nagata told Politico.    - Secrecy with Putin -    Trump also withheld intelligence from his spy chiefs. In July 2018 Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, was visibly surprised at the Aspen Security Forum when the host told him the White House had tweeted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to visit Washington.  ""Say that again?"" Coats said.  Coats also said he was in the dark about what Trump discussed in a two-hour, one-on-one meeting with the wily Russian leader three days earlier.

Thousands of protesters defied government warnings to rally from Vladivostok to Saint Petersburg in a second weekend of mass demonstrations over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic.  Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning he blames on the Kremlin.  The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a Moscow detention centre and faces years of potential jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.  In moves not seen in years in Moscow, authorities locked down the centre of the capital Sunday, with hundreds of police lining the streets, central Metro stations closed and the movements of pedestrians restricted.  Protesters who had hoped to gather outside the headquarters of the FSB security service were instead scattered to various parts of the city as organisers made last-minute changes in locations.  AFP journalists saw dozens of protesters detained and taken into police vans. It was unclear amid the chaos how many people took part in the demonstration.   Independent monitor OVD-Info said at least 3,062 people had been detained across the country, including 844 in Moscow, and arrests were continuing. It reported more than 4,000 detentions during similar protests last Saturday.  The Russian Union of Journalists said around 35 people working for media outlets were also detained on Sunday.    - US condemns 'harsh tactics' -    US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Twitter condemned ""the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists by Russian authorities for a second week straight.""  The Russian foreign ministry hit back, accusing the United States of ""gross interference"" in its affairs and of using ""online platforms controlled by Washington"" to promote the protests.  Hundreds marched through the centre of Moscow chanting ""Freedom!"" and ""Putin is a thief!"" before arriving outside Matrosskaya Tishina prison where Navalny was being held.   Several dozen were detained at the prison, with police chasing down protesters in the snow outside the complex.   ""The people in power don't want to listen to anything or to anybody,"" 34-year-old vet Darya told AFP at the Moscow rally.  In the second city of Saint Petersburg, police closed off the main thoroughfare Nevsky Prospekt, shut Metro stations and police cars were parked all across the centre, an AFP journalist reported.   Police were seen roughly detaining several protesters, including one young man who was left with a bloodied head.  Local media reported that police used tear gas and tasers in the city, while one policeman reportedly threatened protesters with his service weapon.   ""The whole centre is cordoned off,"" said Natalya Grigoryeva, who came to the Saint Petersburg rally with her daughter. ""And who is this all against, against their own people?""  Earlier protesters had rallied in cities including the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where dozens escaped the police on the frozen waters of the Amur Bay and danced in a circle.  Several thousand were also reported to have protested in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk despite temperatures dropping to -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).    - 'People are outraged' -    Local politician and Navalny ally Helga Pirogova told AFP that Sunday's protest in Novosibirsk was potentially bigger than the week before.  ""People are still outraged by what is happening,"" the 32-year-old said.  Russian authorities issued several warnings against participating in the unauthorised rallies and threatened criminal charges against protesters.  The head of Russia's Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, called Sunday's events a ""provocation"" and said they have ""nothing to do with protecting rights,"" news agency TASS reported.  Navalny is due in court several times next week, including on February 2 on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.   His wife Yulia posted a picture of her family on Instagram on Sunday, urging supporters to make their voices heard.  ""If we remain silent, then tomorrow they will come for any one of us,"" she wrote.  Navalny's team said Yulia was detained by police shortly after she announced her arrival at the rally on social media.  This week several Navalny associates were placed under house arrest pending charges for violating coronavirus restrictions by calling people to join protests.  In a continued effort to clamp down on online platforms used to coordinate the rallies, Russia's media watchdog on Sunday ordered social networks to block posts with ""false"" information about the protests, including those ""over-estimating"" numbers of participants.  Many of those joining the protests have voiced anger at authorities over a video released by Navalny's team alleging that Putin had been gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast, a claim denied by the Kremlin.  tbm-acl/mm/wai",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

""I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uighurs by the Chinese party-state,"" Pompeo said in a statement.  ""We will not remain silent. If the Chinese Communist Party is allowed to commit genocide and crimes against humanity against its own people, imagine what it will be emboldened to do to the free world, in the not-so-distant future,"" he said.  Pompeo's vociferous criticism of Beijing has been a hallmark of his tenure but he has earlier danced around directly alleging genocide, saying repeatedly that the treatment of Uighurs was reminiscent of Nazi Germany's policies.  Pompeo urged all international bodies including courts to take up cases over China's treatment of the Uighurs and voiced confidence that the United States would keep raising pressure.  Rights groups believe that at least one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking Muslims are incarcerated in camps in the western region of Xinjiang.  Witnesses and activists say that China is seeking to forcibly integrate the Uighurs into the majority Han culture by eradicating Islamic customs, including by forcing Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol, forbidden by their faith.  China denies wrongdoing and contends that its camps are vocational training centers meant to reduce the allure of Islamic extremism in the wake of attacks.  Unlike many decisions by Pompeo seen as boxing in President-elect Joe Biden, the genocide declaration could be welcomed by the new administration.  Biden himself had accused outgoing president Donald Trump of not doing enough on human rights in China, with his campaign in August using the term genocide when describing the ""unspeakable oppression"" of the Uighurs and other minorities.  Pompeo's declaration means that the Biden administration could stand by the genocide declaration while potentially finding areas of cooperation with China without facing Beijing's anger for issuing the statement.  Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee to be treasury secretary, in her confirmation hearing Tuesday vowed to use the ""full array of tools"" against China of trade and other purported abuses.    - Culmination of pressure -    The Trump administration has already taken a number of steps to pressure China over its treatment of the Uighurs, including blocking all imports of cotton from Xinjiang -- one of the major global producers of yarn used in textile manufacturing.  Successive US administrations have been cautious about using the term genocide, mindful of legal implications at home and abroad.  George W. Bush's administration described Sudan's scorched-earth campaign in Darfur as genocide, while Barack Obama's administration said likewise about the Islamic State extremist group's mass killings, rape and enslavement of Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities.  Lawmakers across the political spectrum have called on the United States to declare that China is carrying out genocide against the Uighurs, saying that evidence was increasingly clear.  Representative Michael Waltz, a Republican, praised Pompeo's declaration as acknowledging reality and said it ""serves notice to the rest of the world in how they should deal with the Chinese Communist Party.""   In a study last year, German researcher Adrian Zenz found that China has forcibly sterilized large numbers of Uighur women and pressured them to abort pregnancies that exceed birth quotas. China denied the account, saying that Uighur women were breaking free from ""extremism"" by using contraception.  Pompeo in his statement called on China to ""abolish its system of internment, detention camps, house arrest and forced labor"" and ""cease coercive population control measures, including forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced birth control, and the removal of children from their families.""  He also urged China to ""end all torture and abuse"" in custody and allow Uighurs and other minorities to emigrate.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Revenue more than doubled to $8.1 billion in the three months through June, a 105 percent increase, at a time when many tech companies are struggling to navigate global economic turbulence.  Still, the firm posted a net loss of $2.6 billion, but investors shrugged it off and shares were up about 13 percent in early trading on Wall Street.  Uber primarily attributed the loss to the falling value of its investments in financially-strapped companies such as Singapore's VTC Grab, US self-driving vehicle start-up Aurora and Indian food delivery service Zomato.  The ride hailing giant posted $1.8 billion in revenue from its freight operations, and said income figures got a boost from a change in how it accounts for its rides business in Britain.   Uber also notched gains in monthly active platform consumers, gross bookings and trips compared with a year ago, reflecting higher demand but also a higher number of drivers for its signature ride service and food delivery operations.    - Inflation attracts new drivers -    ""We continue to benefit from an... increase in the on-demand transportation of people and things,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said. ""We intend to continue capitalizing on these growth tailwinds.""  Analysts noted that the relatively robust earnings were well above expectations, a relief during an earnings season buffeted by inflation, economic uncertainty and the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Consumers are still moving to the Uber platform especially as travel, shifting to the office, and other post-pandemic trends take hold globally,"" wrote analyst Dan Ives.  Uber reported it now has nearly five million drivers and couriers on its platform, a 31 percent increase from last year.   ""We saw an acceleration in both active and new driver growth in the quarter,"" Khosrowshahi. ""Against the backdrop of elevated gas prices globally, this is a resounding endorsement.""  Uber noted that some 70 percent of drivers coming to the platform said inflation played a part in their decision, as people look for additional income to offset price increases.

Voting in Kampala took place under heavy military and police presence, with no violent incidents reported by the time polling stations closed.  Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, having ruled for almost four decades, against singer-turned-MP Bobi Wine, 38, whose popularity among a youthful population has rattled the former rebel leader.  After a campaign marred by arrests, bloodshed and harassment of the opposition and journalists, the internet was shut down on the eve of the election, further fuelling fears the vote would not be free and fair.  In the Kololo neighbourhood of Kampala, polling agents opened ballot boxes onto a black tarp and counted each vote aloud as tallying began. Results are expected Saturday.  Wine said several of his party's polling agents had been arrested during the morning, as he cast his vote on the outskirts of Kampala alongside his wife before a crowd of dancing and singing supporters.  ""In 22 districts our teams are on the run because they are being surrounded and pursued by police and soldiers as if they are criminals,"" he said.  Soldiers marched in Kamwokya, the crowded Kampala slum where Wine grew up and is hugely popular, while convoys of riot police patrolled the capital.  Museveni voted in his home district of Kiruhura in rural western Uganda, about 250 kilometres (155 miles) from the capital.   ""The president has voted, he is sure of winning, but he will accept the result of the election so long as they are free and fair,"" Don Wanyama, the presidential spokesman, told AFP.  - Delayed voting -  Wine is the strongest of 10 opposition contenders. But Museveni has never lost an election, and most observers expect he and his ruling National Resistance Movement will emerge victorious.  Nevertheless optimism was high in the opposition heartland of Kamwokya, where voters jostled into tight queues despite efforts to impose social distancing after weeks of rising coronavirus cases.  ""I am here to change the leadership of this nation because for years, they've been telling me they will secure my future. They have not done that,"" said driver Joseph Nsuduga, 30.  Some 18 million voters are registered for the presidential and parliamentary vote, and results are expected by Saturday.  ""I continue to encourage all Ugandans to turn out and vote,"" Wine said.  Voting was delayed in several locations in Kampala and queues snaked for hours, with Wine complaining of problems with the biometric machines used to confirm voter identities.  ""People have been waiting for so long,"" said Kyazike Eva, 50.  The opposition frontrunner has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.  - Generation gap -    Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  He has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  But he is still held in high regard by older Ugandans who remember the relative stability and security that Museveni returned to the country.  ""These young people, they want change, but they don't know what Museveni did for us,"" said Faith Florence Nakalembe, 58.  But her children, also standing in line in Kamwokya to vote, desperately want change.  Sophie Mukoone, 34, said she spent months trying to change her mother's mind, but at least her brother Saad was out voting for the first time.  ""For 23 years I have never seen a different president, and I want someone else,"" said 23-year-old student Saad Mukoone, who was throwing his vote behind Wine.  ""Most of the people in government are old, and they don't want to leave.""  - Crackdown -    The runup to polling day was marred by a sustained crackdown on Museveni's rivals and government critics, and unprecedented attacks on the nation's media and human rights defenders.  In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces loyal to Museveni during protests against one of Wine's numerous arrests.  The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  On Tuesday, Museveni announced the suspension of social media networks and messaging services like Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp in response to Facebook closing accounts linked to government officials the tech giant said were spreading misinformation.  str-np-fb/tgb   FACEBOOK    Twitter","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

""The power plant in Gaza has stopped (working) due to the fuel shortage,"" said Mohammed Thabet, spokesman for the electricity company.   The power station has gone without fuel deliveries through Israel since the country shut its goods and people crossings with Gaza on Tuesday.   The electricity supply is expected to plummet to just four hours a day, Thabet said.   Diesel for the power plant is usually trucked in from Egypt or Israel, which has maintained a blockade of the enclave since the militant group Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007.   Israel's closure of its crossings with Gaza came as the military braced for reprisals following the arrest of two senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad members in the occupied West Bank.   The group did not retaliate until Israel launched pre-emptive air strikes on the enclave Friday, prompting militants to fire rockets towards Israel.   In a statement earlier on Saturday, Gaza's electricity company said the shutdown ""will affect all public utilities and crucial installations and exacerbate the humanitarian situation"".   The company called on ""all parties to urgently intervene and allow the entrance of fuel deliveries for the power plant to work.""   Gaza's 2.3 million residents experience regular power shortages and last week received only an average of 10 hours of electricity per day, according to data from the UN's humanitarian agency OCHA.  bur-rsc/it",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

AFP spoke to some Trump supporters about what they think Trump will do next and what they believe life will be like under the new Democratic administration.  - 'I believe they cheated' -  ""When Trump was inaugurated, I was so happy,"" said Gia Maxson, a yoga teacher and devout Catholic from Hickory, North Carolina.  ""I went to two Trump rallies. They were wonderful, uplifting, positive experiences,"" she added.  Maxson refuses to believe that Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol two weeks' ago, even though it was caught on countless cameras.   ""That was all staged so they could shut them down. They tried everything in their power to get rid of him in the beginning. They finally figured out a way to assassinate him.""   ""I am fearful, angry, absolutely stunned this could happen in America,"" she said.   She usually watches inaugurations but decided not to tune in this year.   ""I believe it is completely illegitimate, I believe they cheated. There is no way Biden got 80 million votes,"" says Maxson, referring to unfounded claims of voter fraud.  Maxson believes Trump won't go away.   ""I hope a new party can be launched -- the Patriot Party. That would be the best case scenario, the end of the two-party system.""    - Impeachment 'unconstitutional' -  Doug McLinko, a local Republican representative in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, worries that the Democratic Party might try to scrap the Electoral College system.  ""Rural America will have no voice, only major metropolitan areas,"" he said.   ""This country has never been as divided,"" added McLinko, saying he takes issues with some on the left referring to Trump supporters as neo-Nazis.   ""You call somebody a Nazi -- I don't think there is a worse phrase and yet that's what they do and next they talk about healing the country,"" said McLinko.  ""I think the impeachment is completely unconstitutional. They seem to forget that 75 million people voted for him,"" he added, also believing that Trumpism is here to stay.  ""The national populism is more than Donald Trump and that is going nowhere.""    - No confidence in Biden -  ""I feel like Biden's going to undo everything that Trump's done,"" said Sharon McGettrick, a health insurance worker from Clearwater, Florida.   ""I was hoping that we would still continue with this immigration situation, with the wall which now they're saying that they're not going to.   ""We're not going to have those choices anymore, to have that freedom of speech. They're trying to take guns away too,"" she added.  McGettrick believes the Covid-19 pandemic was ""orchestrated"" by China to damage the United States financially.  ""There is no middle class anymore. You're either rich or you're poor. I'm making $31,000 a year, which if you look at the statistics means I'm in poverty.  ""Maybe I should not be so presumptuous and think that he's not going to do things for our country but I just don't have the confidence in him like I get with Trump,"" she concluded.    - Trump 'not going away' -  Tim Hearn, a small business owner from the Charlotte area of North Carolina, says politicians in Washington have ""created an environment within Congress that has become more of a job and a lifestyle than a position of service to the country.""  ""Trump brought jobs back to America that were sent overseas by previous administration, whether they were Republican or Democrat. It wasn't just a red versus blue scenario. It was America versus the globalists,"" said Hearn.  He thinks energy costs are going to go up under Biden's administration, which will kill his business.  ""If he wants to raise the minimum wage, it is going to hurt us as well,"" he added.  Hearn thinks Biden's government will do ""everything they can"" to ""cancel"" Trumpism.

The resulting wall of water and debris barrelled down a tight valley in India's Himalayan north on Sunday morning, destroying bridges, roads and hitting two hydroelectric power plants.  Uttarakhand Director General of Police Ashok Kumar said late Monday that 26 bodies had been recovered, and 171 people were still unaccounted for.  Most of those missing were workers at the two power plants, with some trapped in a U-shaped tunnel filled with mud and rocks when the flooding hit.  ""If this incident happened in the evening, after work hours, the situation wouldn't have been this bad as labourers and workers in and around the sites would have been at home,"" Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat told reporters.  Twelve people were rescued from one side of the tunnel on Sunday but another 34 were still trapped at the other end, the Indo Tibetan Border Police's Banudutt Nair, who is in charge of the rescue operation, told AFP.  With the main road washed away, paramilitary rescuers were forced to scale down a hillside on ropes to reach the entrance. Emergency workers were using heavy machinery to remove tonnes of rocks.  ""Approximately 80 metres (260 feet) inside the tunnel is cleared and accessible,"" said Vivek Kumar Pandey, another disaster official.  Around 1,000 rescuers -- including from the military, police and national disaster personnel -- resumed their search operation at first light on Monday.  Three excavators had reached the site, with one removing the slush and depositing it in the nearby river, Nair said, adding that the semi-liquid debris was estimated to be around 180 metres deep.  Rescuers believed there were air pockets in the tunnel, Nair added.    - 'Grim reminder' -    Scores of social media users captured the disaster, with footage showing water tearing through the narrow valley with terrifying force.  ""We were 300 metres inside the tunnel working. Suddenly there was whistling and shouting telling us to get out,"" said survivor Rajesh Kumar, 28.  ""We started running out but the water gushed in. It was like scenes from a Hollywood movie. We thought we wouldn't make it,"" he told AFP.  Deepak Kumar, whose brother Bharminer is trapped inside the tunnel, said six of the workers had come from his village in Lakhimpur Kheri in the state of Uttar Pradesh.  ""Out of that, one survived and he informed us, and the moment that we heard that our brother is trapped inside the tunnel, we jumped into the car"" and drove around 400 kilometres overnight, Kumar told AFP outside the tunnel.  Authorities said initially that the cause was a chunk of glacier breaking off into a river, but the trigger may instead have been a phenomenon called a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF).  This is when the boundaries of a glacial lake -- formed when a glacier retreats -- are breached, releasing large amounts of water downstream.   It is possible that this in turn was caused by an avalanche. The incident may also have been triggered by water pockets inside a glacier bursting.  Glaciers in the region have been shrinking rapidly in recent years because of global warming, but experts say that the construction of hydroelectric plants could also be a factor.  Floods in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of projects in Uttarakhand, a state of 10 million people bordering Tibet and Nepal.  Vimlendhu Jha, the founder of Swechha, an environmental NGO, said the disaster was a ""grim reminder"" of the effects of climate change and the ""haphazard development of roads, railways and power plants in ecologically sensitive areas"".  A major study in 2019 said that two-thirds of Himalayan glaciers, the world's ""Third Pole"", could melt by 2100 if global emissions are not sharply reduced.  Glaciers in the region are a critical source of water for hundreds of millions of people, feeding many of the world's most important river systems.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105358710']

The initiative, which appears certain to fail, flies in the face of rulings in dozens of courts and the findings by officials in several key states, that there were no widespread voting problems.   The Republicans' statement, signed by Cruz and six other current senators along with four senators-elect, asserts that ""allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.""  The group said that when Congress convenes in a joint session on Wednesday -- for what normally would be a pro-forma certification of Biden's victory -- they will demand the creation of a special commission to conduct an ""emergency 10-day audit"" of the election results.   The statement says individual states could then convene special legislative sessions and potentially revise their vote totals.  ""An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can't let it happen!"" Trump tweeted Saturday.  Posting a list of the 11 senators, Trump added: ""And after they see the facts, plenty more to come...Our Country will love them for it!""   They join Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who said earlier that he planned to raise objections on Wednesday.   A Republican member of the House of Representatives, Louie Gohmert, has also announced his plan to oppose certification, and more than 100 House Republicans reportedly will back his challenge.  Gohmert sought to further raise the stakes with a lawsuit that would have given Vice President Mike Pence -- traditionally in a ceremonial role in Wednesday's session -- the power to overturn the election result.  Pence opposed that effort, and a federal judge in Texas on Friday rejected the suit.  On Saturday, a federal appeals court upheld that dismissal.  The Hawley and Gohmert challenges will ensure that Congress must meet to hear the complaints.     - 'The Electoral College has spoken' -    The Congress sessions, sure to be contentious, will play out against a backdrop of pro-Trump rallies in Washington next week encouraged by the president himself.   As with Trump's other attempts to reverse his election defeat, the latest political maneuvering appears doomed. Democrats control the House, and many Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday for certification.  The 11 senators conceded that most Democrats and ""more than a few Republicans"" would likely oppose their initiative.  Among them is Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose state was a battleground that helped tip Biden into the win column. Its result is expected to be among those contested on Wednesday.  ""A fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders,"" Toomey said on Twitter.   ""The effort by Sens. Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right.""  He added: ""I voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday, I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.""  Utah Senator Mitt Romney, a vocal Trump opponent and onetime presidential candidate who lost a 2012 White House bid to Barack Obama, dismissed his colleagues' rationale as ""nonsense.""  ""The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic,"" Romney said in a statement.  ""Members of Congress who would substitute their own partisan judgment for that of the courts do not enhance public trust, they imperil it,"" he said, adding, ""Has ambition so eclipsed principle?""  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has urged fellow Republicans to vote to certify and avoid a divisive political brawl, saying, ""The Electoral College has spoken.""  Biden won in the all-important Electoral College by a vote of 306 to 232.  Cruz is considered a likely 2024 presidential candidate. Hawley is also said to be positioning himself for a 2024 run -- and so is Pence.  bur-to/acb","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

Vladimir Putin's top opponent has been imprisoned since mid-January on his return to Russia from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from poisoning with a nerve agent that he blames on the Russian president.  But even from behind bars, the 44-year-old anti-graft campaigner has managed to score points in his battle with the Kremlin.   In addition to Saturday's rallies across Russia, his investigation into a luxury complex on the country's Black Sea coast that he alleges is owned by Putin has garnered more than 85 million views in less than a week.  The Kremlin, which recently described Navalny as a ""blogger of no interest to anyone,"" was even forced into parrying his blows.  Putin on Monday denied he or any of his family owned the palace and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday dismissed the weekend protests.  ""Few people came out, while many vote for Putin,"" Peskov said on the state-run Rossiya 1 channel.  Yet despite the dismissals, Navalny's budding protest movement is far from trivial.   With parliamentary elections coming up in September, the opposition figure is aiming to build support for unseating the ruling United Russia party, which has seen its approval ratings slide in recent years.    - No 'euphoria' -    In comments to AFP, Leonid Volkov, Navalny's right-hand man, hailed Saturday's protests as ""historic"".  Later on social media he announced that further rallies would take place across the country on Sunday at noon.  Andrei Kolesnikov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Moscow Centre, expects that the protest mood will not dissipate immediately.  But he warned against ""euphoria"" for the opposition.  ""The regime has a huge resource for survival, including the still indifferent majority of the population,"" he wrote on Twitter.  Volkov also admitted that the battle will be ""difficult"" and in the wake of the protests, the Russian law enforcement machine revved into motion.  After police detained a record number of nearly 3,700 people in 125 cities, local media reported that investigators by Monday morning had launched a raft of criminal cases into violence against law enforcement officials.  Later Monday a protester was handed the first punishment, the TASS state news agency reported, of 10 days in detention.    - 'Political paedophiles' -    The protesters were ultimately risking punishment in the hopes of helping Navalny escape prison time.  On February 2 a court will begin hearing whether his 2014 suspended sentence for fraud of 3.5 years should be converted to prison time for skipping out on twice-monthly meetings with Russia's prison service while he was in Germany.  Navalny is also the target of an investigation for large-scale fraud, a charge punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and faces libel charges in a trial that is set to commence on February 5.   Meanwhile, with Navalny's team mobilising protesters ahead of the weekend rallies online, authorities are increasing the pressure on tech platforms.  Their ire has landed in particular on TikTok, a video-sharing app popular among teens, where thousands shared videos in support of the protests in advance.   On the eve of the rallies, the Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, launched a probe over the ""inciting of minors to participate in illegal activities that could endanger their lives"".   The government stance is that Navalny, with the help of social media, has manipulated Russia's youth for political ends.  Dmitry Kiselyov, a popular television presenter known for his pro-Kremlin views, used his Sunday primetime programme to accuse Navalny of crafting his ""propaganda in such a way that among his supporters there are many adolescents and children.""  Kiselyov, who is under Western sanctions, put his own view of Navalny and his team succinctly: ""Political paedophiles"".   as-alf-emg/mm/ach",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105137806']

The special rapporteurs insisted such harassment must stop, and said residents continue to be threatened by the risk of forcible transfer, including mass forced evictions and arbitrary displacement.  ""Israeli authorities' hubris is proving without limits. They are even harassing human rights defenders and humanitarian workers seeking to support and protect people facing grave human rights violations in Masafer Yatta,"" the four experts said in a joint statement.  ""This is a direct assault on the core of human rights and international humanitarian law... this also confirms that impunity over abuse of power fosters power to abuse.""  The case of Masafer Yatta -- or Firing Zone 918 -- an agricultural area near Hebron, has been one of Israel's longest running legal battles.   In the early 1980s the army declared the 30-square-kilometre (12-square-mile) territory a restricted military area and claimed it was uninhabited.  Residents of eight villages had been in court for around 20 years fighting Israeli government efforts to evict them.  But in May this year, Israel's High Court approved the eviction of Palestinian villagers to make way for a military training zone.  ""The tragic implications of that decision are now before our eyes: roughly 1,200 Palestinian residents in Masafer Yatta are left defenceless in front of the threat of forced eviction and arbitrary displacement,"" said the experts, who do not speak for the United Nations but are mandated to report their findings to it.  The statement was penned by a special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory as well as rapporteurs on internally displaced persons, adequate housing, and the situation of human rights defenders.  They voiced dismay at reports that human rights defenders and humanitarian workers have been harassed by the Israeli military in Masafer Yatta.  ""They have been stopped and detained for several hours at checkpoints and had their identification documents or cars confiscated, often on grounds that they had entered a closed military site without permission,"" their statement said.  The experts expressed particular concern for Sami Hureini, a prominent human rights defender and member of the ""Youth of Sumud"" activist group ""engaged in peaceful resistance against illegal settlements in the southern Hebron hills"".  On June 28, he was reportedly arrested at a checkpoint in Masafer Yatta and detained by the military for several hours, the experts said.  ""He is currently being tried in the Ofer Military Court for allegedly obstructing and assaulting a soldier and entering a closed military zone, following his participation in a peaceful demonstration on 8 January 2021,"" they said.  Hureini's attorney, Riham Nasra, said her legal team has presented ""hundreds of photos and videos"" to disprove the allegations against her client.  ""Five activists who were near Sami during the protest testified that at no point did Sami resort to violence,"" Nasra told AFP in a statement.

It was unclear how many passengers and crew were aboard Sriwijaya Air's Boeing 737-500, which has a capacity of about 130, when it left Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta international airport.  But 62 passengers and crew were listed on an unconfirmed manifest, including seven children and three infants, local media reported.  The usual flight time is about 90 minutes over the Java Sea between Indonesia's main Java island and Kalimantan, the country's section of Borneo island.  Data from FlightRadar24 said the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  ""Sriwijaya Air flight #SJ182 lost more than 10,000 feet of altitude in less than one minute, about 4 minutes after departure from Jakarta,"" the tracking agency said on its official Twitter account.  Broadcaster Kompas TV quoted local fishermen as saying they had found debris near islands just off the coast of the capital Jakarta, but it could not be immediately confirmed as having belonged to the missing jet.  Indonesia's transport ministry said it was probing the incident.  ""A Sriwijaya (Air) plane from Jakarta to Pontianak (on Borneo island) with call sign SJY182 has lost contact,"" said ministry spokesman Adita Irawati.  ""It last made contact at 2:40 pm (0740 GMT).""  The budget airline, which has about 19 Boeing jets that fly to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  Indonesia's search and rescue agency and the National Transportation Safety Commission were also investigating, Irawati said.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and a subsequent fatal flight in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  However, Indonesia's aviation sector has long suffered from a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.

And amid a tight American job market, hiring slowed for the third straight month, but firms are reporting less trouble filling open positions and no signs of layoffs, the Institute for Supply Management's latest report showed.  But firms continue to have trouble filling orders due to ongoing problems getting materials.  ISM's manufacturing index dipped to 52.8 percent, just two-tenths below the prior month, but the lowest level since June 2020 during the pandemic downturn.  However, that level was still above the 50-percent threshold indicating expansion for the 26th consecutive month.  ""The U.S. manufacturing sector continues expanding -- though slightly less so in July -- as new order rates continue to contract, supplier deliveries improve and prices soften to acceptable levels,"" ISM manufacturing survey chair Timothy Fiore said.  The new orders index fell 1.2 points, to 48 percent, signaling a slowdown, and production fell by slightly more but continues to grow.  ""Lead times remain at elevated levels, and fundamental raw material prices continue to persuade buyers to remain on the sidelines,"" Fiore said  The prices index fell a whopping 18.5 points -- the fourth biggest decline on record -- to 60 percent, with a much higher share of firms reporting falling prices, the survey showed. The index has been above 60 percent for nearly two years.  Covid-19 lockdowns in China and Russia's war in Ukraine have been exacerbating shortages experienced, fueling the global inflation surge, especially for energy, and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise borrowing costs aggressively.  Survey respondents noted ongoing supply issues and the impact of rising prices, and several expressed concern about the future  ""Our markets are still holding up; however, I believe a slowdown is coming,"" one said. ""I believe the general market is in the beginnings of a recession.""  Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics said challenges are mounting for firms.  ""Manufacturers will face many of the same challenges in the second half of 2022 that they did in H1,"" he said in an analysis.  ""The confluence of hot inflation, higher interest rates, ongoing supply chain issues and normalizing spending patterns will make demand more fragile.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96016136']

The deal, expected to come into effect at 11:30 pm (2030 GMT) on Sunday, raises hopes of an imminent cessation of the worst fighting in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the impoverished Palestinian coastal territory.  ""A short while ago the wording of the Egyptian truce agreement was reached,"" senior Islamic Jihad member Mohammad al-Hindi said in a statement.  The militant movement confirmed the timing of the ceasefire but said it ""reserves the right to respond to any Zionist aggression"", according to a statement.  As Islamic Jihad confirmed it agreed to the truce, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid was still meeting with Israeli security officials.  Earlier in the day, an Egyptian security source said that Israel ""has accepted"" a ceasefire.  Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation.  Multiple air raid sirens sounded hours before the expected truce.  Gaza's health ministry on Sunday evening raised the death toll to 43 including 15 children, with more than 300 people wounded in the Palestinian enclave, which is run by the Islamist group Hamas.  Three people in Israel have been wounded by shrapnel over the same period, while 31 others have been lightly hurt, emergency services said on Sunday.  Islamic Jihad's Hindi said the ceasefire deal ""contains Egypt's commitment to work towards the release of two prisoners"".  The pair were named as Bassem al-Saadi, a senior figure in the group's political wing who was recently arrested in the occupied West Bank, and Khalil Awawdeh, a militant also in Israeli detention.    - 'Terrifying' -    Buildings in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, while Israelis have been forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets.  Nour Abu Sultan, who lives in the west of Gaza, said earlier Sunday that she was ""awaiting the declaration of the ceasefire on tenterhooks"".  ""We haven't slept for days (due to) heat and shelling and rockets, the sound of aircrafts hovering above us... is terrifying,"" the 29-year-old said.  Dalia Harel, a resident in the Israeli town of Sderot close to the Gaza border, said she was ""disappointed"" at news of a truce despite her five children being ""traumatised"".  ""We're tired of having a military operation every year,"" she said. ""We need our military and political leaders to get it over with once and for all... we're not for war, but we can't go on like this.""  An AFP photographer saw two rockets being intercepted in the centre of Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv on Sunday evening.  Two Islamic Jihad rockets earlier in the day had targeted Jerusalem, but they were shot down by the Israeli army.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.  The Israeli army has said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"".  Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.  ""Every minute we receive injured people,"" he said earlier Sunday.    - Top militants killed -    The army said it had struck over a hundred Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets and mortars, some of them falling short inside Gaza.  Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Gaza's northern Jabalia area on Saturday.  An AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the hospital there, including three minors.  ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   Amid the high tensions, Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.  Some Palestinians shouted ""God is greatest"" in response, and an AFP photographer was briefly detained by Israeli police, but commemorations passed without major incident.  Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation Friday against Islamic Jihad, which it said was planning an imminent attack.  The army has killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south.  bur-pjm/lg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

It added that the fire was extinguished ""in a timely manner"" and there were no casualties.   Earlier, a Belarusian Telegram channel that monitors military activity said ""explosions"" were heard near the Zyabrovka airfield in southeastern Belarus.   ""At least eight flashes"" were seen in the night of Wednesday to Thursday, it added.  Franak Viacorka, a senior advisor to Belarusian exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, said Russian military aircraft are often stationed at the airfield.  Zyabrovka is around 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the border with northern Ukraine.   The incident comes after a series of blasts at a key military airbase on the Russian-annexed Crimea peninsula, which Moscow said were caused by exploding ammunition rather than Ukrainian fire.  Western countries have slapped ex-Soviet Belarus with new sanctions this year for its role in Russia's Ukraine offensive launched on February 24.   Russian troops entered Ukraine from several directions, including from Belarusian territory.

Results published by the ex-Soviet country's Central Election Commission (CEC) showed Japarov with close to 80 percent of the vote after an automated count.  A referendum held in parallel showed Kyrgyz strongly preferring presidential rule, which would grant Japarov sweeping powers when a new constitution is passed, most probably later this year.  The referendum vote spells the end of political system adopted a decade ago to tame authoritarianism after two successive strongman presidents were ejected from power during street protests in 2005 and 2010.  Just over 10 percent supported a parliamentarian system.  Japarov, 52, was serving jail time on hostage-taking charges when protests in October saw him freed by supporters and propelled to the top of the political pyramid.  CEC data Sunday showed his closest competitor, nationalist Adakhan Madumarov, trailing with less than 7 percent.  Japarov's journey from prison to the presidency is an example of the dramatic changes in political fortunes in the Central Asian country that is both more unpredictable and pluralistic than its authoritarian neighbours.  As results trickled in, portable toilets and a stage were set up on the main square of the capital Bishkek -- the scene of clashes between police and protesters that left one protester dead in October -- as supporters gathered to mark his victory.   Critics of Japarov, who became acting leader during the unrest, fear his victory and the vote for presidential rule could tip Kyrgyzstan towards the authoritarianism dominant in ex-Soviet Central Asia region.   In Bishkek, where cold winters usher in a thick blanket of smog courtesy of polluting heating systems and ageing transport, many voters had said they intended to back Japarov at the ballot box.  ""He has promised to raise salaries, pensions,"" said Vera Pavlova, 69, who admitted that she knew little about other candidates.  ""I haven't seen their posters anywhere. Only Japarov's.""     - Crime, corruption -    Japarov has styled himself as an uncompromising opponent of organised crime and systemic corruption and lashed out at critics who speculated that criminal networks helped his rise to power.  But he struck a unifying tone in his last campaign appearance on Friday in Bishkek.  ""Let us come together... treat each other with understanding and respect. We are one country, one people,"" he told crowds of several thousand people.  With a threadbare economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Kyrgyzstan's next leader is likely to be even more dependent on Russia -- a destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrants -- and neighbouring economic giant China.  Russian President Vladimir Putin recently described the overthrow of the previous government as a ""misfortune"" and also chided Kyrgyz politicians for attempting to imitate Western democracies.  Beijing's ambassador met with Kyrgyz officials several times last year to discuss protection for Chinese businesses, some of which were attacked during the unrest.  Mountainous Kyrgyzstan's votes are more competitive than in its ex-Soviet neighbours, but they have rarely offered an even playing field.  The crisis that allowed for Japarov's overnight rehabilitation and rise to power was sparked by vote-buying campaigns favouring former president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.  Jeenbekov resigned at the insistence of Japarov's supporters and after agreeing to sign off on Japarov's election as prime minister by parliament.  Japarov also became acting president following the resignation during the political chaos but he stepped down from both roles to compete in the vote.  Yet rivals complained that his campaign benefited from the resources of the state, where his allies now occupy top posts.  Bekjol Nurmatov, a 77-year-old retiree, accused Japarov of ""plunging the people into chaos"" last year.      The pensioner noted that Japarov had failed to show up for televised debates between candidates and accused him of ""hiding from the people.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024']

At least 13 civilians lost their lives and dozens were wounded in the gun and bomb attack by the Al-Qaeda-linked group that began on Friday evening and lasted over a day, leaving many feared trapped inside the popular Hayat Hotel.  On Sunday morning, the area surrounding the hotel was quiet and the roads blocked by a heavy security presence as emergency workers and bomb disposal experts sought to clear the premises of any explosives and remove rubble.  The hotel building sustained heavy damage during the gunfight between Somali forces and the militants, causing some parts of it to collapse and leaving many people frantic for their loved ones who were inside when the attack began.  Police commissioner Abdi Hassan Mohamed Hijar told reporters on Sunday that ""106 people including children and women"" were rescued by security forces during the siege which ended around midnight.  As bullets and flames ripped through the hotel, security forces searched the property to bring civilians to safety, including three young children who hid inside a toilet.  ""The casualties mostly happened in the early hours of the attack, after that security forces spent time rescuing people individually and room by room,"" Hijar said.  He did not however provide an update on the number of casualties, saying only that the ministry of health would brief journalists later in the day.  The attack was the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June, and underscored the challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist militant group.    - 'Tense' -    Dozens of people gathered near the road leading up to the hotel on Sunday morning, desperate for news of their family members as security forces guarded the area, not letting anyone through.  Businessman Muktar Adan, whose brother was inside the hotel when the attack started, told AFP he was waiting for permission to enter the premises and look for his sibling.  ""My brother was inside the hotel the last time we heard from him, but his phone is switched off now and we don't know what to expect,"" he said.  Said Nurow, who heard the attack unfold, said he was very worried about his friend who was a guest at the property.  ""I hope... (he) is alive, he stayed in the hotel according to the last information we got from his sister,"" he told AFP, describing the mood as ""tense"".  The hotel was a favoured meeting spot for government officials and scores of people were inside when gunmen stormed the property.   Somalia's allies, including the United States, Britain and Turkey, as well as the UN, have strongly condemned the attack. So did ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  Earlier this month, Washington announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - Twin explosions -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  According to police, the attack began with a blast caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel along with gunmen.  Minutes later, a second explosion struck as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to help the injured, witnesses said.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  Al-Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office, and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopian border.  The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, but still control swathes of countryside and retain the ability to launch deadly strikes, often targeting hotels and restaurants.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  str-amu/ach",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

She picks out a yellowed copy of an Arabic-language newspaper printed in the 1880s, then walks to the sections containing French, Italian, Maltese and Spanish-language newspapers published in Tunisia.  ""The archive is a witness to an important, historical culture,"" Gabsi said under the flickering neon lights.  The library's collection includes some 16,000 titles printed in Tunisia -- numbering hundreds of thousands of editions of newspapers and periodicals.  As part of a campaign to preserve the country's archives, the library staff have been working to digitise the documents.  Most of the newspapers are in Arabic, with the oldest from the mid-19th century when Tunisia was an Ottoman province.  After France occupied Tunisia in 1881, European settlers published periodicals in several languages, including French, Italian, Spanish and Maltese.  Some publications are even in Judeo-Arabic, a local Arabic dialect written in the Hebrew alphabet.  Gabsi selects a copy of Voix d'Israel, a Hebrew-language newspaper printed by Tunisia's Jewish community, which numbered around 100,000 when the country gained independence from France in 1956.  Further along the shelves, she picks out L'Unione, published in 1886 by an Italian community that would number some 130,000 by the middle of the following century.  Nearby, technicians use huge scanners to digitise the newspapers and other documents, which have been made available to the public online since May.  The library's director Raja Ben Slama has brought together a team of around 20 employees to accelerate the process.  She said the importance of preserving the newspapers was clear to her when she arrived in 2015.  ""We are in a race against time with the elements against the deterioration of the periodicals,"" she said.  Some of them ""can't be found anywhere else"", she added.  Many of the publications have disappeared, particularly those published in Italian, Hebrew and Maltese.  Economic woes and tensions sparked by the Arab-Israeli conflict led to the departure of most of the country's Jewish community, while most Italians left in the years after independence.  For historian Abdessattar Amamou, the archives are rare in the region, reflecting the ""mosaic"" of different communities that were present in the North African country.

More than 170 others were listed as missing after a wall of water and debris barrelled down a tight valley in India's north early Sunday, destroying bridges, roads and hitting two hydroelectric power plants.  Uttarakhand Director General of Police Ashok Kumar said late Monday that 26 bodies had been recovered, and 171 people remained unaccounted for.  Most of those missing were workers at the two power plants, with some trapped in a U-shaped 2.7-kilometre (1.67-mile) tunnel in Tapovan that filled with mud and rocks when the flood hit.  Twelve people were rescued from one side of the tunnel on Sunday but another 34 were still trapped at the other end, the Indo Tibetan Border Police's Banudutt Nair, who is in charge of the rescue operation, told AFP.  The semi-liquid debris was estimated to be around 180 metres deep, but rescuers believed there were air pockets in the tunnel, Nair added.  ""Approximately 80 metres inside the tunnel is cleared and accessible,"" said Vivek Kumar Pandey, another disaster official.  With the main road washed away, paramilitary rescuers had been forced to scale down a hillside on ropes to reach the entrance. Emergency workers were using heavy machinery to remove tonnes of rocks.  Around 1,000 rescuers -- including from the military, police and national disaster personnel -- aided the search operation on Monday.  ""If this incident happened in the evening, after work hours, the situation wouldn't have been this bad as labourers and workers in and around the sites would have been at home,"" Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat told reporters.  Giant floodlights lit up one entrance of the tunnel late Monday as a huge excavator slowly worked its way through the sludge, carrying huge piles out and depositing it beside a river so rescuers could carefully search the debris for survivors or remains.  A short distance ahead, workers used an excavator to try to remove giant boulders from the road blocking the way to the second under-construction power plant.  The Rishi Ganga facility was destroyed and turned into a flattened wasteland covered with brown and grey slush, with a nearby concrete bridge that connects to China border swept away by the raging torrent of water.  At least 35 workers and locals are missing from the site.    - 'Grim reminder' -    Scores of social media users captured the disaster, with footage showing water tearing through the narrow valley with terrifying force.  ""We were 300 metres inside the tunnel working. Suddenly there was whistling and shouting telling us to get out,"" said survivor Rajesh Kumar, 28.  ""We started running out but the water gushed in. It was like scenes from a Hollywood movie. We thought we wouldn't make it,"" he told AFP.  Deepak Kumar, whose brother Bharminer was still trapped inside the tunnel, said six workers came from his village in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh state.  ""The moment that we heard that our brother is trapped inside the tunnel, we jumped into the car"" and drove around 400 kilometres (250 miles), Kumar told AFP outside the tunnel.  Authorities said initially the cause was a chunk of glacier breaking off into a river, but the trigger may instead have been a phenomenon called a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF).  This is when the boundaries of a glacial lake -- formed when a glacier retreats -- are breached, releasing large amounts of water downstream.   It is possible this was caused by an avalanche. The incident may also have been triggered by water pockets inside a glacier bursting.  Glaciers in the region have been shrinking rapidly in recent years because of global warming, but experts say the construction of hydroelectric plants could also be a factor.  Floods in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of projects in Uttarakhand, a state of 10 million people bordering Tibet and Nepal.  Vimlendhu Jha, the founder of Swechha, an environmental NGO, said the disaster was a ""grim reminder"" of the effects of climate change and the ""haphazard development of roads, railways and power plants in ecologically sensitive areas"".  Glaciers in the region are a critical source of water for hundreds of millions of people.  ja-ash-bb/stu/grk/sst",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105358710']

The initiative, which appears certain to fail, flies in the face of rulings in dozens of courts and the findings by officials in several key states that there were no widespread voting problems.  The Republicans' statement, signed by Cruz and six other current senators along with four senators-elect, asserts that ""allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.""  The group said that when Congress convenes in a joint session on Wednesday -- for what normally would be a pro-forma certification of Biden's victory -- they will demand the creation of a special commission to conduct an ""emergency 10-day audit"" of the election results.  The statement says individual states could then convene special legislative sessions and potentially revise their vote totals.  ""An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can't let it happen!"" Trump tweeted Saturday.  Posting a list of the 11 senators, Trump added: ""And after they see the facts, plenty more to come... Our Country will love them for it!""   They join Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who said earlier that he planned to raise objections on Wednesday.  A Republican member of the House of Representatives, Louie Gohmert, has also announced his plan to oppose certification, and more than 100 House Republicans reportedly will back his challenge.  Gohmert sought to further raise the stakes with a lawsuit that would have given Vice President Mike Pence -- traditionally in a ceremonial role in Wednesday's session -- the power to overturn the election result.  Pence opposed that effort, and a federal judge in Texas on Friday rejected the suit. On Saturday, a federal appeals court upheld that dismissal.  The Hawley and Gohmert challenges will ensure that Congress must meet to hear the complaints.    - 'The Electoral College has spoken' -    The Congress sessions, sure to be contentious, will play out against a backdrop of pro-Trump rallies in Washington next week.  As with Trump's other attempts to reverse his election defeat, the latest political maneuvering appears doomed. Democrats control the House, and many Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday for certification.  The 11 senators conceded that most Democrats and ""more than a few Republicans"" would likely oppose their initiative.  Among them is Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, a battleground state that helped Biden to victory. Its result is expected to be among those contested on Wednesday.  ""A fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders,"" Toomey tweeted.   ""The effort by Sens. Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right.""  He added: ""I voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday, I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.""  Responding to Toomey late Saturday night Hawley criticized the ""shameless personal attacks,"" and urged senators to avoid ""making unfounded claims about the intentions of our fellow senators.""  ""I never claim to speak for another senator, but I do speak for my constituents when they raise legitimate concerns about issues as important as the fairness of our elections,"" he said in a message to the Senate GOP conference, first reported by Politico.  Earlier, Utah Senator Mitt Romney, a vocal Trump opponent, dismissed his colleagues' rationale as ""nonsense.""  ""The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic,"" Romney said.  ""Members of Congress who would substitute their own partisan judgment for that of the courts do not enhance public trust, they imperil it,"" he added. ""Has ambition so eclipsed principle?""  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell also urged fellow Republicans to vote to certify and avoid a divisive political brawl.  Pence, however, is reportedly encouraging lawmakers to debate the baseless accusations of voting irregularities.  ""Vice President Pence shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election,"" his chief of staff Marc Short said in a statement to US news outlets.  Biden won in the all-important Electoral College by a vote of 306 to 232.  Cruz is considered a likely 2024 presidential candidate. Hawley is also said to be positioning himself for a 2024 run -- and so is Pence.  bur-to/axn/rbu","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

The supply of Sputnik V to separatist authorities is Russia's latest show of support for the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics, which have been locked in a simmering conflict with the Ukrainian army since 2014.  The leader of the so-called Donetsk republic Denis Pushilin said a first batch of ""several thousand"" Sputnik V doses had arrived and that doctors and soldiers would be inoculated first starting from Monday.  His counterpart in Lugansk Leonid Pasechnik also confirmed delivery without specifying the number of doses.  ""Thanks to the invaluable assistance of Russia, our republic has the opportunity to conduct voluntary free vaccinations,"" an official news website quoted Pasechnik as saying.  Authorities in the breakaway regions that have a combined population of around three million people have not said whether the vaccine was purchased or donated.  Lugansk's health minster said however that the jabs were part of a ""humanitarian convoy"" dispatched by Russia.  The announcements in eastern Ukraine come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky faced mounting pressure for his government's failure to begin vaccinations.  Ukraine, one of the poorest countries in Europe, is awaiting delivery of eight million doses promised under the UN Covax program and up to five million doses of the Chinese CoronaVac jab.  Zelensky last month called on the European Union to help Ukraine source vaccines as he came under fire at home for failing to source Western-made jabs for his country of 40 million people.  Pro-Moscow politicians have lobbied for the introduction of Sputnik V but health officials have rejected the calls, with critics saying the Russian vaccine is a geopolitical tool.  Ukraine has been fighting separatists backed by Russia in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions since 2014 following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula.  Since then, more than 13,000 people have died and nearly 1.5 million have been displaced.

The country's election commission announced that with 86.7 percent of polling stations reporting results, Museveni had 58.8 percent of votes, while former popstar Bobi Wine had 34.2 percent.  Final results are expected by Saturday afternoon.  Wine, 38, meanwhile was on track to see his newly formed National Unity Platform (NUP) become the main opposition party in Parliament, notably winning eight of nine constituencies in the capital Kampala.  The poll followed one of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and the deaths of at least 54 people.  Thursday's election took place in apparent calm, but under the oppressive presence of soldiers and riot police and an internet blackout which has now entered its fourth day.  However Wine has alleged widespread fraud such as ballot box stuffing and said his party agents had in some places been beaten and chased away from polling stations.  ""Whatever is being declared is a complete sham, we reject it and we dissociate ourselves with it,"" he said on Friday.  Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, promised to provide video evidence once the internet was restored.   Election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said ""the onus is on candidate Kyagulanyi to show how votes are rigged.""  On Friday late afternoon Wine told AFP he felt under threat as soldiers surrounded his home  ""They jumped over my fence. They came inside my compound. They are here right now. I don't know why they're here. But I'm imagining they are here to harm me. I feel threatened,"" said the 38-year-old, who described the invasion as unprecedented and ""a siege"".  The army's deputy spokesman Deo Akiiki said the soldiers were there to provide security and had stopped three people who tried to ""access the house"".  Police have advised people not to go out to celebrate or protest when results are announced citing draconian Covid-19 regulations which have regularly been used to crack down on the opposition.  - 35 years of Museveni -    Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote. He is one of Africa's longest serving leaders.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the median age is 16 and most have known only one president, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  Wine, with his humble origins in a slum and popular songs about economic and social injustice, struck a cord with the youth, but observers say the odds were stacked against him with Museveni's powerful grip on the state.  The election took place with no major internation observer mission aside from the African Union, with the United States saying too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the vote.  np-fb/lc","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Eight political parties were running, but the real contest lay between the MPLA and long-standing rival and ex-rebel movement the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  Pre-voting opinion polls suggested that support for the MPLA -- which won 61 percent of the vote in 2017 elections -- would dwindle, while  UNITA -- which has entered an electoral pact with two other parties -- would make gains.   But UNITA's inroads might not be enough to unseat Lourenco, 68, who succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago.  Dozens of voters lined up at polling stations in the early morning, but by midday they had slowed to a trickle.   Both leading candidates -- Lourenco at the capital's Lusiada University and Costa Junior in the working-class Nova Vida district -- called on the public to make their voices heard while casting their ballots.  Some stations started to close in the early evening about an hour before the scheduled time, AFP reporters said.    - 'Closer than ever' -    Costa Junior, 60, is popular among youth -- a significant and growing voting bloc -- and has pledged to ""eradicate poverty"" and create jobs.  Analyst Justin Pearce said the race looked ""very competitive"".  ""The further we've gotten from the civil war, the less currency... the MPLA has had,"" said the history lecturer at South Africa's Stellenbosch University.  ""The outcome looks like it's going to be closer than ever before.""   The MPLA traditionally wields a grip over the electoral process and state media in Angola, and opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering.   In the working-class district of Cazenga, 57-year-old Miguel said he would welcome the vote's outcome, whatever it was.  ""We have to accept the results, it's the democratic game,"" he said, without giving his surname.  But Alberto Bernardo Muxibo, another voter, disagreed.  ""We don't have a real democracy. The government oppresses the people,"" he said.    - Poverty and graft -    Lourenco, a Soviet-educated former general who promised a new era for Angola when he was first elected, is credited with making far-reaching reforms in one of southern Africa's economic powerhouses.  ""The West would not mind an MPLA victory -- even with concerns of vote rigging,"" said Johannesburg-based analyst Marisa Lourenco said.  ""Governments and companies abroad prefer stability over change"".  And little has changed for most of Angola's 33 million people, for whom life is a daily grind.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza also nurtured corruption and nepotism under dos Santos, who died in Spain last month.  The low-key, night-time repatriation of his remains in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre touch to the election.   Dos Santos will be buried on Sunday, which would have been his 80th birthday.  More than 14 million people were registered to vote across the vast southern African nation.  The United States commended Angola for holding a competitive vote.  ""Efforts to strengthen democratic institutions will provide a foundation for a safe, prosperous, healthy and inclusive future,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.  bur-sn/ub-giv/ah/bp","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

The European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell meanwhile told reporters in Spain that the bloc was considering military training for Ukraine's forces.  General Valeriy Zaluzhny, Ukraine's commander-in-chief, said Ukraine's children needed particular attention ""because their fathers have gone to the front and are maybe among the nearly 9,000 heroes who have been killed"".  Zaluzhny's comments on the Ukrainian death toll, reported by Interfax-Ukraine news agency, was the first indication of Kyiv's military losses since April.  On Wednesday, Ukraine will mark its independence day -- and six months since Russian troops invaded.  After Ukrainian resistance thwarted an early Russian push on the capital Kyiv, Moscow's forces have focussed on gaining ground in the east of the country.  The shockwaves of the war are being felt around the world with soaring energy prices and food shortages.    - Putin denounces 'vile crime' -    Russia's FSB security services on Monday accused Ukraine of being behind Saturday's car bombing in the outskirts of Moscow that killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of hard-line Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin.  ""The crime was prepared and committed by Ukrainian special services,"" the FSB said in a statement Monday carried by Russian news agencies.  Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the ""vile crime"" in a message of condolence to her family.  The FSB statement said the person responsible was a Ukrainian woman born in 1979 who had rented an apartment in the same building where Dugina lived.  After the car bombing, she had fled to EU member Estonia, it added.  Dugin, 60, is an outspoken Russian ultranationalist intellectual who enthusiastically backs Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as did his daughter. Russian media reports suggest Dugina had borrowed her father's car at the last minute.  Over the weekend, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak denied that Kyiv had had anything to do with the bombing.    - Tense Independence Day -    In Spain Borrell told reporters that EU defence ministers would next week discuss launching a major training operation for Ukrainian forces in nearby countries.  ""It seems reasonable that a war that is lasting and looks set to last requires an effort not only in terms of supplies of material,"" Borrell said.  EU defence ministers have a two-day meeting in Prague from next Monday.  ""I hope it will be approved,"" said Borrell, adding that the details would have to be agreed by all EU member states.  Any such operation would be a step up from the military training that several nations are already providing to Ukrainian forces under bilateral agreements.  With much of Europe preparing for fuel shortages as Moscow cuts back its deliveries to the west in response to sanctions, Bulgaria said Monday it was seeking talks with Russia gas giant Gazprom.  The country is almost totally dependent on Russia for its annual consumption of 3.0 billion cubic metres of natural gas.  ""We obviously have to turn to them,"" said Energy Minister Rosen Hristov.  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned over the weekend that Russia might mark Ukraine's Independence Day by launching a trial of Ukrainian soldiers captured during the siege of Mariupol.  ""This will be the line beyond which no negotiations are possible,"" he warned in Sunday's nightly address.  The capital Kyiv has already announced a ban on public gatherings around Wednesday's public holiday, and the city of Kharkiv, in the east, has declared a curfew.  Ahead of independence day, residents in Kyiv clambered on destroyed Russian tanks put on display in the city centre over the weekend.  bur-jj/gw   GAZPROM",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113565637']

The United States has learned ""that Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda"" in Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and ""particularly"" Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.  ""These referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks. In fact, we could see a Russian announcement of the first one or ones before the end of this week,"" he said.  ""Since they obviously are having trouble achieving geographic gains inside Ukraine, they are trying to gain that through false political means,"" he said.

Weeks after seizing control of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014, Moscow held a referendum that purportedly showed the local people wanted to join Russia.  Kirby said US intelligence says that Russian officials in the occupied areas are worried that local people will not turn out to take part in the vote.  To deal with that, the Russians are planning ""workarounds"" to demonstrate success, Kirby said, without providing any details.  ""The Russian officials themselves know that what they're doing will lack legitimacy, and it will not reflect the will of the people,"" he said.

Both fires broke out late Saturday, with more than 350 firefighters engaged against the wildfire in the northern Aragon region that has so far devastated an area of 6,000 hectares forcing at least 1,500 people from their homes.   But as they managed to steady the Aragon blaze after successfully preventing it from entering a protected nature reserve, the wildfire in the southeastern Valencia region continued to spread.   Hundreds of firefighters backed by 25 planes and helicopters were tackling the flames  in the Vall de Ebo,  50 kilometres (30 miles) north of the coastal resort of Benidorm.   So far, more than 6,500 hectares of land have been destroyed and more than 1,200 fled from their homes, with firefighting efforts complicated by strong winds in terrain that is difficult to access, the regional administration said.   ""It is a very complex fire and very complicated terrain. We evacuated more than 1,000 people yesterday and last night, we had to evacuate 70 or 80 more homes,"" regional emergency chief Jose Maria Angel told Cadena SER radio saying the fire's perimeter was ""progressively increasing"".  In the Aragon blaze, officials had feared the flames could reach the Moncayo nature reserve some 80 kilometres west of Zaragoza but that had been successfully  headed off, with official saying Monday the situation was ""evolving favourably"".   With the winds expected to drop during the day after a blustery weekend, civil protection officials said they were hopeful the stabilisation of the fire could see the 1,500 evacuees to return home.

They in turn increase the risk of fires, which emit climate-heating greenhouse gases.

Previous three-way talks have failed to produce an agreement on the filling and operation of the vast reservoir behind the 145-metre (475-foot) tall Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a hydropower project which broke ground in 2011.   On Sunday, the three countries held a new round of talks by video conference in the virtual presence of South African officials, as well as other international observers. South Africa currently holds the African Union's rotating chair.   ""The meeting concluded ... that this week will be devoted to bilateral talks between the three countries, the experts, and the observers,"" Sudan's water ministry said in a statement.   This week's talks will pave the way ""for the resumption of tripartite negotiations on Sunday January 10 in the hope of concluding by the end of January,"" it noted.    Ethiopia's water ministry expressed a ""positive outlook"" toward a draft document circulated among the three countries for negotiation, and that Sudan also supported the approach being taken.   Egypt ""categorically rejected the document"", the ministry said in a statement posted on Facebook.  Ethiopia said it had put forward alternative approaches for consideration by the other parties ahead of the next meeting.  ""Ethiopia is committed to conclude the negotiation with good faith to reach an agreement,"" the ministry said.    - Diplomatic strain -     Egypt, a country of more than 100 million people which depends on the Nile for about 97 percent of its irrigation and drinking water, opposes unilateral moves by Ethiopia, fearing its dam would severely cut its water share.  Last week, Ethiopia's foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti said Egypt knew ""the GERD won't harm them, it's a diversion from internal problems"".  The comments rankled Egypt's foreign ministry, which summoned Ethiopia's top diplomat in Cairo and issued a statement condemning the remarks as ""an attack on the Egyptian state"".  Sudan hopes the dam will help tackle flooding, but has also warned that millions of lives would be at ""great risk"" if no binding agreement was reached.  Both countries have called for a legally binding political solution to the dispute.    Ethiopia, the second most-populous country in Africa, says the hydroelectric power produced at the dam is vital to meet the power needs of its 110 million people.  ""Ethiopia will not agree to a GERD deal that will in any way restrict its right to use the Nile waters,"" the ministry said after Sunday's talks.  It insists downstream countries' water supplies will not be affected.  Ethiopia announced in July that it had reached its first-year target for filling the dam's massive reservoir, a move that sparked anxiety in Cairo and Khartoum.  The Nile, the world's longest river, is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to the 10 countries it traverses.  Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Niles, converge in the Sudanese capital Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea.      mz-np/ph/pvh     FACEBOOK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84030880']

To every member of Congress considering objecting to the election results, you cannot -- in light of this -- do so with a clean conscience,"" he tweeted.    - 'Contempt for democracy' -    Ahead of the release of the audio, Trump tweeted about the call, saying that Raffensperger ""was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the 'ballots under table' scam, ballot destruction, out of state 'voters', dead voters, and more.""  Raffensperger tweeted back, also ahead of the release of the audio, saying: ""Respectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out.""  After the release, the White House declined to comment.  Democrats were quick to condemn the call.  ""Trump's contempt for democracy is laid bare. Once again. On tape,"" Representative Adam Schiff said on Twitter.   ""Pressuring an election official to 'find' the votes so he can win is potentially criminal, and another flagrant abuse of power by a corrupt man who would be a despot, if we allowed him. We will not.""  Some political commentators compared the call to the Watergate tapes that led to the fall of past US president Richard Nixon.   Carl Bernstein, one of the reporters who helped bring down Nixon's presidency, called it ""the ultimate smoking gun tape.""  Trump has waged an all-out fight against the election results. But scores of recounts and lawsuits, as well as a review by his own Justice Department, have failed to substantiate the claims.  At one point, he invited Republican election officials from Michigan to the White House in an apparent effort to pressure them over their vote certification.   He also pressed Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, in a separate phone call.  Raffensperger and other election officials who have rejected Trump's entreaties, in Georgia and other states, have received death threats from his supporters.  It was not clear who released the tape, but under Georgia law, Raffensperger could legally have taped it without Trump's consent.  bbk/st/sst","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

Israel said it launched a pre-emptive strike against Islamic Jihad, killing a top commander of the Palestinian militant group it blames for a series of recent attacks inside Israel.   Islamic Jihad said the Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"", hours before it unleashed what it said was an ""initial response"" of more than 100 rockets towards Israel.  There were no immediate reports of casualties inside Israel, as officials in the country's commercial capital Tel Aviv said they were opening the city's bomb shelters.  But in Gaza, a child was among those killed, according to the territory's health ministry, which is run by Islamist movement Hamas.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, most recently in May of last year. Islamic Jihad is a separate group, but aligned with Hamas.   The Israeli strikes were ongoing late Friday, targeting what the army described as militant targets across the territory it has blockaded since the Hamas takeover.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said the strikes were a ""precise counter-terror operation against an immediate threat"".     - Five-year-old girl -    Flames poured out of a building in Gaza City following the first round of strikes, while wounded Palestinians were evacuated by medics.  Gaza's health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among nine people killed. A further 55 Palestinians were wounded, the ministry said.  Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Islamic Jihad said several members of its military wing were among those killed, including ""the great fighter Taysir al-Jabari 'Abu Mahmoud', the commander of the Al-Quds Brigade in the northern region of the Gaza Strip.""  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.  US ambassador Tom Nides said Washington ""firmly believes that Israel has a right to protect itself"".   ""We are engaging with different parties and urge all sides for calm,"" he wrote on Twitter.  UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was ""deeply concerned"", warning that the escalation was ""very dangerous"".    - 'Pay the price' -    The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, which has a strong presence in Gaza. The militant group did not launch attacks on Israeli territory after the arrests.  Gaza City resident Abdullah al-Arayshi said the situation was ""very tense"". ""The country is ravaged. We've had enough of wars. Our generation has lost its future,"" he told AFP.  Hamas, the militant group which rules Gaza, said Israel has ""committed a new crime for which it must pay the price"".  ""The resistance in all its military arms and factions is united in this struggle and will speak loudly... All fronts must open fire on the enemy,"" it said in a statement.  Lapid, who was meeting with his security chiefs through the day, said: ""Anyone who tries to harm Israel should know -- we will find you.""  Islamic Jihad is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by the European Union and the United States.  The office of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said the Israeli military action amounted to a ""dangerous escalation"" and called on the international community to curb Israeli ""aggression.""  The Israeli military banned large gatherings in communities within 80 kilometres (50 miles) of the Gaza frontier until Saturday evening.   The measure follows four days of road closures and other restrictions in the border area.  Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.  Gaza's only power station is at risk of imminent outage due to a lack of fuel supplies through Israel, its manager warned on Thursday.  This week's shutdown of the border area follows a raid by security forces in the northern West Bank district of Jenin.  Israeli forces detained Bassem al-Saadi and another senior member of Islamic Jihad. A 17-year-old member of the group was shot dead by Israeli forces during the raid.  bur-rsc/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN were among outlets reporting that Zawahiri was the target of what the White House announced was a ""successful"" operation against a top-level target in Afghanistan.  Biden was to deliver a televised address on the operation at 2330 GMT.  Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run for 20 years since the 9/11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in the United States.  He took over Al-Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.   A senior US official said the US had carried out a ""successful"" operation against a ""significant"" Al-Qaeda target in Afghanistan over the weekend.  It would be the first known over-the-horizon strike by the United States on an Al-Qaeda target in Afghanistan since American forces withdrew from the country on August 31, 2021.   US officials did not clarify where in Afghanistan the strike took place.   On Saturday morning the Afghan interior ministry denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike in Kabul, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in the capital, causing no casualties.  Early Tuesday in Kabul, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out on a residence in the Sherpur area of the city.  ""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first. The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones,"" his tweet said.  In recent months the Taliban have largely barred media from covering the aftermath of security incidents and frequently deny or downplay any casualties.  The news comes a week before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the control of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces over the preceding two decades.  The US withdrew after the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke their ties with Al-Qaeda.    - Doctor turned jihadist    Zawahiri, 71, lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world, but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.  He was believed to be the main strategist -- the real mastermind who steered operations, including the September 11 attacks, as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.  Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.  He became involved with Egypt's radical Muslim community at a young age and published several books on Islamic fundamentalism, which came for many to symbolize the radical Islamist movement.  He left Egypt in the mid-1980s and headed for Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar where the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based.  It was at that time, when thousands of Islamist fighters flooded into Afghanistan during the 1980s, that Zawahiri and bin Laden met.  In the early 1990s Zawahiri is believed to have lived in Europe before joining bin Laden in Sudan or Afghanistan.  In 1998 he was one of five signatories to bin Laden's ""fatwa"" calling for attacks against Americans and he began appearing regularly at the Al-Qaeda leader's side.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']

""In keeping with my campaign promise, my administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room,"" Biden said in a statement issued less than three months before midterm congressional elections, where the issue is seen as a vote winner for Democrats.  The proposed debt relief falls far short of some Democrats' goal of securing complete forgiveness, but is opposed by Republicans who argue that shaving any amount from graduates' loans is unfair to those who have spent years saving to pay off their own debts.  US colleges can often cost anywhere between $10,000 and $70,000 a year, leaving graduates with crushing debt as they enter the workforce. According to government estimates, the average debt for US college students when they graduate is $25,000, a sum many spend years or even decades to pay back.  In total, some 45 million borrowers nationwide owe a collective $1.6 trillion, according to the White House.  Under the relief plan, $10,000 will be cut from all loans owed by people earning a salary of less than $125,000. For former students who went to university with need-based government assistance known as Pell grants, the relief will be $20,000.  Meanwhile, a moratorium on loan repayments that was instituted during the Covid pandemic will be extended to the end of the year, with installments restarting on December 31.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112811646']

She said they would discuss their ""important relationship,"" and the Biden administration's decision to halt further construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline between Canada and the United States.  Trudeau said he was ""disappointed"" by the move, which came shortly after Biden took office.  ""While we welcome the president's commitment to fight climate change, we are disappointed but acknowledge the President's decision to fulfill his election campaign promise on Keystone XL,"" Trudeau said in a statement.

Pelosi, 80, faced a scare when five fellow Democrats defected and voted ""present"" or for someone else during the floor vote.  But the woman who is third in line to the presidency secured her fourth -- and perhaps final -- non-consecutive term as House speaker by earning 216 votes versus 209 for Republican leader Kevin McCarthy.  In a symbolic gesture beginning the 117th Congress, McCarthy formally handed the speaker's gavel over to Pelosi, who raised it in triumph as Democrats cheered and applauded.  ""We begin the new Congress during a time of extraordinary difficulty,"" Pelosi told the chamber, noting the toll of 350,000 dead and 20 million infected by Covid-19.  ""Our most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus,"" a masked Pelosi said. ""And defeat it, we will.""  The vote took hours, as lawmakers were required to vote in groups of several dozen due to social distancing rules imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.  Pelosi has been Trump's chief nemesis in Congress, and the two clashed bitterly over the past two years, particularly as she leveled impeachment charges against the president.  Trump was impeached in December 2019, but the Senate acquitted him early in 2020. His successor, Joe Biden, takes office on January 20.  With Pelosi scrambling to keep her post, it was a handful of progressive lawmakers and members-elect who have been critical of her leadership but ultimately voted for her on Sunday.  Among them was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most high-profile Democrats in Washington, and incoming lawmaker Cori Bush, who is the first African-American woman to represent Missouri in Congress.  There are normally 435 members of the House, but just 427 votes were cast Sunday as a few congressmen-elect are in quarantine due to Covid-19 and a tight House race in New York has yet to be formally decided.  One congressman-elect from Louisiana, Luke Letlow, died of complications from Covid-19 last week, days before he was due to be sworn in.  That leaves Democrats with one of the slimmest House majorities in two decades, 222 to 211 with two vacancies, as they navigate the remaining few weeks of Trump and carry into the Biden presidency.  On a day that was anything but conventional, Republican Chip Roy interrupted the swearing-in process to ask that the delegations from the six swing states where Trump has contested the election results not be seated Sunday as House members.

Zawahiri's assassination is the biggest blow to Al-Qaeda since US special forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, and calls into question the Taliban's promise not to harbour militant groups.  It was the first known over-the-horizon strike by the US on a target in Afghanistan since Washington withdrew its forces from the country on August 31 last year, days after the Taliban swept back to power.  The Taliban condemned the drone strike Tuesday, but made no mention of casualties nor did they name Zawahiri.  ""Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said in a sombre televised address, adding he hoped Zawahiri's death would bring ""closure"" to families of the 3,000 people killed in the US on September 11, 2001.  Zawahiri was believed to be the mastermind who steered Al-Qaeda's operations -- including the 9/11 attacks -- as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.  A senior administration official said the 71-year-old Egyptian was on the balcony of a three-storey house in the Afghan capital when targeted with two Hellfire missiles after dawn Sunday.  ""We identified Zawahiri on multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony where he was ultimately struck,"" the official said.   The house is in Sherpur, one of Kabul's most affluent neighbourhoods, with several villas occupied by high-ranking Taliban officials and commanders.  The Taliban's interior ministry previously denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in Kabul, causing no casualties.  Early Tuesday, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out.  ""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first,"" he said.  ""The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones.""    - 'Grossly violated' -    Although Biden did not mention the Taliban in his televised address, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""by hosting and sheltering"" Zawahiri, the Islamist group had ""grossly violated the Doha Agreement"" which paved the way for America's withdrawal.  Zabihullah, in turn, accused Washington of breaking the 2020 deal.  ""Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan, and the region,"" he said.  Zawahiri, who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run since the 9/11 attacks.  He took over Al-Qaeda after bin Laden was killed, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.  News of his death comes a month before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the hands of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces for two decades.  Under the Doha deal, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke ties with Al-Qaeda.  ""What we know is that the senior Haqqani Taliban were aware of his presence in Kabul,"" the senior US official said.   Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani also heads the feared Haqqani Network, a brutal subset of the Taliban blamed for some of the worst violence of the past 20 years and which has been described by US officials as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence.  In Sherpur, locals told AFP they long thought the targeted house  -- surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, and now with green tarpaulin covering the balcony where Zawahiri was believed to have been killed -- was empty.  ""We have not seen anybody living there for almost a year,"" said an employee of a nearby office.  ""It has always been in dark, with not a single bulb lit.""  Some residents found it hard to believe that Zawahiri had been hiding in their midst.  ""It's just propaganda,"" Fahim Shah, 66, told AFP.  ""They should show to the people and to the world that 'we had hit this man and here is the evidence,'"" added Abdul Kabir.    - Doctor turned jihadist -    Zawahiri lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.  Still, the group is believed to have been degraded since the US invasion of Afghanistan, and the White House official said Zawahiri was ""one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of significance"".  The organisation is ""at a crossroads"", said Soufan Center researcher Colin Clarke.   ""Despite Zawahiri's leadership, which minimised AQ's losses while rebuilding, the group still faces serious challenges going forward. For one, there's the question of who will lead Al-Qaeda after Zawahiri's gone.""  Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.

Jihadist monitor SITE said some militants were questioning the veracity of the report he had been killed, while others believed Zawahiri had achieved his desire of ""martyrdom.""  Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid welcomed the news of his killing.  ""Terrorist groups and their sponsors must know: You're living on borrowed time.

The latest issue -- which involves a fraction of the Boeing 777s in service -- resulted in grounding of some planes worldwide. However, the situation has major differences from the crisis over the 737 MAX, which was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes.    - What happened? -    A United Airlines flight bound for Hawaii quickly returned to Denver soon after takeoff Saturday after one of the engines caught fire and began breaking apart, scattering debris over a nearby suburb.  The incident badly shook passengers, but nobody was harmed -- a huge difference from the two tragic crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines MAX planes that together claimed 346 lives and led to the aircraft being banned from the skies for 20 months.   In the aftermath of the Denver incident, US and Japanese aviation authorities grounded the planes, and Britain banned them from its airspace.  In addition, about a half dozen carriers around the world removed from service 69 planes that had the same Pratt & Whitney PW 4000 engine involved in the incident.  Federal Aviation Administrator Steve Dickson ordered ""immediate or stepped-up"" inspections on 777 planes with the same engines.    - What is the nature of the problem? -    Investigations are ongoing, but Dickson said the probe would center on ""hollow fan blades"" unique to these Pratt & Whitney engines. The vast majority of the more than 1,600 777 aircraft that have been delivered over the years do not have this type of engine.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which also is investigating the incident, said an initial examination showed two fan blades were fractured.  Michel Merluzeau, an expert at consultancy AIR, said the problem with the engine could stem from an issue with metallurgy, fabrication, maintenance or operations.  ""It's not really a problem for Boeing,"" he said. ""It's more an issue of maintenance -- how United or Pratt & Whitney is maintaining engines that have been in use for a while.""  Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia said the inspection probably would only require a matter of days, but even so airlines may not rush to return the jets to service because of the overcapacity of widebody planes and the Covid-19 pandemic.    - How will the incident affect Boeing's business? -    Again the situation differs from the MAX, which had been Boeing's most popular plane. The lengthy grounding meant Boeing could not deliver aircraft during that period, badly denting revenues.  By contrast, the 777 models have been in service for years, and Pratt & Whitney has not manufactured this engine for 15 years, Aboulafia said.  Moreover, ""after all those years of service, it is unlikely to be a design issue with the engine,"" said Aboulafia, adding that the problem seems to lie with maintenance.    - What does this latest issue say about Boeing? -    While the particulars of this 777 problem do not appear to relate to Boeing's manufacturing, the issue comes at a ""bad moment"" for the aviation giant, Merluzeau said.  Besides the MAX debacle, Boeing's deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner were delayed after problems were unearthed during inspections. Boeing also pushed back the timing for its new 777X amid the downturn in commercial plane travel.  Boeing's operational problems in recent years dwarf those at rival Airbus, which also is struggling with reduced plane demand amid the coronavirus.  Merluzeau expects a major rethink of Boeing production systems in the coming years, with ""big changes"" in plane development and manufacturing.  jum-jmb/hs",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

The updated count from health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory said six children were among those killed since the start of the ""Israeli aggression"" on Friday, in addition to 204 people injured.  But Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket from Islamic Jihad militants had been responsible for the death of multiple children in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Saturday.   It was not immediately clear how many children were killed in the incident in Jabalia. An AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at an area hospital, including three minors.    The violence is the worst in Gaza since a war last year that devastated the impoverished territory -- home to some 2.3 million Palestinians -- and forced countless Israelis to seek shelter from rockets.   Israel's military has warned its latest aerial and artillery campaign against Islamic Jihad could last a week, but Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Cairo was talking ""around the clock"" with both sides to ease the violence.    Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, as the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza.  The head of the army's operations directorate, Oded Basiok, said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"" by Israel's campaign.    That includes Taysir al-Jabari, a top militant commander killed in Gaza City on Friday, and Khaled Mansour, who Islamic Jihad confirmed died in a strike in Rafah, southern Gaza on Saturday.   A total of eight people were killed in the Rafah strike, including a 14-year-old, according to Gaza's interior ministry.    Daily life in the strip has come to a standstill, while the electricity distributor said the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said the next few hours will be ""crucial and difficult"", warning it risked suspending vital services within 72 hours as a result of the lack of electricity.  - 'We are all alone' -    In Gaza City, resident Dounia Ismail said Palestinians had become accustomed to preparing a ""survival bag"" of items such as money and medicine.  ""This latest escalation brings back images of fear, anxiety, and the feeling that we are all alone,"" she told AFP.  Civilians in southern and central Israel, meanwhile, have been forced into air raid shelters since Friday.  The Magen David Adom emergency service said two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others were lightly hurt while running for safety.  In Kibbutz Nahal Oz, an Israeli community beside the Gaza border, resident Nadav Peretz said he had been ""in the bomb shelter or around it"" since Friday.   ""We recognise that on the other side too there is an uninvolved civilian population, and on both sides children deserve to enjoy their summer vacation,"" the 40-year-old said.    - Jerusalem -    Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. Both are blacklisted as terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare-up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that conflict.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.  Focus will in part turn to Jerusalem on Sunday, where some Jews will mark the Tisha Be'av remembrance day by visiting the holy city's most sensitive religious site, the Al Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.   Tensions at the compound in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem have previously sparked wider violence, and Hamas's Doha-based chief Ismail Haniyeh has warned against allowing Jews to ""storm"" the compound on Sunday, saying it could lead to an ""uncontrollable"" security crisis given events in Gaza.    Extreme-right Israeli politician Itamar Ben Gvir is scheduled to visit the compound on Sunday morning.   bur-bs/smw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The first in-competition film to stream for remote attendees of the prestigious indie festival, it drew immediate rave reviews, with Variety calling it ""tender, lively, funny, and beautifully stirring,"" and Deadline praising a ""breakout performance"" from Jones (""Locke & Key."")  ""I would say it's the equivalent of a standing ovation,"" Sundance programming director Kim Yutani told the cast as she hosted an online Q&A immediately after its streaming premiere ended.

Adopted in 1967, the 25th Amendment lays out the provisions for a transfer of power from a US president who dies, resigns, is removed from office or for other reasons is unable to fulfill his or her duties.  So far it has only been invoked for presidents undergoing a surgical procedure so that power could be shifted temporarily to the vice president.  In October of last year, there was talk of Trump possibly invoking the amendment when he became ill with Covid-19, but in the end he took no such action.  Now, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is leading appeals for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the amendment in the waning days of Trump's term, which ends January 20.  Schumer and others in and out of government are speaking out after Wednesday's shocking scenes in which an angry and armed mob egged on by Trump overran security at the US Capitol, rampaging for hours and disrupting a proceeding in which Congress ultimately certified that Joe Biden beat Trump in the November 3 election and will be America's next president.   ""What happened at the US Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""This president should not hold office one day longer.""  ""If the Vice President and the Cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,"" Schumer said.  US lawmakers had begun to address the question of power transfer from the chief executive in the late 1950s amid the ill health of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  It took on added urgency following the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the 25th Amendment was passed by Congress in 1965 and ratified by the required three-fourths of the 50 US states two years later.  Section 3 of the 25th Amendment addresses the transfer of presidential powers to the vice president when the chief executive declares that he or she is unable to fulfill the powers and duties of the office.  Section 4 addresses a situation in which the vice president and a majority of the cabinet determine that the president is no longer able to discharge their duties. This section has never been invoked.    - Invoked on three occasions -    Section 3 has been invoked three times.  The first was in July 1985 when President Ronald Reagan underwent surgery under general anesthesia for removal of a cancerous polyp from his large intestine.  Vice President George H.W. Bush was made acting president for about eight hours while Reagan was in surgery.   President George W. Bush temporarily transferred power to Vice President Dick Cheney in June 2002 and in July 2007 while he underwent routine colonoscopies under anesthesia.  Following Reagan's serious wounding in a 1981 assassination attempt, a letter invoking Section 3 was drafted but it was never sent.  Under Section 3, the president informs the president pro tempore, or presiding officer, of the Senate -- currently Republican Chuck Grassley -- and the speaker of the House of Representatives, currently Democrat Nancy Pelosi -- in writing that he is unable to discharge the duties of the office and is temporarily transferring power to the vice president.  Under Section 4, the vice president and a majority of the members of the cabinet inform the leaders of the Senate and House that the president is incapable of discharging his duties and the vice president becomes acting president.  ""It's time to evoke the 25th Amendment and end this nightmare,"" Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said after Wednesday's mayhem in Washington.  ""The president is unfit. And the president is unwell,"" he added.  If a president contests the determination that he or she is unable to fulfill their duties, it is up to Congress to make the decision.  A two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate would be needed to declare the president unfit to remain in office.  Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe has claimed that former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein raised the possibility of invoking Section 4 against Trump after he abruptly fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017.  But Rosenstein has denied the allegation.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104705419']

Kansans rejected an amendment that would have scrapped language in the state constitution guaranteeing the right to the procedure and could have paved the way for stricter regulations or a ban.  The vote was widely seen as a test case for abortion rights nationwide, as Republican-dominated legislatures rush to impose strict bans on the procedure following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Pro-abortion rights campaigners and supporters celebrated the win for their side of the hotly contested US debate.  ""I'm just beside myself,"" campaign volunteer Anne Melia told AFP.  When polls closed at 7:00 pm (0000 GMT), Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab said turnout was as high as 50 percent on this referendum, local media reported, a number usually expected for a general election.  Poll worker Marsha Barrett said some 250 voters had come to a station in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe by noon -- the same number it might see all day in a presidential election.   ""This election is crazy,"" Barrett told AFP. ""People are determined to vote.""  President Joe Biden also hailed the result. ""Tonight, Kansans used their voices to protect women's right to choose and access reproductive health care,"" he said on Twitter.  ""It's an important victory for Kansas, but also for every American who believes that women should be able to make their own health decisions without government interference.""  In a separate statement, he urged Congress to ""listen to the will of the American people"" and pass a bill codifying the right to abortion.  Other states including California and Kentucky are set to vote on the hot-button issue in November, at the same time as Congressional midterm elections in which both Republicans and Democrats hope to use it to mobilize their supporters nationwide.    - 'Remarkable' result -    In Kansas, the ballot centered on a 2019 ruling by the state's supreme court that guarantees access to abortion.   In response, the Republican-dominated state legislature introduced an amendment known as ""Value Them Both"" that would have scrapped the constitutional right -- with the stated aim of handing regulation of the procedure back to lawmakers.  In the opposing camp, activists said the campaign was a barely masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban -- one state legislator had already introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest or the mother's life.   For Ashley All, spokeswoman for pro-abortion rights campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the result of Tuesday's referendum was ""remarkable.""  ""Kansans understood that this amendment would mandate government control over private medical decisions,"" she said.   But voter Sylvia Brantley, 60, told AFP earlier in the day she voted in favor of the change because she believes ""babies matter, too.""  She said she wanted to see more regulations, in the hope that ""Kansas will not be a marketplace for killing babies.""  Activists complained that the phrasing of the ballot question was counterintuitive and potentially confusing: voting ""Yes"" to the amendment meant abortion rights would be curbed, while people who wished to keep those rights intact had to vote ""No.""     - All eyes on Kansas -    While abortion rights advocates in Kansas could breathe a sigh of relief in their own state, they still are looking nervously to neighboring Oklahoma and Missouri, which are among at least eight states to have passed near-total bans -- the latter making no exceptions for rape or incest -- while Midwestern Indiana adopted its own rigid ban on Saturday.  Kansas Governor Laura Kelly tweeted her support for the amendment's rejection.   ""Kansans stood up for fundamental rights today,"" the Democrat said.   ""We rejected divisive legislation that jeopardized our economic future & put women's health care access at risk.""  One voter in the town of Prairie Village, who declined to give her name, said she struggled to decide which way to vote.   ""I've gone back and forth the whole time,"" she told AFP, saying she ultimately chose to vote ""no.""  ""I feel like women should have a choice, but I also don't want full-term babies aborted,"" she said.   The outcome in Kansas means that abortion will remain permitted up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.  Kansas leans heavily toward the Republican Party, which favors stricter abortion regulations, but a 2021 survey from Fort Hays State University found that fewer than 20 percent of Kansas respondents agreed that abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest.  caw/to",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113334565']

The Zaporizhzhia plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- has been occupied by Russian troops in southern Ukraine since the opening weeks of the war, and remained on the frontlines ever since.  Recently Moscow and Kyiv have traded blame for shelling around the complex, a ""highly volatile"" development the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says ""underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"".  The development came on a day when Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to increase the headcount of his country's army to more than two million, including 1.15 million servicemen, from next January, according to the document published on a government portal.   Putin last set the army headcount in 2017 at around 1.9 million people with 1.01 million soldiers.  Ukraine state operator Energoatom said the Zaporizhzhia plant was severed from the national network after a power line was twice disconnected by ash pit fires in an adjacent thermal power plant.  The three other power lines ""were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks"" by Russian forces, the operator said.  ""The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) from the power grid -- the first in the history of the plant,"" Energoatom added on Telegram.  It added that ""start-up operations are under way to connect one of the reactors to the network"".  Kyiv officials have said they believe Moscow has seized the station in order to divert power to the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.  Energoatom could not be immediately reached for comment on whether the supply had been diverted, the cause of the ash pit fires, or the number of those without electricity.  However, the mayor of the city of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov said ""Russian occupiers cut off the electricity in almost all occupied settlements of Zaporizhzhia"".  Earlier on Thursday Britain's defence ministry said satellite imagery from the weekend ""indicated that Russia maintained an enhanced military presence at the site"".  ""The principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors' cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure,"" the ministry added in a statement.    - Independence day deaths -    Meanwhile on Thursday the death toll from an air strike on a train station in central Ukraine rose to 25, as the EU warned those ""responsible for Russian rocket terror will be held accountable"".  Russia issued a counter-claim saying it targeted soldiers and killed 200 Ukrainian servicemen in the attack Wednesday on a rail hub in Chaplyne city of the Dnipropetrovsk region.   The attack struck six months to the day since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine and also on the day Ukraine celebrated its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union.  On Thursday, state rail operator Ukrainian Railways said the toll had risen overnight from 22 to 25, and included two children with a further 31 people injured.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had warned at the weekend Russia might do something ""particularly cruel"" to mark Ukraine's independence celebrations.  In a daily press briefing, the defence ministry said the train was ""en route to combat zones"" in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, which Russia seeks to fully control.  But EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell ""strongly"" condemned ""another heinous attack by Russia on civilians"".  ""Those responsible for Russian rocket terror will be held accountable,"" he said on Twitter.  The UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown said the strike ""is just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine"".  ""In the six months since Russia's invasion, Ukrainians have continued to see their loved ones killed, injured and traumatized, their families separated, and their homes, schools and hospitals attacked,"" she said in a statement.  Meanwhile in Kyiv the city council renamed 102 streets in part of an ongoing effort to ""de-Russify"" public spaces.  Historic soviet and Russian road names have been replaced with titles lauding Ukrainian culture and commemorating patriots who have fought for the nation over the past six months.  bur-jts/cdw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Rushdie was air-lifted to the hospital following the attack that occurred just before 11:00 am local time, Major Eugene Staniszewski of the New York state police told journalists.   Police did not provide details of the prominent figure's condition beyond that he was still in surgery.  They identified the suspect in custody as Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old from Fairfield, New Jersey. A probable motive remained unclear.  Police said Rushdie was stabbed in the neck as well as the abdomen. A number of people rushed to the stage and took the suspect to the ground, before a trooper present at the event arrested him.  A doctor in the audience administered medical care until emergency first responders arrived. An interviewer onstage, 73-year-old Ralph Henry Reese, suffered a facial injury but has been released from the hospital, police said.   The attack occurred at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo city.  Carl LeVan, an American University politics professor attending the event, told AFP he saw the suspect run onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and ""stabbed him repeatedly and viciously.""  LeVan, a Chautauqua regular, said the suspect ""was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued,"" adding that he believed the man ""was trying to kill"" Rushdie.

But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" brought attention beyond his imagination when it sparked a fatwa, or religious decree, calling for his death by Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of the Prophet Mohammed.  Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practicing Muslims and today identifies as an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head -- which remains today.  He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell his children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.    - An 'essential voice' -    Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"" -- which runs to more than 600 pages -- has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  ""Just hours before the attack, on Friday morning, Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face,"" Nossel said in a statement.   ""Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman, wishing him a full and speedy recovery. We hope and believe fervently that his essential voice cannot and will not be silenced.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

""A new era begins today,"" the veteran right-wing premier said during a rare visit this month to Nazareth, Israel's largest Arab city.  Netanyahu, threatened by a damaging split in his Likud party, has made several stops in a game-changing charm offensive toward Arab voters that some observers have found jarring.  He highlighted Israel's rapid novel coronavirus inoculation pace at a vaccination centre in Umm al-Fahm on January 1, while in Nazareth he promised investment and anti-crime initiatives and apologised for potentially offensive past remarks.  Arab Israelis -- Palestinians who stayed on their land following the Jewish state's creation in 1948, and their descendants -- make up about 20 percent of the country's roughly nine million people.  The community's growing political importance was evident in the last vote, in March 2020, when the mainly Arab Joint List alliance won an unprecedented 15 seats in the 120-member Knesset, forming a key part of the anti-Netanyahu bloc.  Netanyahu, a hardliner on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, has on several occasions in recent years condemned Arab Israelis and their political leaders as terrorism supporters and enemies of the Jewish state.  Experts described his new pitch to Arabs as a nuanced political manoeuvre aimed at boosting his own support while also sowing enough political chaos to discourage some Arabs from voting, thereby trimming the influence of his Arab rivals.  Netanyahu is seeking to ""win Arab votes but especially wants to weaken the Joint List"", Tel Aviv University political science professor Jamal Amal told AFP.    - Discrimination -    Among Netanyahu's long record of anti-Arab rhetoric, a statement from Israel's 2015 election stands out.  In a polling-day bid to energise right-wing voters, he warned that Arab Israelis were voting ""in droves"" and suggested left-wing groups had bussed Arab citizens to polling stations.  Then-US president Barack Obama accused Netanyahu of portraying Arab Israelis as ""an invading force"".  Arabs have long complained of discrimination by Israeli police, and insist their plight has worsened since Netanyahu returned to power in 2009.  The so-called Nation-State law passed in 2018 at Netanyahu's urging, which declared Israel as the ""national home of the Jewish people"", was widely perceived as legally downgrading Arabs as lesser citizens.  Despite that record, Netanyahu has often argued that his governments have invested heavily in minority communities and ""done more for Arabs than any other government"".  While some protesters in Nazareth attempted to shout Netanyahu down, the premier secured an endorsement from the city's mayor, Ali Salam.    - 'Breaking the polygraph' -    Netanyahu, known as the great survivor of Israeli politics, faces the daunting challenge of securing a 61-seat Knesset majority in Israel's March 23 election.  Multiple recent polls suggest that right-wing Likud defector Gideon Saar, who has formed his own New Hope party, could peel a substantial number of seats away from Netanyahu.  Saar has categorically ruled out joining a Netanyahu-led government.  The pledge, if true, could deliver a hammer blow to the premier, who failed to secure a majority in three elections since April 2019 when Likud was united behind him.  The fraught coalition he formed with his centrist rival Benny Gantz in May following the third inconclusive election collapsed last month.  Because of the Saar threat and the dangers posed by his upcoming corruption trial, Netanyahu has been forced to seek support in unfamiliar terrain, experts said.  The prime minister has reached out to Mansour Abbas, a lawmaker from the Joint List, who is at odds with the Arab alliance.  Political analyst Yoav Stern told AFP he believes Netanyahu's true strategy is ""to confuse Arab voters"" so they will ""tell themselves that all parties are equal and there is no reason to go and vote"".  Jafar Farah, who heads the Mossawa Center that works to defend Arab Israeli rights, said Netanyahu has decided to soften his anti-Arab rhetoric because he fears that energising Jewish nationalist sentiment could benefit his right-wing opponents.  Joint List member Ahmad Tibi, more bluntly, charged that underlying Netanyahu's bid to win over Arabs is a dishonesty that has defined the premier's political career.  ""If we gave Netanyahu a polygraph test,"" Tibi said, ""the machine would break because it wouldn't be able to cope with that many lies.""  mab-cgo/bs/fz   STERN GROEP",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

""A dead body was discovered in the landslide,"" police said without identifying the person.  The police statement said the discovery was made around 2:30 pm Friday as Norwegian crews supported by colleagues from Sweden continued search operations in the snow-covered terrain.

Now he is putting jabs in arms at Checkpoint Paris, a sexual health centre in the heart of the French capital dedicated to LGBT people.  Despite a shortage of people to administer shots, the vaccination campaign is gaining momentum in the Paris region, which has been the epicentre of France's outbreak.  France has the fifth-highest number of monkeypox cases worldwide -- nearly 2,000, the national health authorities said on Friday.  More than 95 percent of French monkeypox cases have been in men who have sex with men, a group that has been overwhelmingly affected the virus.  Before May, the virus was largely only seen in West and Central Africa.  But more than 18,000 monkeypox cases have been detected throughout the world outside Africa since, most of them in Europe, according to the World Health Organization.  On Monday, India reported the fourth death linked to the virus outside Africa. France's neighbour Spain recorded two deaths over the weekend.  The rising cases have piled pressure on authorities to roll out doses of a smallpox vaccine that has been found to protect against monkeypox.   - 'Hit hard by Covid' -    Amelie Verdier, the head of the Paris regional health agency, told AFP that 25 new monkeypox vaccination centres had opened in the region including the capital since July 8 -- including 18 in the city itself.  More than 8,000 injections had been administered in the region as of Friday, representing 70 percent of all vaccinations in France. Around 5,000 of those injections were carried out just last week.  While admitting that early logistical problems may have delayed the initial rollout, Verdier emphasised that there was now no problem in acquiring doses.  The issue has become finding people to put jabs in arms.  ""Health professionals have been very hard hit by the Covid crisis,"" she said.  Last week the French government said it would mobilise more people to help with vaccinations, including health students.  A lack of staff has meant Checkpoint Paris has not been able to meet the demand for monkeypox inoculations.  ""We were able to bring in temporary doctors but it is more difficult to recruit nurses,"" said the centre's head, Sebastien Denglos.  Huy, a GP from the northern suburbs of Paris, was one of those doctors.  ""I was already vaccinating against Covid in the 20th district of Paris, when I saw in a WhatsApp group that more people were needed for monkeypox,"" he said.  The help was welcomed at the centre, which also fears it will struggle to administer the necessary second dose in time due to staffing shortages.  However French health authorities have indicated that the 28-day time limit between the first and second doses may be extended.   Another timeline is almost up -- the great August evacuation from Paris for summer holidays.  Arnaud, 22, went to Checkpoint Paris on Thursday to make an appointment for a jab the following day.  ""I didn't want to stay isolated at home and spoil the little holiday I have,"" he said.  Once he is vaccinated, he hopes ""to be able to spend a summer in relative peace"".  The WHO has emphasised that vaccination will not give instant protection against monkeypox infection. That can take weeks.   ito-dl/gil",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q87920134']

On Sunday, Israel approved 780 new settler homes in the West Bank ahead of a March general election in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to face a fierce challenge from the right from pro-settler candidate Gideon Saar.  Peace Now said the government had now invited tenders for a further 2,112 units in the West Bank and 460 in east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope to make the capital of a future state.  It accused the government of a ""mad scramble to promote as much settlement activity as possible until the last minutes before the change of the administration in Washington"".  ""By doing so, Netanyahu is signalling to the incoming president that he has no intention of giving the new chapter in US-Israel relations even one day of grace, nor serious thought to how to plausibly resolve our conflict with the Palestinians,"" Peace Now said in a statement.  For the Palestinians, Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for president Mahmud Abbas, said the Israeli move was equivalent to a ""race to eliminate what remains of the two-state solution, while posing more and more obstacles to the new US administration.""  All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by much of the international community.   But Trump's administration, breaking with decades of US policy, declared in late 2019 that Washington no longer considered settlements as being in breach of international law.   Biden has indicated that his administration will restore Washington's pre-Trump policy of opposing settlement expansion.  But on Tuesday his nominee for secretary of state, said the incoming administration will not reverse Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  ""The only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,"" Antony Blinken said.    - Electioneering -    Beyond the change in Washington, experts say Netanyahu also has domestic political reasons for pushing settlement expansion.   Electioneering is intensifying ahead of Israel's March 23 vote, in which the country's longest-serving premier faces a new challenge from Saar, a prominent pro-settler voice who split with Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party late last year.   Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967 and has increasingly expanded the size and number of its settlements there, particularly under Netanyahu's leadership since 2009.  There are currently some 650,000 Jews living in east Jerusalem and the West Bank amid an estimated 3.1 million Palestinians.  Governments around the world see the settlements as one of the biggest obstacles to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   gl-cgo/jjm/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

The truce, which officially started at 11:30 pm (2030 GMT), aims to stem the worst fighting in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the Palestinian coastal territory.  But a flurry of strikes and rocket attacks took place in the run-up to the truce, with sirens sounding in southern Israel moments before and after the deadline.  In a statement sent three minutes after the ceasefire began, Israel's army said that ""in response to rockets fired toward Israeli territory, the (military) is currently striking a wide range of targets"" belonging to Islamic Jihad in Gaza.  In a subsequent statement, the army said its ""last"" strikes took place at 11:25 pm.  While both sides had agreed to the truce, each had warned the other that it would respond with force to any violence.  ""The situation is still very fragile, and I urge all parties to observe the ceasefire,"" UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said in statement.  - 'Respond strongly' -    Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation.  Buildings in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, while Israelis have been forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets.  Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid's office late Sunday thanked ""Egypt for its efforts"" as it agreed to the truce, but said it that ""if the ceasefire is violated"", Israel ""maintains the right to respond strongly"".  Islamic Jihad member Mohammad al-Hindi had already confirmed the militants had accepted the truce, but the group added in a statement that it too ""reserves the right to respond"" to any aggression.  In addition to the 44 people killed including 15 children, the Gaza health ministry said 360 people had been wounded in the Palestinian enclave, which is run by the Islamist group Hamas.  Israel insists several children in the territory have been killed by stray militant rockets.  Three people in Israel have been wounded by shrapnel, while 31 others have been lightly hurt, emergency services said.  Islamic Jihad's Hindi said the ceasefire deal ""contains Egypt's commitment to work towards the release of two prisoners"".  The pair were named as Bassem al-Saadi, a senior figure in the group's political wing who was recently arrested in the occupied West Bank, and Khalil Awawdeh, a militant also in Israeli detention.  - 'Terrifying' -    Gaza resident Nour Abu Sultan had said earlier Sunday that she was ""awaiting the declaration of the ceasefire on tenterhooks"".  ""We haven't slept for days (due to) heat and shelling and rockets, the sound of aircraft hovering above us... is terrifying,"" the 29-year-old said.  Dalia Harel, a resident in the Israeli town of Sderot close to the Gaza border, said she was ""disappointed"" at news of a truce despite her five children being ""traumatised"".  ""We're tired of having a military operation every year,"" she said. ""We need our military and political leaders to get it over with once and for all... we're not for war, but we can't go on like this.""  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict in May last year.  The Israeli army has said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"".  Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.  The army said it had struck over a hundred Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets and mortars, some of them falling short inside Gaza.  Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation Friday against Islamic Jihad, which it said was planning an imminent attack.  The army has killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south.  bur-pjm/lg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Here are some excerpts from his inaugural address.    - The election, and democracy -    This is America's day. This is democracy's day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve through a crucible for the ages. America has been tested anew, and America has risen to the challenge.  Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people, the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.  We've learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.     - The Congress attack -    Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.    - Covid and 'this dark winter' -    Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found the time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. (A) once in a century virus that silently stalks the country. It's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost, hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.  In the work ahead of us, we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.    We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.    - Racial justice -    A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.    We can deliver racial justice and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world.  I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart.    - A president for all America -    Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.    Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war.  To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America.  The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly, disagreement must not lead to disunion.    And I pledge this to you, I will be a president for all Americans. All Americans.  We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue. Rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.  We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility... because here's this thing about life: There's no accounting for what fate will deal you.     - Truth and lies -    We must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.  Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies, lies told for power and for profit.  And each of us has a duty and a responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Preliminary results published by the country's electoral commission gave the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) 52.08 percent of the vote with more than 86 percent of ballots counted.   The main opposition group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Adalberto Costa Junior, stood at 42.98 percent.  The leader of the winning party automatically ascends to the presidency in the oil-rich former Portuguese colony.  In his first reaction to the initial results, Costa Junior, 60, remained optimistic.  ""Don't let them steal our hope,"" he told supporters via his Facebook page.  Augusto Santana, a political analyst in Luanda, however said opposition parties -- specifically UNITA -- were already questioning the preliminary results.  ""There is this feeling something wrong should have happened for the MPLA to be winning at this point,"" he told AFP.  The ruling party, which won the previous 2017 polls with 61 percent of the vote, has seen a steady decline in support in recent peacetime elections.  In 2012 it romped to victory with 71.84 percent against UNITA's 18.66 percent.  In 2008, MPLA won with 81.64 percent.    - 'Always the same story' -    The MPLA has ruled Angola for nearly 50 years since the country gained independence in 1975, before a civil war erupted, lasting 27 years and claiming at least 500,000 lives.  Multi-party elections in Angola were introduced in 1992.  But the MPLA's Jose Eduardo dos Santos, first elected in 1979, remained in office until 2017, when Lourenco succeeded him for a first five-year term.  The latest election has been overshadowed by a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought, compounded by dos Santos' death last month in Spain.  ""MPLA leads the count,"" read state newspaper Jornal de Angola's front page on Thursday.  Residents in the oceanside capital Luanda reacted with mixed feelings to the preliminary results.  ""I voted for UNITA, and I do not believe in these results,"" said Jorge, a 40-year-old mechanic who did not give his surname, accusing the electoral commission of being in cahoots with the ruling party.  ""The country is not going to change, it's always the same story.""  Lourenco, a 68-year-old former general educated in the Soviet Union, is credited with far-reaching reforms since taking power.  These include boosting financial transparency and efficiency in parastatal organisations, fighting sweeping nepotism and corruption, and promoting business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors.

""I am happy, the MPLA has given young people opportunities, there is more work and transparency,"" said 27-year-old shopkeeper Madalena Antonio, commenting on the early results.   ""The government did what it could do. Things will get better.""  The MPLA has traditionally wielded control over the electoral process, and state media and opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering.  Results in past elections, including 2017, have been contested -- a process that can take several weeks.  UNITA's deputy leader Abel Chivukuvuku said earlier that the party's own tally showed it was ahead.  There is a ""clear provisional indication of a winning trend for UNITA in all provinces,"" he told a live streamed press conference late Wednesday.  More than 14 million people were registered to vote.  A team of observers from the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) declared the election to have been organised in ""accordance with international requirements"" and Angolan laws.

Courts around Russia started handing down short jail sentences to demonstrators arrested during nationwide opposition rallies last weekend, while the foreign ministry accused US diplomats of encouraging Russians to join the protests.  Navalny's aides urged his supporters to take to the streets again next Sunday ahead of a court case that could see Russia's most prominent Kremlin critic put behind bars for more than three years.  The 44-year-old campaigner was detained just over a week ago when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had been recuperating from exposure to a Soviet-designed toxin.  He called on his supporters in dozens of cities to rally last weekend and released a two-hour investigation into the palatial seaside property to spur allies to demonstrate.  The rallies saw a record number of arrests, and Putin on Monday denied having anything to do with the property in Navalny's video, which has now been watched 86 million times.  ""Nothing that is listed there as my property belongs to me or my close relatives, and never did,"" Putin said during a video call with Russian students.  Navalny's report -- his most-watched anti-corruption probe by far -- claims the property is worth $1.35 billion and features everything from an underground ice rink to a casino.     - 'Terrorists' jibe -    Leonid Volkov, a key aide to the Kremlin critic, urged Russians to take to the streets again on January 31 ""for Navalny's freedom, for freedom for all, and for justice"".  Saturday's rallies saw clashes between police and protesters, 3,700 of whom were detained according to the OVD-Info monitoring group.  Putin said on Monday that Russian citizens have the right to express themselves but that they must do so ""within the framework of the law"".  According to OVD-Info, by Monday morning more than 80 people have been handed short-term jail sentences over the protests while at least 15 criminal probes have been launched.  Putin also said minors should not be encouraged to join the rallies, referring to a claim repeated by authorities that the opposition had encouraged young people to protest.  ""That's what terrorists do. They put women and children in front of themselves,"" Putin said.  Political analyst Alexei Zakharov, who cited polls conducted at Moscow's rally, said on Facebook that demonstrators were on average 31-years-old, while only 10 percent of participants were 18 or younger.    - Tech firms take flak -    The Russian foreign ministry on Monday repeated claims that US diplomats had encouraged Russians to participate in the rallies, and said it had lodged a ""strong protest"" with the American ambassador.   That allegation followed earlier claims by the Kremlin that the US embassy was interfering in Russian affairs by publishing protest routes ahead of the rallies.  An embassy spokeswoman told AFP that it was ""routine practice"" for diplomatic missions to issue safety messages to their citizens abroad.  Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would probe American tech companies over ""interference"" related to the demonstrations.  Ahead of the rallies, Russia's media watchdog Roskomnadzor ordered social media platforms including YouTube and Instagram to delete calls for demonstrations posted on their platforms.    Navalny's arrest was met with widespread condemnation in the West, with the European Union saying it was considering new sanctions on Russia -- although EU ministers decided at a meeting Monday that this was ""premature"", according to one European diplomat.   EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is due to visit Moscow early next month and indicated that he will press the Kremlin on Navalny's arrest.  Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, meanwhile said people should not be detained ""solely for expressing their opinion"", highlighting the ""basic right"" of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.   acl/kjl   FACEBOOK    GOOGLE",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105137806']

The 38-year-old former popstar-turned-MP did not give details about his accusations, which contradicted the government's account that Thursday's vote had been largely peaceful.  The internet remained down for a third day as vote counting continued, with provisional results from 24 percent of polling stations giving President Yoweri Museveni an early lead of 65 percent while Wine trailed with 27 percent.  The capital Kampala was quiet and some businesses remained closed, while soldiers and police patrolled on foot the day after the election.  Full results are expected by Saturday afternoon.  Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, having ruled for almost four decades, and his main rival among 10 opposition candidates is Wine, whose popularity among a youthful population has rattled the former rebel leader.  Voting in Kampala took place under the oppressive security presence of soldiers and riot police in the streets and at polling stations.  The election followed of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and scores of deaths.  However election commission chief Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said the vote had gone off in a ""peaceful and tranquil manner"".  Police spokesman Fred Enanga said there had been ""no major cases of violence reported.""  But a senior foreign diplomat told AFP there had been sporadic incidents of violence and many irregularities but no sign of mass manipulation.     - Observers denied -    The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  Wine has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.  Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  He has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the median age is 16, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  But the 76-year-old -- one of Africa's longest serving leaders -- has never lost an election and observers expect this time around will be no different.  His opponents -- most visibly Wine, who spent much of the campaign in a bulletproof vest and combat helmet -- were arrested, blocked from rallying and dispersed with tear gas throughout the campaign.

""When I ended our military mission in Afghanistan almost a year ago, I made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan,"" Biden told the nation late Monday as he announced the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri.  ""I made a promise to the American people that we'd continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations... We've done just that.""  Announcing jihadist leader deaths has become a ritual -- both somber and highly political -- for presidents ever since the attacks of September 11, 2001.  Barack Obama's 2011 revelation of the daring operation to kill Osama bin Laden in his home in Pakistan electrified the nation. On hearing Obama, a skilled orator, people poured into the streets, chanting ""USA!""  Donald Trump took a different approach in 2019, using gory language to deliver news of a raid to kill Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi in Syria -- and to bolster his own strong man image.  ""He died like a dog,"" Trump said.  For Biden, the setting was inauspicious. Isolating from a case of rebound Covid-19, battered in the polls and facing the anniversary this month of the traumatic July 30, 2021, exit of US troops from Kabul, the Democrat is in a weak position.  In a nod to Covid ventilation measures, his speech was delivered from the noisy balcony of the Blue Room. As he touted American resilience, Washington police sirens wailed in the background.  Yet the timing of the speech could not have been better for a president seeking to change the narrative.  While steering clear of triumphalism, Biden noted that Zawahiri had been on the wanted list ""for years under presidents (George W.) Bush, Obama and Trump.""  The implication -- that the country is safe in Biden's hands -- was clear.  ""No matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out,"" Biden said.    - Afghan strategy debate -    Critics on the right and left see last year's US withdrawal from Kabul as a show of ineptitude that, in addition to being a humiliating spectacle, will make Afghanistan a hotbed of anti-American Islamic groups, similar to the time of 9/11.  Biden argues he had the courage to pull the plug on a failed war conducted by three previous presidents and that there simply was never going to be a neat ending to the debacle.  Dismissing skeptics, he also promised that American ""over the horizon"" capabilities meant there'd be no more need to risk US lives on the ground.  Now with the Zawahiri killing, Biden has a golden opportunity to say that he's been proved right.  Afghanistan ""can't be a launching pad against the United States,"" Biden said in his speech. ""This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can, and we'll always make good on the solemn pledge.""    - Downsides -    There was instant praise from even unlikely quarters, with the anchor on the often hostile Fox News' evening broadcast calling it ""President Biden's bin Laden moment"" and ""a huge, huge win for the US.""  Some experts, however, caution against the White House spin.  James Jeffrey, a former US ambassador to Iraq and now chair of the Wilson Center think tank's Middle East Program, applauded the demonstration of ""excellent intelligence, an operational strike capability and decisiveness.""  However, that expertise does not outweigh the ""chaos"" of last year's Afghan withdrawal, which Jeffrey blamed on poor coordination and Biden's ""handicapping"" of staff through his refusal to accept there could be any downsides to pulling out -- or to plan for them.  Nathan Sales, another former diplomat who works at the Atlantic Council, said Zawahiri's mere presence in Kabul was a failure for the United States, suggesting ""as feared, the Taliban is once more granting safe haven to the leaders of Al-Qaeda.""  And it's too early to say whether one spectacular drone strike ""can be replicated against other terrorist targets,"" he said.  ""Until we know more, we should resist the urge to see the strike as a vindication of 'over the horizon' counterterrorism.""  sms/sw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']

The negotiations raise hopes that Egypt could help broker a deal to end the worst fighting in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the impoverished coastal territory, home to some 2.3 million Palestinians.  An Egyptian security source said that Israel ""has accepted"" a ceasefire, adding that Cairo was waiting for the Palestinian response.  Nour Abu Sultan, who lives west of Gaza, said she was ""awaiting the declaration of the ceasefire on tenterhooks"".  ""We haven't slept for days (due to) heat and shelling and rockets, the sound of aircrafts hovering above us... is terrifying,"" the 29-year-old said.  Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation.  At least 31 Palestinians have been killed including six children, and 275 people have been wounded since Friday, health authorities said in the enclave where several buildings were reduced to rubble.  Two Israelis have been wounded by shrapnel, and others forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza.  Dalia Harel, a resident in the Israeli town of Sderot close to the Gaza border, said she was ""disappointed"" at news of a truce despite her five children being ""traumatised"".  ""We're tired of having a military operation every year,"" she said. ""We need our military and political leaders to get it over with once and for all... of course we're not for war, but we can't go on like this.""  A spokesman for Islamic Jihad -- an Iran-backed group designated as a terrorist organisation by several Western nations -- told AFP ""there is no agreement"" yet.  Musab al-Buraim listed the group's demands, including the release of senior leader Bassem al-Saadi, whose arrest in the occupied West Bank was announced by Israel on Tuesday.    - Wounded people 'every minute' -    Islamic Jihad extended its barrage earlier Sunday to fire two rockets targeting Jerusalem, but they were shot down by the army.  The Israeli army has said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"".  Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said  medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.  ""Every minute we receive injured people,"" he said earlier Sunday.  The health ministry in Gaza, run by the Islamist group Hamas, said 31 people had been killed.  But Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Gaza's northern Jabalia area on Saturday.  It was not immediately clear how many children were killed there, but an AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the local hospital including three minors.  ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   The army said it had struck 139 Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing over 600 rockets and mortars, but with more than a hundred of those projectiles falling short inside Gaza.  Amid the high tensions, Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.  Some Palestinians shouted ""God is greatest"" in response, and an AFP photographer was briefly detained by Israeli police, but commemorations passed off without major incident.    - Top militants killed -    Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation Friday against Islamic Jihad, which it said was planning an imminent attack.  The army has killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south.  Israel's Lapid called the killing of Mansour an ""extraordinary achievement"".  In southern and central Israel, civilians were forced into air raid shelters. Two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others lightly hurt while running for safety, the Magen David Adom emergency service said.  Hamas's response to the violence remains critical, with spokesman Fawzi Barhoum offering the group's support to Islamic Jihad on Sunday, but stopping short of saying they would take part.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.  bur-pjm-rsc/lg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

An interviewer onstage, 73-year-old Ralph Henry Reese, suffered a facial injury but has been released from the hospital, police said.   The attack occurred at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo city.  Carl LeVan, an American University politics professor attending the event, told AFP he saw the suspect run onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and ""stabbed him repeatedly and viciously.""  LeVan, a Chautauqua regular, said the suspect ""was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued,"" adding that he believed the man ""was trying to kill"" Rushdie.  ""There were gasps of horror and panic from the crowd,"" the professor said.  LeVan said witnessing the event had left him ""shaken,"" adding he considered Chautauqua a safe place of creative freedom.  ""To know that this happened here, and to see it -- it was horrific,"" he said. ""What I saw today was the essence of intolerance.""  Another witness, John Stein, told ABC that the assailant ""started stabbing on the right side of the head, of the neck. And there was blood... erupting.""    - A decade in hiding -    Rushdie, 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" brought attention beyond his imagination when it sparked a fatwa, or religious decree, calling for his death by Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of the Prophet Mohammed.  Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practicing Muslims and today identifies as an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head -- which remains today.  He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell his children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.  Global leaders voiced anger over the attack and support for Rushdie, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying the author ""embodied freedom"" and that ""his battle is ours, a universal one.""  British leader Boris Johnson meanwhile said he was ""appalled,"" sending thoughts to Rushdie's loved ones and praising the author for ""exercising a right we should never cease to defend.""    - An 'essential voice' -    Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"" -- which runs to more than 600 pages -- has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  ""Just hours before the attack, on Friday morning, Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face,"" Nossel said in a statement.   ""Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman, wishing him a full and speedy recovery. We hope and believe fervently that his essential voice cannot and will not be silenced.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Hadi Matar, 24, was arraigned in court in New York state, with prosecutors outlining how Rushdie had been stabbed approximately 10 times in what they described as a planned, premeditated assault.  After the on-stage attack on Friday, Rushdie had been helicoptered to hospital and underwent emergency surgery.  His agent Andrew Wylie had said the writer was on a ventilator and in danger of losing an eye, but in an update on Saturday he told the New York Times that Rushdie had started to talk again, suggesting his condition had improved.  Author of ""The Satanic Verses"" and ""Midnight's Children"", Rushdie had lived in hiding for years after Iran's first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his killing.   And while Friday's stabbing triggered international outrage, it also drew applause from Islamist hardliners in Iran and Pakistan.  President Joe Biden on Saturday called it a ""vicious"" attack and offered prayers for Rushdie's recovery.  ""Salman Rushdie -- with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced -- stands for essential, universal ideals. Truth. Courage. Resilience,"" Biden said in a statement.  Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon. Police provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.    - Effective death sentence -    The 75-year-old novelist had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran's then-supreme leader Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.  The fatwa followed the publication of the novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" which enraged some Muslims who said it was blasphemous for its portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.  In a recent interview with Germany's Stern magazine, Rushdie spoke of how, after so many years living with death threats, his life was ""getting back to normal.""  ""For whatever it was, eight or nine years, it was quite serious,"" he told a Stern correspondent in New York.  ""But ever since I've been living in America, since the year 2000, really there hasn't been a problem in all that time.""  Rushdie moved to New York in the early 2000s and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  Security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community near Buffalo.  Witnesses said Rushdie was seated on stage and preparing to speak when Matar sprang up from the audience and managed to stab him before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators.  Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.  An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there.   Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.  Matar was ""born and raised in the US,"" the head of the local municipality, Ali Qassem Tahfa, told AFP.    - Outrage -    ""The Satanic Verses"" and its author remain deeply inflammatory in Iran. When asked by AFP on Saturday, nobody in Tehran's main book market dared to openly condemn the stabbing.  ""I was very happy to hear the news,"" said Mehrab Bigdeli, a man in his 50s studying to become a Muslim cleric.  The message was similar in Iran's conservative media, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""  In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan, a party that has staged violent protests, said Rushdie ""deserved to be killed.""  Elsewhere there was shock and outrage.  British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack ""reprehensible"" and ""cowardly.""  Messages also flooded in from the literary world, with Rushdie's close friend Ian McEwan calling him an ""inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world.""  Rushdie was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel, ""Midnight's Children,"" in 1981, which won international praise for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But ""The Satanic Verses"", published in 1988, transformed his life. The resulting fatwa forced him into nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell even his children where he lived.  bur/bbk-sst/bfm/sw/ser   THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Pelosi, 80, faced a scare when five fellow Democrats defected and voted ""present"" or for someone else during the floor vote.  But the woman who is third in line to the presidency secured her fourth -- and perhaps final -- non-consecutive term as House speaker by earning 216 votes versus 209 for Republican leader Kevin McCarthy.  In a symbolic gesture, McCarthy formally handed over the gavel to Pelosi.  ""We begin the new Congress during a time of extraordinary difficulty,"" Pelosi told the chamber, noting the toll of 350,000 dead and 20 million infected by Covid-19.  ""Our most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus,"" a masked Pelosi said. ""And defeat it, we will.""  The vote took hours, as lawmakers were required to vote in groups of several dozen due to social distancing rules imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.  Pelosi has been Trump's chief nemesis in Congress, and the two clashed bitterly over the past two years, particularly as she leveled impeachment charges against the president.  Trump was impeached in December 2019, but the Senate acquitted him early in 2020. His successor, Joe Biden, takes office on January 20.  With Pelosi scrambling to keep her post, it was a handful of progressive lawmakers or members-elect who have been critical of her leadership but ultimately voted for her on Sunday.  Among them was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most high-profile Democrats in Washington, and incoming lawmaker Cori Bush, who is the first African-American woman to represent Missouri in Congress.  There are normally 435 seats in the House, but just 427 votes were cast Sunday as a few congressmen-elect are in quarantine due to Covid-19 and a tight House race in New York has yet to be formally decided.  One congressman-elect from Louisiana, Luke Letlow, died of complications from Covid-19 last week, days before he was due to be sworn in.

""I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the US-Israel alliance, to continue expanding peace between Israel and the Arab world and to confront common challenges, chief among them the threat posed by Iran,"" Netanyahu said.  The Israeli leader was speaking in a video congratulating Biden moments after he was sworn in as US president, replacing Donald Trump.  Netanyahu, who has referred to Trump as the ""best friend"" Israel has had in the White House, noted Wednesday that he had ""a warm personal friendship going back many decades"" with Biden.  Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said it was ""not sorry"" to see Trump depart, calling him ""the world's main source and sponsor of oppression, violence and extremism"" and partner in ""Israeli aggression"" against the Palestinians.  Biden ""must correct the wrong historical path of American policy which is oppressing our people,"" and end policies aiming at ""destroying the Palestinian cause"", said Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum.  The Palestinian presidency lashed out at Netanyahu, who on Sunday announced that Israel approved 780 new settler homes in the occupied West Bank, ahead of a March general election.  All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by much of the international community.  But Trump's administration, breaking with decades of US policy, declared in late 2019 that Washington no longer considered settlements as being in breach of international law.  ""Netanyahu is welcoming Biden with settlements,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, on Wednesday.  ""His only aim is to destroy the two-state solution.""  Under Trump, the United States also recognised Jerusalem as Israel's ""undivided"" capital and moved its embassy there, sparking Palestinian outrage.  ""We hope that the presence of Biden will be a chance to apply international law and resolve the conflict, establishing an independent Palestinian state and putting an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people,"" said Jibril Rajub, a senior official from Abbas' Fatah party.  Trump's administration also withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed tough new sanctions on the Islamic republic, Israel's arch foe.  Israel welcomed the moves and encouraged Europe to follow suit.  But Biden's nominee for Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said Tuesday the incoming administration was ready to return to the deal as long as Iran respects its commitments.  The Jewish state has also reached a series of normalisation agreements with its Arab neighbours under the Trump administration.  gl/par/dv",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

The head of the military junta, Assimi Goita, joined Russian diplomats at a ceremony for the handover of five L-39 and Sukhoi-25 jets and an Mi-24P helicopter.  The Soviet-era warplanes are the latest batch of deliveries under close ties that have been forged since the Sahel state underwent a coup in August 2020.  In a speech, Defence Minister Sadio Camara paid tribute to what he called Mali's ""win-win partnership with the Russian Federation"".  The new deliveries ""strengthen our reconnaissance and attack capabilities"", he said.  ""Today's ceremony is historic, both in kind and quality as well as in the volume of what you are handing over,"" Camara said.  ""We are just showing a part of (Russian arms deliveries), the rest of course is being used in operations as these ceremonies unfold.""  The regime has brought in Russian paramilitaries -- described by Bamako as military instructors but by Western nations as mercenaries -- to support the beleaguered armed forces.  Their deployment was a key factor in prompting France, Mali's former colonial power and traditional ally, to pull its military forces out of the country. The withdrawal is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.  Previous Russian arms deliveries disclosed this year have been two Mi-24P helicopters and surveillance radars, which was announced in April, and two helicopters and mobile radar systems in March.  The helicopters were Mi-35P attack aircraft, an export version of the Mi-24P, according to the specialist newsletter Africa Intelligence.  Four Mi-171 choppers, a model used for troop transport, arrived last October, according to the authorities.  There have been no details about the terms under which Mali has acquired the weapons.  One of the poorest nations in the world, Mali has been battered by a jihadist campaign that began in the north of the country in 2012.

On a frigid but sunny day at the very Capitol building that was assaulted on January 6, Biden swore the oath of office moments after Kamala Harris, who became America's first woman vice president, turning the page on Donald Trump's tumultuous four years.  ""Democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,"" Biden said before a National Mall that was virtually empty due to the ultra-tight security and a raging Covid-19 pandemic that he vowed to confront immediately.  ""We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility and we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes.""  ""Together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear, of unity, not division, of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healings and goodness.""  But Trump, who falsely said that he was cheated out of a second term and egged on his supporters before their rampage at the Capitol, broke 152 years of tradition by refusing to attend his successor's inauguration.  Biden appealed to Trump's supporters, pledging to listen to all sides after four years of deep polarization in which Trump belittled minority groups and tried to cast doubts on basic facts.  ""I will be a president for all Americans.""  But Biden confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as witnessed during Trump's presidency in the Capitol mob, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.  The United States faces ""a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat,"" Biden said.  ""Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear and demonization have long torn us apart.""    - Historic leadership -    At 78, Biden is the oldest president in US history and only the second Roman Catholic president.  Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history and the first person of color as the nation's number two.   She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever ""second gentleman"" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who lured the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers in a video that went viral.  Central Washington took on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat. The Supreme Court reported a bomb threat Wednesday morning.  With the general public essentially barred from attending due to the pandemic, Biden's audience at the National Mall instead was 200,000 flags planted to represent the absent crowds.  Biden nonetheless brought in star power -- absent four years ago with Trump. Lady Gaga, in a poofy dress that was Valentine red, sang the national anthem and Tom Hanks prepared for a televised evening appearance with the new president.  Jennifer Lopez sang a pop rendition of ""This Land is Your Land,"" often considered the unofficial US national anthem, ending it by exclaiming the words of the pledge of allegiance -- a nation that promises ""liberty and justice for all"" -- in Spanish.    - Immediate actions -    Biden, who was vice president under Barack Obama and first ran for president in 1987, plans to kick off his tenure with a flurry of 17 orders.  Officials said Biden will immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord and stop the US exit from the World Health Organization and set new paths on immigration, the environment, Covid-19 and the economy.  Biden, who has vowed a major escalation of vaccination against Covid, warned of a ""dark winter"" still ahead from the pandemic that has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the United States, more than in any other country.  ""We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus,"" Biden said.  ""We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation,"" he said, striking a new tone after Trump's mockery of mask-wearing and business closings meant to halt the virus.  Biden will also end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.  Many overseas leaders breathed a sigh of relief at the end of Trump's hawkish, go-it-alone presidency, with Biden's team pledging greater cooperation with the rest of the world.  With so many domestic challenges, Biden delved little in his inaugural address into foreign policy, a longtime passion for the former senator, but said: ""We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.""    - Trump vows to be back -      Trump left Washington before the inauguration, walking on a red carpet on the White House lawn with his wife Melania to the Marine One presidential helicopter, which flew near the inauguration-ready Capitol before heading to Andrews Air Force Base on Washington's outskirts.  ""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters in a campaign-style event before flying off for the last time in Air Force One en route to his Florida resort.  ""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.  Trump did not address Biden by name but, in a rare hint of graciousness, wished the next administration ""great luck and great success.""  A spokesman said Trump maintained one tradition by leaving a letter for Biden, although the contents were unknown.  Mike Pence, the outgoing vice president who clashed with Trump in his final days by acknowledging he could not overturn the election, attended the inauguration and was spotted laughing with Harris.  Also taking part were former presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and their wives -- including Hillary Clinton, for whom Biden's victory was especially sweet four years after her narrow, surprise defeat to Trump.  In one of his last acts before departing the White House, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentenced of 73 people including allies.  Among them was Steve Bannon, his influential former aide and promoter of right-wing populism who was charged with defrauding donors asked to contribute to building Trump's promised wall on the border with Mexico.  Trump also at the last minute ended a ban on his administration's officials serving as lobbyists -- an order he had issued with fanfare at the start of his presidency as he vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington.  bur-sct/ec",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Excavators and cranes were deployed across the devastated seaside city of Mamuju, where buildings were reduced to a tangled mass of twisted metal and chunks of concrete, including a hospital and the regional governor's office.  It was unclear how many people -- dead or alive -- could still be under mountains of debris in the aftermath of Friday's 6.2-magnitude quake.  ""The rain poses risks because damaged buildings could collapse if it gets too heavy...and aftershocks could move them too,"" said rescuer Octavianto.  Excavating debris too fast with heavy equipment could crush and kill any buried survivors, he added.  ""All the victims we've found so far were dead,"" said Octavianto, 37, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.  ""It is most likely any more victims are already dead if 24 hours has passed,"" he added.  Scores of rescuers combed through the destruction, filling body bags with corpses, while police on Sunday deployed a K-9 unit of sniffer dogs to help in the search at a badly damaged hospital.  ""We also use our own sense of smell to find possible victims,"" said rescuer Kustang Firman at the hospital scene.  ""If there's a strong scent (of decay), we'll focus on that spot.""  - 'Roaring sound' -    Most victims were found in Mamuju, but some were also recovered south of the city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province.  Friday's tremor triggered panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  ""We heard a roaring sound and the house started shaking,"" said survivor Jumardi, 50, from a shelter where he and six family members took refuge.  ""All I had in my mind was that I would die... Everyone was panicking.""  Authorities have not given a figure for how many survivors have been rescued.  A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.  Meanwhile, corpses were recovered from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.  - Running low on food, supplies -    Doctors treated patients with broken limbs and other injuries at a makeshift medical centre, set up outside the only hospital in Mamuju that survived relatively intact.  Wawan, who was buried under his house until neighbours pulled him to freedom, initially didn't want to go into a hospital to treat his broken foot, fearing another quake.  ""I was traumatised,"" the 27-year-old said.  ""But people convinced me that the doctors were treating patients outside the building, so I agreed to go.""  Thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with whole families.  They said they were running low on food, blankets and other aid, as emergency supplies were rushed to the hard-hit region.  Many survivors were unable to return to their destroyed homes, or were too scared to go back, fearing a tsunami sparked by aftershocks, common after strong earthquakes.  ""It's better to take shelter before something worse happens,"" said Mamuju resident Abdul Wahab, from inside a tent with his wife and four children, one of whom is just a baby.  Fearing an outbreak of coronavirus in the crowded camps, authorities were trying to separate high and low risk groups.  - Disaster-prone -    Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, has been hit by a series of natural disasters this week.  Landslides sparked by torrential rains killed at least 32 on Java island, while dozens are dead or missing after severe flooding pounded another part of Sulawesi and Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo.  Volcano Mount Semeru shot a plume of ash and debris some 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) into the sky Saturday night as bright red lava flowed down from its crater. There were no reports of casualties.  Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.  In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  And on December 26, 2004, a massive 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including 170,000 in Indonesia -- among the worst recorded disasters in history.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index led the charge, jumping 2.0 percent to end the day at 13,457.25, fueled in part by a huge gain Netflix shares following a strong earnings report.  The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 percent to close at 31,188.38, while the broad-based S&P 500 climbed 1.4 percent to 3,851.85.  Biden and his team have championed an aggressive economic relief package, winning kudos from investors eager to see the US economy rebound.  ""In general, this is a market that's growing optimistic that increased fiscal spending will boost the economy and lead to earnings growth,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.  Investors were among those sighing in relief that worries over fresh civil unrest did not come to pass, as the transition of power took place in the nation's capital that looked more like a military stronghold.  ""We all hoped for a peaceful transition of power and we got it,"" Hogan said.  Among individual companies, Netflix shot up 16.9 percent after it reported better-than-expected subscriber growth in the past quarter.  The streaming entertainment leader added some 8.5 million paid subscribers in the quarter to reach 203 million despite recent price hikes, its quarterly earning update showed.

Biden instructed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) earlier this month to take action to end the controversial ""Remain in Mexico"" program put in place by his predecessor Donald Trump.    It saw tens of thousands of non-Mexican asylum seekers -- mostly from Central America -- sent back over the border pending the outcome of their asylum applications, creating a humanitarian crisis in the area, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.   ""Beginning on February 19, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will begin phase one of a program to restore safe and orderly processing at the southwest border,"" the agency announced in a statement.  It said there are approximately 25,000 active cases still. Candidates will be tested first for the coronavirus, a senior DHS official who asked not to be identified told reporters.  At least 70,000 people were returned to Mexico under the agreement from January 2019, when the program began to be implemented, through December 2020, according to the NGO American Immigration Council.  US authorities emphasized that they are working closely with the Mexican government and with international organizations and NGOs at the border.    DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas, who is the first Latino and the first immigrant to head the department, stressed that Washington is committed to ""rebuilding a safe, orderly and humane immigration system.""    ""This latest action is another step in our commitment to reform immigration policies that do not align with our nation's values,"" Mayorkas said in a statement.    The program was part of Trump's hardline plan to fight illegal immigration, one of the hallmarks of his administration and which included efforts to build a border wall and the policy which separated children from thousands of migrant families.  After Biden took office on January 20, his administration announced that it would reverse the most controversial measures and created a task force to reunite families that remain separated, a policy his administration has termed a ""national shame.""     On the day Biden was inaugurated, the DHS announced the suspension of new registrations in the ""Remain in Mexico"" program and asked all those enrolled to stay where they are while waiting to be informed about their cases.   Washington said Friday that those waiting ""should not approach the border until instructed to do so.""   In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, at his press briefing, welcomed Biden's move.  Lopez Obrador said he hoped to discuss with Biden a work visa program for Mexicans and Central Americans.  ""Their presence as workers in the United States"" is vital to the US economy, Lopez Obrador said.  an/gm-mdl/dw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105493039']

Wednesday marks half a year since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, as well as the day the nation annually celebrates its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union.  During a surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital -- hounded by air raid sirens throughout the day -- Johnson said Putin had failed to account for the ""strong will of Ukrainians to resist"".  ""You defend your right to live in peace, in freedom, and that's why Ukraine will win,"" he said in front of reporters during the afternoon.  Johnson -- who has less than two weeks left in office -- warned against relaxing sanctions or normalising relations with Putin.   ""It is not the time to advance some flimsy plan for negotiation with someone that is simply not interested,"" he told a press conference with Zelensky.  The Ukrainian leader had issued his own defiant morning video address, declaring: ""We don't care what army you have, we only care about our land. We will fight for it until the end.""  Referring to Russia he vowed Ukraine ""will not try to find an understanding with terrorists"".  ""For us Ukraine is the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. ""All 25 regions, without any concession or compromise.""    - Fresh aid -    Meanwhile on Wednesday, the US announced $3 billion in fresh military aid.  The new tranche of American funding will help Kyiv acquire more weaponry, ammunition and other supplies for its armed forces, locked in a grinding war of attrition with Russian troops in the east and south with neither side advancing significantly in weeks.  Johnson also unveiled his own £54 million ($64 million) package of aid, including 2000 ""state-of-the-art drones"" as well as anti-tank munitions.  The White House announcement came as Washington warned Moscow could be planning a surge in strikes on civilian targets coinciding with Independence Day observations.  Gatherings have been banned in the capital Kyiv and Zelensky has urged citizens to be on guard against ""Russian terror"".  Nevertheless the leader and his wife marked a minute of silence for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and laid yellow and blue floral bouquets at a memorial in central Kyiv, the president's office said.    - European support -    Johnson's visit was accompanied by other messages of support from Ukraine's allies.  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres  called the anniversary of the start of Russia's war in Ukraine a ""sad and tragic milestone"".  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU has been standing with Ukraine ""from the very beginning"" and ""will be for as long as it takes"".  But in an absurd message, the authoritarian leader of Belarus -- which offered its territory as a staging ground for Russia's invasion -- gave congratulations to Ukraine on its Independence Day.  ""I am convinced that today's contradictions will not be able to destroy the centuries-old foundation of sincere good neighbourly ties between the peoples of our two countries,"" Alexander Lukashenko said.    - Muted anniversary -    In the early days and weeks of Russia's invasion, Kyiv was under siege by Russian troops which reached the suburbs of the capital.  Moscow's offensive quickly faltered, and its forces withdrew in late March to regroup for assaults on Ukraine's east and south.  But in the capital, Ukrainians were sombre about the anniversary after a half-year of death and destruction.   ""Six months, the peace of life has been broken in every family,"" Nina, an 80-year-old pensioner, said at Independence Square in central Kyiv, on Tuesday.  ""How much destruction, how many dead, how can we relate to it?"" she asked.  The capital city's administration said it would shut public service centres on Wednesday and Thursday, and shopping malls said they would close for the anniversary for safety concerns.   However in central Kyiv trailing crowds of people gathered in a surreal atmosphere to inspect dozens of disabled Russian tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles installed near the government quarter to showcase Ukraine's military prowess.  Cotton candy vendors plied trade to pedestrians, who peered down tank barrels and posed for selfies, draped in the Ukrainian flag.     - Threatened nuclear plant -    Meanwhile, discussions continued on how to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, occupied by Russian troops and threatened by shelling, which Moscow blames on Kyiv.  The two sides traded accusations at a Tuesday meeting of the UN Security Council on Zaporizhzhia, with Ukraine and its allies demanding Russia pull its troops out of the plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- and agree to a demilitarised zone.  Zelensky told the  Security Council Wednesday via video link that Russia ""should unconditionally stop nuclear blackmail"" and ""completely withdraw"" from the plant.  The Russian and French foreign ministers spoke on Tuesday by telephone about an expected visit to the plant by inspectors from UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), amid worries over the high risk of a radiation accident.  And on Wednesday the head of Russia's state nuclear energy agency met the IAEA chief to follow up on the expected inspection.  bur-jts/bp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Gorman was the youngest poet to recite at an inauguration, a role first given to Robert Frost by John F. Kennedy in 1961, after First Lady Jill Biden saw one of Gorman's readings and invited her to participate at the Capitol steps.  Gorman said that she had been writing a few lines a day but stayed awake at night out of a compulsion to complete her inauguration poem, ""The Hill We Climb,"" following the January 6 ransacking of the Capitol by supporters of then president Donald Trump who hoped to undo Biden's victory.  ""We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it / Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy,"" she recited.  ""And this effort very nearly succeeded / But while democracy can be periodically delayed, / It can never be permanently defeated.""  Gorman, who graduated from Harvard University last year, was the first to hold the role of national youth poet laureate by the Library of Congress and earlier held a similar honor in Los Angeles, where she has started a non-profit group to promote literacy.  She has previously written about the struggle for racial equality and the #MeToo movement against sexual assault.  Showing both composure and joy as she took the podium moments after Biden, Gorman opened her reading by speaking of how ""We the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president -- only to find herself reciting for one.""  Among her previous works, Gorman wrote ""Tyrants Fear the Poet"" to address the 2017 white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia -- an episode that Biden said motivated him to challenge Trump, who had said the crowd included ""very fine people on both sides.""  In an interview with National Public Radio, Gorman said that she grew up with a speech impediment in which she could not pronounce certain letters -- a trait she shares with Biden, who has been open about his struggles with stuttering.  Her reading triggered loud applause at the inauguration and an avalanche of praise on social media.  ""I have never been prouder to see another young woman rise!"" tweeted daytime television queen Oprah Winfrey, drawing a parallel to another celebrated writer, the late Maya Angelou, who read at Bill Clinton's first inauguration.  Joanne Liu, the former president of Doctors Without Borders, called Gorman's recitation ""the most inspiring 5:43 minutes for the longest time.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Alejandro Mayorkas, the Cuba-born immigrant chosen by Biden to lead the massive Homeland Security Department, told a Senate committee vetting his nomination that the government would roll back departing President Donald Trump's tough measures to seal the southern US border.  He said arriving migrants would be permitted to apply for asylum and have their cases reviewed -- a process the Trump administration virtually ended, with the effect of sharply reducing migrant entry into the country.  Under Biden, who takes office on Wednesday, ""There is a commitment to follow our asylum laws, to enforce our asylum laws,"" Mayorkas said.  ""That means to provide humanitarian relief for those individuals who qualify for it.""  But, he added, ""it will take time to build the infrastructure and capacity.""  Mayorkas could face his first challenge if approved with some 4,000 migrants who have been trying to reach the US-Mexico border from Honduras.  On Monday, security forces broke up the caravan which had amassed in the Guatemalan town of Vada Hondo and on Tuesday thousands were returned to Honduras on buses and trucks, halting their northward march.  Pressed on what he would do if they eventually reach the US border, Mayorkas said the asylum law would be applied.  ""This is not the first caravan, that has apparently approached the border over the last four years or ... over the last 12 years,"" he said.  ""When people present themselves at our border we apply the laws of our nation to determine whether they qualify for relief under our humanitarian laws, or whether they don't.""  ""If they do not qualify to remain in the United States, then they won't.""  Asked about other aspects of Trump's tough border control regime, Mayorkas said the Biden administration would halt building walls along the Mexico border.   But he said there was no decision on calls to tear down the barriers the Trump administration has already installed.  Biden ""has committed to stop construction of the border wall,"" he said.   Mayorkas, 61, is a former federal prosecutor who ran US immigration services and then was DHS deputy secretary during the Obama-Biden administration.  He oversaw the implementation of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, meant to offer a way to citizenship for millions of longtime US residents who entered the country illegally.  While Trump attempted to rule the program illegal, Biden is pledging to resuscitate it and to provide permanent citizenship to those who qualify under it.  If confirmed, Mayorkas said he did not envision radical changes to the sprawling, 240,000-strong DHS bureaucracy, whose mission is focused firstly on protecting the country from terror and cyber attacks and natural disasters.  Under Trump the department was heavily politicized and a number of key posts were left unfilled.  Mayorkas meanwhile rejected calls by some Democrats and rights groups to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which Trump has used for sweeping roundups and expulsions of undocumented immigrants already inside the country.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The election has been overshadowed by Angola's many woes -- a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought, compounded by the death of a former strongman president.  The People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which has ruled the oil-rich nation for nearly five decades, faced its most serious challenge since the first multiparty vote in 1992.  Eight political parties were running, but the real contest lay between the MPLA and its long-standing rival and ex-rebel movement the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  Pre-voting opinion polls suggested that support for the MPLA -- which won 61 percent of the vote in 2017 elections -- would dwindle, while the UNITA -- which has entered an electoral pact with two other parties -- would make gains.   But UNITA's inroads might not be enough to unseat Lourenco, 68, who succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago.  Dozens of voters lined up at polling stations in the early morning, but by midday they were just a trickle.   Both leading candidates -- Lourenco at the capital's Lusiada University and Costa Junior in the working-class Nova Vida district -- called on the public to make their voices heard while casting their ballots.  Some stations started to close in the early evening about an hour before the scheduled time, with no more would-be voters in sight, according to AFP reporters.    - 'Closer than ever' -    Costa Junior, 60, is popular among youth -- a significant and growing voting bloc -- and has pledged to ""eradicate poverty"" and create jobs.  Analyst Justin Pearce said the race looked ""very competitive"".  ""The further we've gotten from the civil war, the less currency... the MPLA has had,"" said the history lecturer at South Africa's Stellenbosch University.  ""The outcome looks like it's going to be closer than ever before.""   The MPLA traditionally wields a grip over the electoral process and state media in Angola, and opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering.   In the working-class district of Cazenga, 57-year-old Miguel said he would welcome the vote's outcome, whatever it was.  ""We have to accept the results, it's the democratic game,"" he said, without giving his surname.  But Alberto Bernardo Muxibo, another voter, disagreed.  ""We don't have a real democracy. The government oppresses the people,"" he said.    - Poverty and graft -    Lourenco, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised a new era for Angola when he was first elected, is credited with making far-reaching reforms in one of southern Africa's economic powerhouses.  ""The West would not mind an MPLA victory -- even with concerns of vote rigging,"" said Johannesburg-based analyst Marisa Lourenco said.  ""Governments and companies abroad prefer stability over change"".  But little has changed for most of Angola's 33 million people, for whom life is a daily grind.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza also nurtured corruption and nepotism under dos Santos, who died in Spain last month.  The low-key, night-time repatriation of his remains in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre touch to the election.   Dos Santos will be buried on Sunday, which would have been his 80th birthday.  Some 14.7 million people were registered to vote at 13,200 polling stations across the vast southern African nation.  Angolans living overseas were for the first time able to cast ballots from abroad.  Results are expected within a few days. In past elections, results have been contested, in a process that can take several weeks.  bur-sn/ub-giv/ah","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

Cetinje is the site of the country's former royal capital and lies in a mountainous valley that has largely stagnated economically in recent decades.    Residents were left in shock in the shooting's wake.   ""I can't believe that this happened in Cetinje and Montenegro. I do not know what to say, I am speechless. I do not know where this can lead us,"" said Cetinje resident Milorad Mitrovic to public broadcaster RTCG.  The incident comes as the country is in the full throes of its highly anticipated tourism high season following two years of the coronavirus pandemic.   With an unemployment rate of some 18 percent and an average monthly salary of under 520 euros ($533), Montenegro counts on tourism and the appeal of some 300 km of azure coastline to boost its revenues.

Deadly fires are not uncommon in Ukraine, where compliance with safety regulations is poorly enforced and ageing infrastructure is badly maintained.  In December 2019, a fire killed 16 people and injured 30 others at a higher education institution in the Black Sea city of Odessa.    The director was later arrested on charges of negligence.

Myanmar's military has clamped down on press freedoms since its coup last year, arresting reporters and photographers, as well as revoking broadcasting licences as the country plunged into chaos.  Toru Kubota, who was held while covering a protest in Yangon last week, ""has been charged under section 505 (a) and under immigration law 13-1"", the junta said in a statement.  505 (a) -- a law that criminalises encouraging dissent against the military and carries a maximum three-year jail term -- has been widely used in the crackdown on dissent.  Breaching immigration law 13-1 carries a maximum of five years in prison.  Filmmaker Kubota, 26, was detained near an anti-government rally in Yangon along with two Myanmar citizens.  After the charges were filed, he was transferred from police custody to Yangon's Insein prison, a security source told AFP, requesting anonymity.  ""He's in good health and embassy officials have visited him already at the police station where he has been detained,"" a security source told AFP.  According to a profile on FilmFreeway, he has previously made documentaries on Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority and ""refugees and ethnic issues in Myanmar"".  He is the fifth foreign journalist detained in Myanmar after US citizens Nathan Maung and Danny Fenster, Robert Bociaga of Poland and Yuki Kitazumi of Japan, who were all eventually freed and deported.  Fenster, who was held in May last year as he attempted to leave the country, faced a closed-door trial inside Insein on charges of unlawful association, incitement against the military and breaching visa rules.  He was sentenced to 11 years in prison before being pardoned and deported.  Tokyo has long-standing relations with the country's military and Japan is a top donor to Myanmar.  More than 2,100 people have been killed in the crackdown on dissent in Myanmar and almost 15,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group.  As of March this year, 48 journalists remain in custody across the country, according to monitoring group Reporting ASEAN.  Only China jailed more reporters than Myanmar last year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.  bur-rma/pdw/qan",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113435201']

So far, inspectors have so far been unable to say why the 26-year-old plane crashed just four minutes after takeoff, but they do know the location of the black boxes.  A recording of conversations with air traffic control pointed to routine exchanges, and there was no communication as the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged about 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) in less than a minute before slamming into the Java Sea, said National Transportation Safety Committee investigator Nurcahyo Utomo.  ""It's like a normal conversation and nothing suspicious,"" he told AFP.  ""There's no talk of an emergency or something like that.""  The preliminary data suggested it was ""most likely"" that the plane was intact when it hit the water Saturday, he added.  ""But we don't know at this stage"" what caused the crash, Utomo said.  His comments came as divers searched waters off Jakarta for black boxes -- cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- that could be crucial to help explain why the plane went down.    - Switched flight -    There were 62 Indonesian passengers and crew aboard the half-full flight, including 10 children.  The jet's captain, Afwan -- a 54-year-old father of three, who like many Indonesians goes by one name -- was a former air force pilot with decades of flying under his belt, according to local media.  Some of the 2,600 personnel working in the recovery effort involving dozens of boats and helicopters are hauling body parts, twisted piece of wreckage and passengers' clothing from shallow waters about 23 metres (75 feet) deep.  Body bags filled with human remains are being taken to a police hospital where investigators hope to identify victims by matching DNA from their remains to living relatives.  Rapin Akbar, who gave a blood sample to the hospital, had five relatives on board including an older sister, a nephew and his wife and their seven-month-old baby.  They were flying back to Pontianak, the city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes away.  ""(My nephew) had planned to go back to Pontianak on Sunday but changed his mind and decided to fly on Saturday instead,"" Akbar told AFP.  ""He called me to say the flight was delayed and sent me a picture of their baby. It was (their) first.""    - Black box data -    Despite the name, black boxes are usually bright orange with reflective stripes, and all commercial planes are obliged to have them on board.  Built to survive at vast depths and in extreme heat, they are fitted with a beacon which can emit a signal for one month.  The devices record information about the speed, altitude and direction of the plane as well as flight crew conversations.  Black box data help explain nearly 90 percent of all crashes, according to aviation experts.  The probe into Saturday's crash is likely to take months.  Aviation analysts said flight-tracking data showed the plane sharply deviated from its intended course before it went into a steep dive, with bad weather, pilot error and mechanical malfunction among the potential factors.  ""Something quite dramatic has happened after takeoff,"" said Stephen Wright, professor of aircraft systems at Finland's Tampere University.  ""The airspeed is far too low. The aircraft didn't accelerate up to the correct speeds for continuous flight.""    - Spotty safety record -    Sriwijaya Air, which flies to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said little about the plane, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.  The Indonesian carrier has not recorded a fatal crash since it started operations in 2003.  But the nation's fast-growing aviation sector has long been plagued by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.  That accident -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the accidents.   The 737 model that went down Saturday was first produced decades ago and was not a MAX variant.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.   A year later more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/rbu   BOEING    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

Russian missiles slammed into the town of 4,000 people, a railway hub in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, killing 25 people including two children and injuring 31, the presidency said Thursday.    ""An 11-year-old boy was killed under the rubble, another six-year-old died in a burnt-out car near the station,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy chief of the presidential administration, said on Telegram.    One of the missiles destroyed the house of Viktor's neighbour, leaving a huge crater in the courtyard.   Viktor, a grey-haired man in a blue polo shirt, was not at home but heard the explosions from afar.    ""My daughter phoned me to tell me what a nightmare has happened here. I came back by bike. The house next door didn't exist anymore. There was a hole five meters deep,"" he said.    The neighbour and her son were taken to hospital with injuries.   But locals knew there was still a second child under the rubble and began clearing it.   ""After, the rescuers arrived and we pulled him out,"" Viktor said.   ""We saw him every day, it was like he was our kid,"" he said.    Viktor's daughter and mother-in-law were at the scene at the time of the strike.   ""They were both in shock,"" Viktor's wife Kateryna said, breaking down in tears.   ""Thank God they stayed alive.""    The attack hit the railway station and ""five carriages caught fire,"" said Artem Zhuravlyov, an emergency services official.   Ukraine's state railway company said three of its employees were killed and four others injured and published photos of burnt passenger wagons.      - Independence Day -    The bombing came as Ukraine marked Independence Day, which commemorates its 1991 separation from the Soviet Union.   It also came as the country entered its seventh month of the Russian invasion on Wednesday.   Moscow said it had struck a ""military train"" heading for ""combat zones"" in eastern Ukraine, a key strategic objective of Moscow.   An Iskander missile ""directly hit a military train... eliminating more than 200 soldiers from the Ukrainian armed forces reserve"" as well as equipment, the Russian defence ministry said.   Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said ""10 civilians were killed"" at Chaplyne station and its surroundings, leaving open the possibility that the other victims were not civilians.

At least 46 people died after the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Friday, triggering panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  Search-and-rescue worked through the night as they pulled dozens of bodies from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of about 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province, where a hospital was flattened and a shopping mall lay in ruins.  Others were killed south of the city after the quake struck, as a strong aftershock jolted the area Saturday morning.  Grieving relatives began burying the dead at a local cemetery.  Planes and boats packed with food and other emergency supplies were arriving, with the navy reportedly sending a ship equipped with mobile medical services as Mamuju's still-standing hospitals were flooded with hundreds of injured.  Rescuers said a shortage of heavy equipment was slowing the search effort, while thousands left homeless by the quake set up makeshift shelters on higher ground -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents that were lashed by heavy downpours.  ""We're running out of food. There hasn't been any aid from the government yet,"" 24-year-old survivor Desti told AFP from hard-hit Majene, adding that some survivors at the camp needed medical attention.  ""Some people are using coconut leaves as mats,"" she added.  Many survivors are unable to return to their destroyed homes, or too scared to go back fearing more quakes or a tsunami, said Desti, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.  Authorities have not given a figure for the number of residents who could still be trapped under buildings reduced to twisted metal and concrete chunks, including the hospital that collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff inside.  On Saturday, authorities said they had pulled eight corpses from under the building, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.  Among the Mamuju survivors was a pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris. The pair are now being treated in hospital.    - 'Heartfelt solidarity' -    The Pope said he was ""saddened"" to learn of the quake.  ""His Holiness Pope Francis expresses his heartfelt solidarity with all those affected by this natural disaster,"" the Vatican said in a statement.  ""He prays for the repose of the deceased, the healing of the injured and the consolation of all who grieve.""  Landslides triggered by the heavy rains and quake blocked the main access road out of the seaside city, scuttling some residents' efforts to flee.  The city's airport had also been damaged, while the regional governor's office was also partly destroyed, authorities said.  Power remained out in parts of Mamuju after the quake damaged its electricity grid.  Save the Children warned that the young were among the most at risk.  ""While the extent of the earthquake damage is still unclear, we know children are often the most vulnerable following disaster,"" it said.  ""It will be essential that children are prioritised in any response, as they may have witnessed the death of loved ones or become separated from their parents.""  The quake's epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and it had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres.  In neighbouring Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo island, at least five people had died in heavy flooding while dozens more were missing, according to reports.  Indonesia, a sprawling Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.   In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.  bur-pb/je",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

More than 3,500 demonstrators were detained in protests across the country on Saturday, with several injured in clashes with police in Moscow, following Navalny's call to rally against President Vladimir Putin's 20-year rule.  The West has widely condemned the ""harsh tactics"" used against demonstrators, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian saying Sunday the mass arrests of protesters was ""an intolerable affront"" and a ""slide towards authoritarianism"".  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said the bloc would discuss ""next steps"" on Monday.  Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday accused the US embassy of interfering in Russia's domestic affairs after the mission distributed a ""demonstration alert"" to US citizens in Russia recommending they avoid protests.  ""Of course, these publications are inappropriate,"" Peskov told a state TV channel. ""And of course indirectly, they are absolutely an interference in our domestic affairs.""  A US mission spokeswoman said US embassies and consulates around the world routinely issue safety messages to US citizens.  ""This is a common, routine practice of many countries' diplomatic missions,"" she told AFP on Sunday.  The US embassy in Moscow on Saturday said that Washington supported ""the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression"".    - Protests in over 100 cities -    Peskov also accused protest organisers of seeking to ""rock the boat"" and said the number of people who had demonstrated paled in comparison to Putin supporters.  ""A lot of people vote for Putin,"" Peskov said, pointing to last year's constitutional plebiscite that allowed 68-year-old Putin to remain in power until 2036.  Navalny, Putin's most prominent critic, was arrested on returning to Moscow last weekend following months of treatment in Germany for a near-fatal poisoning with a Soviet-designed Novichok nerve agent.  He then called for Saturday's unauthorised protests, which took on an unprecedented geographic scale, spanning more than 100 cities.   Around 20,000 people protested in Moscow and more than 10,000 in Saint Petersburg, according to estimates from AFP journalists, with rallies also held in numerous countries including France and Lithuania.  Leonid Volkov, the head of Navalny's regional network, praised the turnout.  ""I am certainly proud, very impressed and inspired,"" Volkov told AFP. Navalny's team is hoping to stage another rally next weekend.  Many at the protests said they were angered by the findings of a Navalny investigation into an opulent Black Sea property allegedly owned by Putin.   The two-hour report, which claims that Putin owns ""the world's most expensive palace"" allegedly financed through a massive corruption scheme, has been viewed nearly 80 million times on YouTube.   Peskov said the luxury mansion on the Black Sea was ""private"" property and had nothing to do with Putin.    - Protester in intensive care -    Moscow officials said that 29 people received medical assistance in hospitals and were released, while a female protester in Saint Petersburg was in intensive care after a policeman kicked her in the stomach.  Saint Petersburg prosecutors said they were probing violations on ""the part of law enforcement"" and the use of force against a woman.  The statement was released after local media published a video showing a middle-aged woman falling to the ground after being kicked by riot police.  The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it has launched criminal inquiries in Moscow over the use of violence against law enforcement, hooliganism and property damage.  In a separate statement, investigators said a 36-year-old man was detained after hitting two policemen at the Saint Petersburg protest.  The OVD Info monitor said police seized at least 3,521 protesters, with 1,398 people detained in Moscow and 526 in Saint Petersburg.  The head of the Kremlin's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, said most of those detained in Moscow had been released.  He also defended the detentions, saying the protests were illegal and took place during a coronavirus pandemic. ""I see no violations whatsoever,"" he said.   Navalny, who rose to prominence a decade ago, accuses the FSB security agency of seeking to poison him on Putin's orders.   He is the target of several criminal probes and supporters fear authorities are planning to sentence him to a long prison term.  mak-as/dl   GOOGLE","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105008734', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105137806']"

Politician Yevgeny Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, was detained for ""discrediting"" the Russian army in comments about Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.    ""Roizman was arrested early in the morning"" at his home in Yekaterinburg, state news agency TASS said, quoting local law enforcement.   ""A criminal case has been launched against him for discrediting the Russian army,"" it added.  The charges are punishable by up to 10 years in jail.  A dozen armed police in camouflage on Wednesday burst into the 59-year-old's home, according to a video posted on the Mash Telegram channel, reputed to be close to the Russian security services.  A police source quoted by TASS said the investigation was launched because of a video criticising Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, published on the politician's YouTube channel.   Roizman has already been fined three times for criticising Russia's offensive in Ukraine.    The politician's lawyer Vladislav Idamzhapov was not allowed to enter his client's apartment where a search was underway, TASS said.   ""It is a violation of the right to defence,"" Idamzhapov was quoted as saying by TASS.   Opening his window for a few seconds, Roizman shouted to reporters gathered outside that he was being prosecuted for ""discrediting"" the army.  In a recent interview with AFP, Roizman said he has ""no illusions"" and understood that he could face arrest for his views.  ""But I also have no fear,"" he said.  Roizman was a lawmaker between 2003 and 2007. In 2013, he became Russia's highest-profile opposition mayor and held the position for five years.  Last year he was sentenced to nine days in jail for urging people to join demonstrations in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.

The special rapporteurs insisted such harassment must stop, and said residents continue to be threatened by the risk of forcible transfer, including mass forced evictions and arbitrary displacement.  ""Israeli authorities' hubris is proving without limits. They are even harassing human rights defenders and humanitarian workers seeking to support and protect people facing grave human rights violations in Masafer Yatta,"" the four experts said in a joint statement.  ""This is a direct assault on the core of human rights and international humanitarian law... this also confirms that impunity over abuse of power fosters power to abuse.""  The case of Masafer Yatta -- or Firing Zone 918 -- an agricultural area near Hebron, has been one of Israel's longest running legal battles.   In the early 1980s the army declared the 30-square-kilometre (12-square-mile) territory a restricted military area and claimed it was uninhabited.  Residents of eight villages had been in court for around 20 years fighting Israeli government efforts to evict them.  But in May this year, Israel's High Court approved the eviction of Palestinian villagers to make way for a military training zone.  ""The tragic implications of that decision are now before our eyes: roughly 1,200 Palestinian residents in Masafer Yatta are left defenceless in front of the threat of forced eviction and arbitrary displacement,"" said the experts, who do not speak for the United Nations but are mandated to report their findings to it.  The statement was penned by the special rapporteurs on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, adequate housing, internally displaced persons, and human rights defenders.  They voiced dismay at reports that human rights defenders and humanitarian workers have been harassed by the Israeli military in Masafer Yatta.

The experts expressed particular concern for Sami Hureini, a prominent human rights defender and member of the ""Youth of Sumud"" activist group ""engaged in peaceful resistance against illegal settlements in the southern Hebron hills"".  On June 28, he was reportedly arrested at a checkpoint in Masafer Yatta and detained by the military for several hours, the experts said.

Health authorities in the enclave controlled by Hamas Islamists said 10 people have been killed by Israel's bombardment, including a five-year-old girl, with 79 others injured. Israel's army estimated that its operation has killed 15 militants.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said the Jewish state was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive counter-terror operation against an immediate threat"" posed by the Islamic Jihad group, following days of tensions along the Gaza border.  Israel and Islamic Jihad have both confirmed the killing of a top leader with the militant group, Taysir al-Jabari, in a Friday strike on a building in the west of Gaza city.   Islamic Jihad said the initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"", before it unleashed a flurry of more than 100 rockets towards Israel.  The rocket fire and Israeli strikes continued overnight, risking a repeat of an 11-day conflict in May 2021 that devastated Gaza and forced countless Israelis to rush to bomb shelters.  ""Israel isn't interested in a wider conflict in Gaza, but will not shy away from one either,"" Lapid said in a nationally televised address.  Air raid sirens sounded overnight across several spots in southern and central Israel, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.   Officials in border areas urged people to stay close to shelters, which were also being opened in the commercial capital of Tel Aviv.  The army had initially confirmed at least 70 rocket launches from Gaza, saying 11 had fallen inside the strip, with dozens intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system, and that others had landed in open areas.  Air raid warnings and Israeli strikes had at least temporarily abated by 4:30 am (0130 GMT).  Egypt, a historic broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, was seeking to mediate and may host an Islamic Jihad delegation later Saturday, Egyptian officials told AFP in Gaza.    - Escalation, mediation -    Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May. Islamic Jihad is a separate group, aligned with Hamas, but that also acts independently.  A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor.  The sides exchanged fire for several days without Hamas joining the fray.  Hamas's moves amid the current violence could prove crucial in determining its severity, with the group facing pressure from some to maintain calm in order to improve economic conditions in the territory.  Gaza City resident Abdullah al-Arayshi said the situation was ""very tense"". ""The country is ravaged. We've had enough of wars. Our generation has lost its future,"" he told AFP.  Hamas said Israel has ""committed a new crime for which it must pay the price"".  Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.     - Five-year-old girl -    Flames poured out of a building in Gaza City following the first round of strikes, while wounded Palestinians were evacuated by medics.  Gaza's health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among nine people killed.   Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.   UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was ""deeply concerned"", warning that the escalation was ""very dangerous"".    - 'West Bank' -    The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel has been conducted a near relentless wave of raids inside the West Bank since mid-March in response to deadly attacks on Israeli citizens.   Islamic Jihad did not launch rockets after Saadi's arrest, but Israel has insisted through the week that the group was committed to seeking revenge.   Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.  bur-bs/mtp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Deputy President William Ruto and Raila Odinga, the veteran opposition leader now backed by the ruling party, have vowed to maintain calm following Tuesday's poll, but the memory of past election-related violence remains fresh for many Kenyans.  With pressure building on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), which has to declare the results by August 16, officials worked overnight to count votes under the watchful eye of observers.  The complicated process of verifying and tallying votes is expected to take days, and IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati urged Kenyans to be patient, keen to avoid rigging allegations that have haunted previous polls.  As results trickled out, Amnesty International and several Kenyan civil society groups voiced concern about ""rising levels of false or misleading information"" being shared on social media.  They said in a statement that several posts by candidates and their supporters in the rival Odinga and Ruto camps had ""intentionally sought to misinform the electorate and the public on the electoral process and the election results"".  Kenyans voted in a total of six elections on Tuesday, choosing a new president as well as senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  Despite an early show of enthusiasm with many voters queuing at polling stations before dawn, turnout was markedly lower than in previous years, suggesting that for some Kenyans at least, patience with the political establishment was running out.  In Ruto's Rift Valley stronghold of Eldoret, Anthony Kemboi, a 24-year-old graduate, told AFP voter disillusionment was to blame.  ""People did not turn out... as compared to the past because there have been fake promises"" over the years, he said.  According to the latest IEBC figures, turnout was just over 65 percent, with voting still under way in Wajir county, where a gunfight forced officials to postpone the poll until Wednesday.  That compares with a final turnout of 78 percent in the disputed August 2017 election.  In the lakeside city of Kisumu -- Odinga's bastion -- retired civil servant Koga Edward said younger Kenyans had simply failed to show up.  ""Most of our youth, they are only good at participating in political rallies, but they don't participate in the actual voting process,"" the 65-year-old told AFP.    - 'No longer care' -    ""Personally, I did not even vote because I no longer care,"" said Caroline Mwangi, a 31-year-old waitress in Kenya's capital Nairobi.  Politicians ""tell the same old stories and they do nothing for us,"" she said.  Others said they just wanted the election cycle to end so they could focus on putting food on the table in a country hit by skyrocketing inflation and an unemployment crisis.   ""The election was done yesterday, I am not interested in wasting more time on it,"" said Celestine Muoki, a 28-year-old IT specialist.  ""Let us move on.""  Gabrielle Lynch, professor of comparative politics at the University of Warwick in England, said the shrinking turnout was a consequence of politicians' tendency to ""promise a lot and then under-deliver"".  ""Many Kenyans are... becoming unfortunately increasingly sceptical about the political class,"" she told AFP.  Few Kenyans expect either Ruto or Odinga to accept the result without a challenge in a country where no presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002.  Once the heir-apparent, Ruto, 55, found himself banished to the sidelines after President Uhuru Kenyatta -- who cannot run again -- joined hands with his former foe Odinga, 77, in a move that stunned the country.  Ruto has since cast himself as the champion of ""hustlers"" trying to survive in a country ruled by ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.    - 'Life is very hard' -    With a third of Kenya's population living in poverty, economic pressures weighed on voters even before the war in Ukraine sent the prices of essential goods soaring.  Some observers surmised that the economy could even surpass tribal affiliations as a key motivator for Kenya's 22 million registered voters.  With two other candidates also in the race, Kenya could stage a run-off for the first time in its history, if neither Ruto nor Odinga wins more than 50 percent of the vote.  Kenya's international partners are closely watching the election as a test of its stability in a region blighted by conflict.  Security is tight nationwide, with a view to preventing a repeat of the post-election violence that roiled Kenya after the 2007 and 2017 polls, and schools have been ordered to remain closed until Monday.  In deserted downtown Nairobi, Japeth Kigongi, a 25-year-old shoe shiner, told AFP he couldn't even afford to travel to his home constituency to vote.  ""Life has become very hard,"" he said.

At least 46 people died after the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Friday, triggering panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  Body bags were filled with corpses hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province, where a hospital was flattened and a shopping mall lay in ruins.  Others were killed south of the city.  Grieving relatives began burying the dead Saturday and it remained unclear how many more victims could still be under mounds of twisted metal and chunks of concrete strewn across the seaside community.  Planes and boats packed with food and other emergency supplies flowed in, as the navy reportedly sent a ship equipped with mobile medical services to take pressure off Mamuju's still-standing hospitals, which have been flooded with hundreds of injured.  Rescuers said a shortage of heavy equipment was slowing the search effort.  Thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with families -- that were lashed by heavy downpours.  ""We're running out of food. There hasn't been any aid from the government yet,"" 24-year-old survivor Desti told AFP from hard-hit Majene.  ""Some people are using coconut leaves as mats,"" she added.  Many survivors are unable to return to their destroyed homes, or too scared to go back fearing more quakes or a tsunami.    - Covid control -    Worried about an outbreak of Covid-19 in the crowded camps, authorities said they are trying to separate high and lower-risk groups.  Mamuju resident Ice said he and his family were buried under rubble when they heard the voices of children searching for those still alive.  ""They were shouting 'Who's alive?' and after hearing that I said 'Yes, I'm alive' and then me and my family were able to crawl out from under the rubble,"" said the man, who sustained a broken arm.  James, a construction supply seller taking refuge at a bus depot, said he leapt from the second storey of his home just before the violent tremor flattened the building.  ""After shaking a few times, the house collapsed,"" he said, adding that his parents and sister also managed to escape.  A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.  But the news was more grim for many, as eight corpses were plucked from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.  ""It will be essential that children are prioritised in any response, as they may have witnessed the death of loved ones or become separated from their parents,"" NGO Save the Children said.    - 'Heartfelt solidarity' -    Pope Francis expressed his ""heartfelt solidarity"" with those affected by the disaster.  Landslides triggered by the heavy rains and quake blocked the main access road out of the seaside city, scuttling some residents' attempts to flee.  The city's airport had also been damaged, while the regional governor's office was also partly destroyed.  Power remained out in parts of Mamuju after the quake damaged its electricity grid.  The quake's epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and it had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres.  In neighbouring Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo island, at least five people had died in heavy flooding while dozens more were missing, according to reports.  Indonesia, a sprawling Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.  In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.  bur-pb/mtp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

Kenyans are praying for a peaceful transition of power after almost a decade under President Uhuru Kenyatta, but concerns about vote-rigging linger in a nation still haunted by previous election disputes that descended into deadly violence.  The vote is taking place as the country struggles with soaring prices for food and fuel, a punishing drought that has left millions hungry, and deep disenchantment with the political elite, particularly among young voters.  In the presidential race, the deputy president and erstwhile heir apparent William Ruto, 55, is pitted against Raila Odinga, the 77-year-old veteran opposition leader now backed by Kenyatta after a stunning shift in political allegiances.  Analysts have in recent days suggested that Odinga, a onetime political prisoner and former prime minister who is making his fifth bid for the top job, could edge past his younger rival.  But if neither wins more than 50 percent of the vote, Kenya would be forced to hold a run-off for the first time in its history.  Despite mudslinging and widespread disinformation, campaigning passed off largely peacefully in contrast to previous polls.  Pressure is now on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to ensure a free and fair vote in all six polls -- for the presidency as well as senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  But already, the election has run into some hitches, with six IEBC officials arrested on Monday and the commission suspending constituency or gubernatorial polls in several counties because of erroneous ballot papers.  IEBC head Wafula Chebukati vowed that the body would not hesitate to take ""stern action"" against any official flouting election laws.   ""Let us collectively rise up and show the world that Kenya is a vibrant democracy.""    - Beacon of stability -    Kenya's international partners are keenly watching the vote in a country considered a beacon of stability and democracy in a troubled region, with diplomats voicing cautious optimism it will pass off largely violence-free.  Both Ruto and Odinga have called for a peaceful vote, but fears remain that if the losing candidate challenges the outcome -- as widely expected -- the discord could erupt into street fighting.  Security is tight, with more than 150,000 officers ready to ensure the safety of the polls.  The trauma of the 2007 election, which was followed by a horrific bout of politically motivated ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,100 people, still looms large.  And Odinga's challenge to the 2017 election result that saw then foe Kenyatta re-elected was met with a heavy-handed police response which left dozens dead.  The Supreme Court ordered a re-run of the 2017 vote, citing widespread irregularities in the counting process and mismanagement by the IEBC.  No presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002, and there will be an anxious wait for this year's results which are not expected for several days.  ""Kenya votes, East Africa holds breath,"" was the headline in The East African regional newspaper.  With neither Ruto nor Odinga belonging to the dominant Kikuyu tribe, which has produced three of the country's four presidents, the election will open a new chapter in Kenya's history.  More than 22 million people have registered to vote out of a population of about 50 million and polling stations are open from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm (0300 GMT to 1400 GMT).    - 'Jobs, jobs, jobs' -    Ruto, whose party symbol is the wheelbarrow, has painted the election as a battle between the ordinary ""hustlers"" and the ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.  Some observers say economic pressures could compete with tribal allegiances as the key factor driving voter behaviour in a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.  ""The reshaped electoral chessboard means the outcome will probably come down to the degree to which Odinga and Ruto can muster support outside their respective bases,"" the International Crisis Group's East and Southern Africa analyst Meron Elias said in a note.  Lawyers David Mwaure and George Wajackoyah -- the latter an eccentric former spy who wants to legalise marijuana -- are also running but are likely to trail far behind the frontrunners.  If Odinga wins, his running mate Martha Karua would become deputy president, the first woman to hold the post.  Both candidates have vowed to get the economy back on its feet, rein in Kenya's mammoth $70 billion debt mountain and tackle the corruption that infects every level of society.  Already hit hard by the Covid pandemic that threw hundreds of thousands out of work, Kenyans are battling soaring inflation as the Ukraine war sends prices of basic necessities spiralling.  ""I want them all (the politicians) to accept the election so the country can continue in peace,"" said Grace Kawira, a 32-year-old unemployed mother of two at Ruto's final campaign rally.

Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, saying the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza.  Health authorities in the Palestinian enclave, which is controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said a five-year-old girl was among 15 people killed in the Israeli bombardment, adding that more than 120 have been wounded.  Civilians meanwhile took refuge in air raid shelters on the Israeli side, with AFP journalists hearing sirens warning of incoming fire in the Tel Aviv area on Saturday evening.  Israel's ongoing strikes are being met with barrages of rockets from the Palestinian side, stoking fears of a repeat of an 11-day conflict that devastated Gaza in May 2021.   Daily life in the enclave has come to a standstill, while the electricity distributor said the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said the next few hours will be ""crucial and difficult"", warning it risked suspending vital services within 72 hours as a result of the lack of electricity.  There have been no reports of Israelis wounded by rockets, though officials said a home was hit and land was set ablaze by income fire near the border.    - Hamas's crucial decision -    An Israeli military spokesman said its forces were ""preparing for the operation to last a week,"" and told AFP that the army is ""not currently holding ceasefire negotiations"".  Islamic Jihad's leader in Gaza, Mohammed al-Hindi, said: ""The battle is still at its beginning.""  Israel and Islamic Jihad confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key commander of the militant group, in a Friday strike.  Jamal al-Fadi, a political science professor at Gaza's Al-Azhar University, said he expected the violence to end ""within days"".  ""Islamic Jihad is reacting in a limited manner and by doing so is preventing the occupation (Israeli military) from intensifying its air strikes,"" he told AFP.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. Both are blacklisted as terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare-up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that conflict.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial.  Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, said Hamas currently has an interest in staying on the sidelines as it has recently won more economic aid for Gazans.   ""But if more civilians are killed, then it will feel obligated to respond,"" she told AFP.    - Five-year-old girl -    Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza City's main hospital, said medics are facing ""acute shortages of medical supplies"".   The UN humanitarian chief for the occupied Palestinian territories, Lynn Hastings, urged the warring sides to allow ""fuel, food, and medical supplies"" to be delivered to Gaza amid the worsening crisis.  On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl"" was among those killed by Israeli fire.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said Friday ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  The Gaza strikes followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people in the West Bank it said were members of the group.   Israel has conducted a wave of often deadly raids inside West Bank towns and cities since mid-March in response to lethal attacks on Israelis.  bur-rsc/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Kirby, who also described China's actions as ""provocative,"" did not say which officials met with the ambassador.  ""We condemned the PRC's military actions, which are irresponsible, at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability and across the Taiwan Strait,"" he said, referring to China by its official acronym for the People's Republic of China.

It leaves it to the two sides to work out a solution, while opposing any use of force to change the status quo.   Beijing insists that Taiwan is a part of China awaiting reunification, by force if necessary. Taiwan's current ruling party has vowed to defend the island's sovereignty.

Ignoring stark warnings from Beijing, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived late Tuesday in Taiwan -- the highest-ranking elected US official to visit the island in 25 years -- sparking a diplomatic firestorm.   China on Thursday launched some of its largest-ever military drills in response -- exercises set to disrupt one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.   But on Xiamen's palm-fringed beach, on the west side of the 200-kilometre-wide strait that separates Taiwan from mainland China, there is little concern.   ""A war? No, I don't care,"" a young IT worker surnamed Hwang tells AFP as he takes a lunchtime stroll.   ""As residents of Fujian, we're used to tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We've lived with them for decades,"" he adds, referencing the frequent flare-ups between the two rivals since the 1950s.    China's eastern Fujian province lies just across the sea from Taiwan, and the two share cultural ties as well as a common Chinese dialect.     - 'We aren't worried' -     ""Something could happen at any moment. But the probability is low, so we aren't worried,"" says Hwang.   ""But Pelosi's visit breaks the balance that there was.""   Unfazed by the news, young newlyweds smile for photos, people walk their dogs, and children play in the sand.    ""I think and I hope there won't be a war,"" Zheng Dahai, a 30-year-old who brought his son to set up a tent on the beach and have a bite to eat, tells AFP.   ""A conflict would have repercussions on us, our lives, there might even be injuries,"" he says.   Behind him, six kilometres offshore, is the island of Kinmen, home to just over 100,000 people.   In a twist of history, Chinese communist forces have never managed to conquer the island, meaning it remains under Taiwan's control.  This makes this beach one of the few places where the military forces of the mainland and the island face each other at such a short distance.   If a war were to break out, this would be ground zero.     - Reunification 'sooner or later' -    ""We don't want war. We want to live in peace and mutual respect,"" says a retiree who comes here to swim every day, including in winter.   ""On the other hand, if you don't respect me, if you come to bully me, then that's another story. If the other is strong or not, even me, an old man, I will fight!""   Further away, two tourists take a selfie in front of a monument emblematic of Xiamen's unique location: eight Chinese characters, several metres high, that form a patriotic slogan addressed to the Taiwanese authorities on the other side.   ""One country, two systems: reunify China,"" says the slogan, referencing the political compromise that saw Hong Kong and Macau returned to the mainland's rule in the 1990s.

On Wednesday Donald Trump's huffy refusal to attend successor Joe Biden's inauguration created an unprecedented challenge.  Trump travelled to Florida three hours before Biden was sworn in and, as he was still president, he took with him the nuclear ""football,"" the bag containing the procedures and equipment for a launch.  He also would have had in his pocket the ""biscuit"" -- a card of authentication codes for embarking on a nuclear launch that only the president can use.  Biden, though, needed the launch codes and communications at his side from the moment he became president and commander in chief, at noon in Washington.  So for the first time in a transfer of presidential power, there was a second active ""football"" -- actually a hefty black leather briefcase always carried by the president's military aide -- for the occasion.  At noon, just as he took the oath of office, Biden had a military officer standing nearby with the duplicate nuclear briefcase, and he received his own biscuit.  Trump's meanwhile expired, like an outdated credit card.  While it was a new test of maintaining unbroken presidential control over conducting nuclear war, it wasn't actually too difficult.  There are always three footballs around: one with the president, another with the vice president in case he has to assume power, and third backup.  In the final days of Trump's administration, and especially after the January 6 attack on the Congress by supporters of Trump, some concern was expressed about him retaining the power to order a nuclear attack.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, expressed concern about the football and biscuit being in the hands of a possibly ""unstable"" Republican president.  Former defense secretary William Perry said Pelosi's question highlighted the risk of giving any president that singular power.  ""It's time to get rid of the nuclear football. It's no longer necessary, and its very existence is a danger to our national security,"" he wrote in Politico.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

""I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uighurs by the Chinese party-state,"" Pompeo said in a statement.  ""We will not remain silent. If the Chinese Communist Party is allowed to commit genocide and crimes against humanity against its own people, imagine what it will be emboldened to do to the free world, in the not-so-distant future,"" he said.  Pompeo's vociferous criticism of Beijing has been a hallmark of his tenure but he had earlier danced around directly alleging genocide, saying repeatedly that the treatment of Uighurs was reminiscent of Nazi Germany's policies.  Pompeo urged all international bodies including courts to take up cases over China's treatment of the Uighurs and voiced confidence that the United States would keep raising pressure.  Rights groups believe that at least one million Uighurs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims are incarcerated in camps in the western region of Xinjiang.  Witnesses and activists say that China is seeking to forcibly integrate the Uighurs into the majority Han culture by eradicating Islamic customs, including by forcing Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol, which are both forbidden by their faith.  China denies wrongdoing and contends that its camps are vocational training centers meant to reduce the allure of Islamic extremism in the wake of attacks.  Unlike many decisions by Pompeo seen as boxing in Joe Biden, the incoming president had called for more pressure on China on human rights with his campaign last year using the term genocide.  Antony Blinken, Biden's pick to succeed Pompeo, agreed with the genocide determination, saying in response to a question at his confirmation hearing, ""That would be my judgment as well.""  Blinken and other Biden nominees all promised firm action against China, although Pompeo's statement potentially allows the next administration to avoid the expected blowback by Beijing.    - Culmination of pressure -    Omer Kanat, executive director of the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, hoped that the genocide determination would lead to further steps such as a boycott of next year's Beijing Winter Olympics.  ""The implications are enormous. It's unthinkable to continue 'business as usual' with a state committing genocide and crimes against humanity,"" he said in a statement.  The Trump administration has already taken a number of steps to pressure China over its treatment of the Uighurs, including blocking all imports of cotton from Xinjiang -- one of the major global producers of yarn used in textile manufacturing.  Pompeo -- described this week by Beijing as a ""praying mantis"" -- has not been shy about criticizing China but made the determination after extended debate on the legal implications at home and abroad.  Previous administrations have been cautious about using the term. George W. Bush's administration described Sudan's scorched-earth campaign in Darfur as genocide, while Barack Obama's administration said likewise about the Islamic State extremist group's mass killings, rape and enslavement of Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities.  Lawmakers across the political spectrum have called on the United States to declare that China is carrying out genocide against the Uighurs, saying that evidence was increasingly clear.  In a study last year, German researcher Adrian Zenz found that China has forcibly sterilized large numbers of Uighur women and pressured them to abort pregnancies that exceed birth quotas. China denied the account, saying that Uighur women were breaking free from ""extremism"" by using contraception.  Pompeo in his statement called on China to ""abolish its system of internment, detention camps, house arrest and forced labor"" and ""cease coercive population control measures, including forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced birth control, and the removal of children from their families.""  He also urged China to ""end all torture and abuse"" in custody and allow Uighurs and other minorities to emigrate.  sct/jm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Retrieving the boxes -- cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- will likely help explain why the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged about 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) in less than a minute before slamming into the Java Sea.   Investigators have so far been unable to say why the 26-year-old plane crashed just four minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, but they do know the location of the black boxes.   The plane's captain, Afwan, a 54-year-old father of three, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, was a former air force pilot with decades of flying under his belt, according to local media.  Some of the 2,600 personnel working in the recovery effort involving dozens of boats and helicopters are hauling body parts, twisted piece of wreckage and passengers' clothing from shallow waters about 23 metres (75 feet) deep.  Underwater photos supplied by Indonesia's navy showed a sea floor littered with wreckage.   Body bags filled with human remains are being taken to a police hospital where investigators hope to identify victims by matching DNA from their remains to living relatives.  - Switched flight -    Rapin Akbar, who gave a blood sample to the hospital, had five relatives on board including an older sister, a nephew and his wife and their seven-month-old baby.   They were flying back to Pontianak, the city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island which had been flight SJ182's destination, about 90 minutes away.  ""(My nephew) had planned to go back to Pontianak on Sunday but changed his mind and decided to fly on Saturday instead,"" the shocked Akbar told AFP.   ""He called me to say the flight was delayed and sent me a picture of their baby. It was (their) first.""  All 62 passengers and crew aboard the half-full flight were Indonesian. The count included 10 children.    - Black box data -    Despite the name, black boxes are usually bright orange with reflective stripes, and all commercial planes are obliged to have them on board.   They're built to survive at vast depths and in extreme heat, and are fitted with a beacon which can emit a signal for one month.   The devices record information about the speed, altitude and direction of the plane as well as flight crew conversations.  Black box data help explain nearly 90 percent of all crashes, according to aviation experts.  The probe into Saturday's crash -- the latest in a string of disasters for Indonesia's aviation sector -- is likely to take months.  Aviation analysts said flight-tracking data showed the plane sharply deviated from its intended course before it went into a steep dive, with bad weather, pilot error and mechanical malfunction among the potential factors.  ""Something quite dramatic has happened after takeoff,"" said Stephen Wright, professor of aircraft systems at Finland's Tampere University.  ""The airspeed is far too low. The aircraft didn't accelerate up to the correct speeds for continuous flight.""    - Spotty safety record -    Sriwijaya Air, which flies to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said little about the plane, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.   The Indonesian carrier has not recorded a fatal crash since it started operations in 2003.   But the Southeast Asian nation's fast-growing aviation sector has long been plagued by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.   That accident -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the accidents.   The 737 model that went down Saturday was first produced decades ago and was not a MAX variant.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.   A year later more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/kma   BOEING    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

From Vladivostok in the Far East to Saint Petersburg on the Baltic Sea, thousands of police in riot gear were deployed to prevent a second weekend of mass demonstrations over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent.   Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning he blames on the Kremlin.  The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a Moscow detention centre and facing years of potential jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.  In moves not seen in years in Moscow, police locked down the centre of the capital on Sunday, with hundreds lining the streets, central Metro stations closed and the movements of pedestrians restricted.  Protesters who had hoped to gather outside the headquarters of the FSB security service were instead scattered to various parts of the city as organisers made last-minute changes in locations.  AFP journalists saw dozens of protesters detained and forced into police vans. It was unclear amid the chaos how many people were taking part.    - 'People are outraged' -    Independent monitor OVD-Info said more than 1,500 people had so far been detained across the country, including more than 300 in Moscow. It reported more than 4,000 detentions during last weekend's protests.  Hundreds were marching through the city centre chanting ""Freedom!"" and ""Putin is a thief!"" as they headed towards the Matrosskaya Tishina prison where Navalny was being held.   Police followed the protesters, breaking up the crowds and playing pre-recorded messages on loudspeakers warning that the gathering was illegal because of coronavirus restrictions.   ""The people in power don't want to listen to anything or to anybody,"" 34-year-old vet Darya told AFP at the Moscow rally.  In the second city of Saint Petersburg police closed off the main thoroughfare Nevsky Prospekt, closed Metro stations and police cars were parked all across the centre, an AFP journalist reported.   ""The whole centre is cordoned off,"" said Natalya Grigoryeva, who came to the Saint Petersburg rally with her daughter. ""And who is this all against, against their own people?""  Earlier protesters had rallied in cities including the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where several dozen gathered in a central square despite police closing it off ahead of the rally.  Several thousand were also reported to have protested in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk despite temperatures dropping to -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).  Local politician and Navalny ally Helga Pirogova told AFP that Sunday's protest in Novosibirsk was potentially bigger than the week before.  ""People are still outraged by what is happening,"" the 32-year-old said.  The US embassy in Moscow condemned the arrests and blocking of the city centre in Moscow, saying in a tweet: ""Russia must respect international human rights commitments.""   Russian authorities issued several warnings against participating in the unauthorised rallies and threatened criminal charges against protesters.  Navalny is due in court in several cases next week, including on February 2 on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.   His wife Yulia posted a picture of her family on Instagram on Sunday, urging supporters to make their voices heard.  ""If we remain silent, then tomorrow they will come for any one of us,"" she wrote.     - Allies in custody -    This week several Navalny associates, including lawyer Lyubov Sobol and his brother Oleg, were placed under house arrest until late March pending charges for violating coronavirus restrictions by calling people to join protests.  Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh was detained late Saturday also over violating virus measures, the same day she was due to walk free after a nine-day jail term for violating protest laws.   In a continued effort to clamp down on online platforms used to coordinate the rallies, Russia's media watchdog on Sunday ordered social networks to block posts with ""false"" information about the protests, including those ""over-estimating"" numbers of participants.  Days after Navalny was taken into custody, his team released a video report alleging Putin had been gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast, garnering over 100 million views on YouTube.  The Kremlin has denied that the Russian president owns the opulent complex, which according to Navalny features an underground ice hockey arena, a private casino and vineyards.  Billionaire businessman Arkady Rotenberg -- Putin's former judo partner who is under Western sanctions -- said Saturday he was the owner of the property and that he was building a hotel there.   tbm-acl/mm/wdb   GOOGLE",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

With hundreds of hydropower plants spread across the Alps, Switzerland produces more than enough power in the summer months. However, the landlocked nation is forced to turn to imports when the cold sets in.  That is not usually a problem, but this year, with the war in Ukraine, and Russia slashing gas deliveries to much of Europe, the threat of severe power shortages is looming.  While other European countries are also feeling the sting, the situation is particularly precarious in Switzerland, which lacks its own gas storage installations.  It usually depends on imports from the surrounding European Union, and especially of gas-derived electricity from Germany, but with the bloc wary about its own power supply, non-member Switzerland finds itself at the back of the queue.  Compounding the problem, neighbouring France has been forced to halt production at half of its reactors, mainly due to corrosion problems, Stephane Genoud, an energy management professor at the Swiss HES-SO university, told AFP.  Bern has been working to build up Switzerland's energy production and storage systems, but even the grand opening next month of a new, powerful pumped-storage hydroelectric plant is unlikely to help avoid problems this winter.    - 'Giant battery' -    The Nant de Drance plant is located in a cavern 600 metres (2,000 feet) below ground at an altitude of 1,700 metres (5,600 feet), just a few kilometres from Mont Blanc, Western Europe's highest peak.  Unlike typical hydropower systems, which create power by releasing water from a reservoir through turbines, pumped-storage systems do not run out of juice as the reservoir empties out.  Instead, the Nant de Drance plant, situated between two reservoirs, functions ""like a giant battery,"" said Robert Gleitz, of Swiss energy company Alpiq, a key shareholder in the facility.  It produces energy in the traditional way during demand peaks by sending water from the higher Vieux-Emosson reservoir plunging down into the Emosson reservoir below.  But when solar and wind power production is high and there is less demand for electricity from the plant, the water from Emosson is pumped back to the higher reservoir, storing the excess electricity generated.  ""When there is too much electricity in the grid, we store the water in the upper reservoir,"" Gleitz told AFP during a tour of the facility.  It can thus boost production during times of higher demand, as in winter, reducing the need to import power.    - 'High risk' -    But Gleitz warned that while the new plant will help Switzerland better withstand brief consumption peaks, it would help little in the face of long-term shortages.  The plant ""usefully supplements a renewable electricity production that remains too low,"" said Nicolas Wuthrich of nature preservation group Pro Natura.  That organisation and others have long lamented that Switzerland, which has vowed to decommission its ageing nuclear reactors, is dragging its feet on transitioning to renewables.  The country counted only 37 wind turbines in 2020, while experts say some 750 would be needed to reach the government's 2050 renewable energy target.    - Blackouts -    The Swiss organisation in charge of ensuring energy access in times of crisis warned in late 2021 that there was a ""high risk of a power shortage emerging.""  Geopolitical events since then have only increased the likelihood.  Bern has cautioned against exaggerating the risks, but has also acknowledged it is preparing for power shortages, with the head of the federal electricity commission, Werner Luginbuhl, warning of repeated, hours-long power cuts.  Retailers across the country are reporting a consumer rush on solar panels and generators.  There is still a chance to avoid outages, said Genoud.  ""If the French manage to restart their reactors and if Putin doesn't make things too difficult and if it doesn't get too cold, we could avoid shortages or a blackout.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

""This will be a good opportunity to discuss with my Russian counterpart all relevant issues, to pass clear messages on the current situation,"" Borrell said after a meeting of the bloc's 27 foreign ministers.   The ministers debated slapping sanctions on the Kremlin after the detention of Navalny and thousands of protesters across Russia, but decided this was ""premature"", one diplomat said.   ""For sure the council is ready to react according to the circumstances and to take appropriate actions if the circumstances require,"" Borrell said.   ""But today there has not been any kind of proposal and as a consequence any kind of decision about it.""  European diplomats had earlier said Brussels was expected to hold off on sanctions until Navalny goes to court on February 2, to see whether the Kremlin puts him behind bars for an extended term.   ""Sanctions are a possible tool, but it is necessary to wait to see what happens in Moscow,"" another diplomat said.   Navalny is facing a possible three-and-a-half-year jail sentence, for breaching the conditions of an earlier suspended term while he was recovering in Germany from a near-fatal poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent.   The arrest of the anti-corruption campaigner on his return to Russia unleashed a wave of protests Saturday that saw baton-wielding riot police detain more than 3,500 people.  The EU has called for the immediate release of Navalny and of peaceful protesters detained during the nationwide rallies.   Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said the bloc ""needs to send a very clear and decisive message that this is not acceptable"".    - No Turkey sanctions either -    Borrell has insisted on sticking to his planned trip, which would be the first to Moscow by an EU foreign policy chief since 2017, despite opposition from several countries.     Diplomats have argued that the Kremlin could use the visit to show the EU is continuing with ""business as normal"" despite the clampdown on the opposition.   But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas insisted Borrell would be ""very clear"" about the EU's grievances when he meets Russia's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov.

If the government's plans are successful, maybe one day you will no longer see it for real"".    - 'No freedom' -    Radio stations also suspended service, with Radio ZET informing its listeners that the tax would mean ""liquidation for some media businesses"".  ""There is no free country without independent media. There is no freedom without freedom of choice,"" the radio station said on its website.  Expected to take effect later this year, the new tax imposes a levy on advertising revenues of television and radio broadcasters, print outlets and internet media companies.  State-owned broadcaster TVP, which has become a mouthpiece for Poland's populist right-wing government, did not join in the protest.  Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said earlier that the move is part of Europe-wide efforts to tax global tech giants like Google or Facebook but independent media say they would be hit too.  Morawiecki has called it a ""solidarity fee"" that will ""create better conditions for the development of free media"" and help fund healthcare and the culture sector.    - 'Cornerstone of democracy' -    Government spokesman Piotr Muller said the tax would only target large media companies and the rate would be between 2 and 15 percent of advertising revenue, depending on the company's overall revenues and the type of advertising.  Muller said the tax would also affect public television and dismissed the protest saying that ""everyone would like not to pay taxes"".  The finance ministry struck a more conciliatory tone, telling the Polish news agency PAP that it was open to holding talks with media outlets to come up with a solution acceptable to all.  Since coming to power in 2015, the Law and Justice (PiS) party has taken control of public media and has underlined the need to ""re-polonise"" the media landscape.  In December, state-owned oil giant PKN Orlen bought the newspaper group Polska Press from the German company Verlagsgruppe Passau.  Poland's anti-monopoly office also turned down a request for a merger between Agora media group and Radio ZET -- a refusal seen as political by commentators.  The tax comes as many media companies struggle with shrinking advertising income and a loss of revenue because of the pandemic.  ""There has never been a protest on this scale in the history of Polish media,"" said Boguslaw Chrabota, editor of the Rzeczpospolita daily.  Chrabota wrote that the draft regulation was ""repressive for free media"", warning of ""a crisis that is slowly threatening our existence"".  There was international criticism too.  The US charge d'affaires in Warsaw Bix Aliu tweeted: ""A free media is the cornerstone of democracy. The United States will always defend the independence of the media"".  Global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accused the PiS of using the ""#COVID19 context as an opportunity to stifle the media.""  In its 2020 world report on press freedom, RSF found that ""partisan discourse and hate speech are still the rule within (Poland's) state-owned media, which have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces.""  dt/amj/pvh   DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS    FACEBOOK    GOOGLE    PKN ORLEN",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105427021']

Efforts in Australia to make Google and Facebook pay for news has garnered worldwide attention, creating what some call a defining moment for the web and for journalism, and even a litmus test for democracy.  But beyond the high-sounding rhetoric lies a more base struggle, with the barons of traditional media fighting back against their digital heirs.  Sydney tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes went as far as calling the Australian push to force payments for content a ""shakedown"".  The landmark legislation may carry the seal of government, but media and political insiders see the fingerprints of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp all over it.  ""This has been a passionate cause for our company for well over a decade,"" said News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson, hailing his boss' ""fervent, unstinting support"" for the cause.  ""For many years, we were accused of tilting at tech windmills, but what was a solitary campaign, a quixotic quest, has become a movement, and both journalism and society will be enhanced.""  For decades, the Melbourne-born billionaire behind Fox News, The Sun and Sky News Australia has bestraddled politics in the United States, Britain and Down Under.  Today, he controls roughly two-thirds of daily newspaper circulation in Australia's major cities, with complete monopolies in Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Darwin.  That has prompted critics to paint the 89-year-old in almost cartoonish terms -- as an all-powerful political puppetmaster.  While he still wields political power, the rise of Facebook and Google has seriously challenged Murdoch's preeminence -- gouging ad revenues that kept many of his publications in the black.    - 'Frightened of Murdoch' -    At the turn of the millennium, newspapers had 96 percent of Australia's classified revenues. Now, that is down to around 12 percent.  For every $100 spent by Australian advertisers today, $49 goes to Google and $24 to Facebook, according to the country's competition watchdog, which proposed the law in direct response to this duopoly.  ""Let's not kid around, this was very deliberately designed to put money in the pockets of a very few specific companies -- News Corp and others,"" Lucie Krahulcova of advocacy group Digital Rights Watch told AFP.  An initial draft of the law even cut out public broadcaster ABC -- which Murdoch's outlets and Australia's conservative government have long attacked -- from receiving Google and Facebook payments.   Former prime minister Kevin Rudd, an outspoken Murdoch critic, told lawmakers in Canberra on Friday that the proposed laws solved the digital dominance problem ""by enhancing the power of the existing monopoly -- that's Murdoch"".  ""Everyone is frightened of Murdoch,"" he maintained.  Everyone, it seems, except Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who made a worldwide splash last week by refusing demands to pay Murdoch's News Corp and other Australian media.  Rather than follow Google and reach agreements to pay for content, Zuckerberg went nuclear, removing news from Australia on the platform and sparking a global backlash.    - Enormous political power -    The two men were born more than three decades part and come from staggeringly different eras, but both wield enormous political power.  Where Murdoch could hobble governments or torpedo campaigns with a rapier front-page splash, Zuckerberg's platform can change the tenor of a US election campaign.  Like Murdoch, Zuckerberg has come under fierce scrutiny for his influence over society.  It is also not the first time they have tussled.  Murdoch's bid for social media dominance failed spectacularly when MySpace was left in the dust of Zuckerberg's rapidly growing Facebook.  According to reports by tech magazine and website Wired, the pair had a testy exchange in Sun Valley, Idaho in 2016, with Zuckerberg allegedly warned to offer publishers a better deal or expect New Corp to lobby regulators around the world.  Those lobbying efforts are now bearing fruit in Australia, with Google agreeing to pay the company for news in a three-year deal.  The amounts were not disclosed, but similar Google deals with other Australian media groups were said to be worth around US$23 million a year.  Supporters have cheered that as a victory for journalism -- a struggling industry long in decline -- although questions remain about whether the money will be ploughed back into reporting.  With legislation in the works in Canada, Europe and perhaps even the United States, Murdoch's ""quixotic quest"" against the tech giants is unlikely to stop in Australia.  arb/qan   FACEBOOK    GOOGLE    NEWS CORPORATION",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612975']

The Israeli army said the strikes were part of an operation ""against targets in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad"" group.  ""The IDF (Israeli military) is currently striking in the Gaza Strip. A special situation has been declared on the Israeli home front.""  Islamic Jihad said Israel had ""started a war against our people"".  ""We collectively must defend ourselves and our people.

Islamic Jihad said it was mourning ""the great jihadist commander Tayseer al-Jabari 'Abu Mahmud', who was killed in a Zionist assassination in Gaza City"", a statement said.  The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, which has a strong presence in Gaza.  Ahead of launching air strikes, Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz told Gaza militants: ""Your time is up.  ""To our enemies, and specifically to the leadership of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, I would like to emphasise: your time is up. The threat will be removed one way or another,"" he said.  On Friday afternoon, the Israeli military banned large gatherings in communities within 80 kilometres (50 miles) of the Gaza frontier, until Saturday evening.   The measures follow four days of road closures and other restrictions on movement in the border area.  Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.  Gaza's only power station is at risk of imminent outage due to a lack of fuel supplies through Israel, its manager warned on Thursday.

But one thing was missing: the big crowd he loves.   With less than four hours left before Joe Biden took over, Trump had to rush to make his exit from the White House to Florida before losing the trappings of the presidency.  So after an 8:18 am departure on Marine One from the South Lawn, he landed at Joint Base Andrews alongside the gleaming presidential Boeing 747 -- Air Force One.  An Air Force band played ""Hail to the Chief."" And black army field guns fired off a 21 gun salute.  But for all the military precision the one thing Trump loves most of all -- enormous, adoring crowds chanting ""We love Trump!"" -- was missing.  About 500 fans turned out in the icy wind, standing in a fenced off area in front of the stage. Half of the section remained glaringly empty.  ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" Trump said in a short address that sounded a lot like his campaign speeches, except that it was now a goodbye.  ""It was my greatest honor and privilege to be your president,"" he said. ""Have a good life.""    - Defeated president -    Ignore the small crowd and the occasion might have resembled something honoring a leader at the height of his powers, not a defeated one-term president with the unique distinction of facing an impeachment trial after he's gone.  But looking closer, not everything quite clicked with the message Trump -- who makes a point of mocking ""losers"" -- wanted to send.  The awkwardness of gathering at a windswept base in the Washington suburbs at breakfast time was the first clue.  Trump had no choice, not if he wanted all the presidential toys: the clock was running down to the moment when he'd have to give them back.  So he needed literally every minute to make it in Air Force One to Florida and still have use of the presidential motorcade to reach his golf club residence in Palm Beach before the clock struck 12.    - Cold walk -    In a bid to boost crowd numbers, the White House cast its net wide when it sent out invitations.  Individual invitees reportedly were told they could bring up to five friends.  One invite even made it to Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired from the post of communications director after working just 11 days at the start of Trump's term, then turned into a caustic television critic of the president.  Scaramucci said the White House didn't seem to care who came.  ""Trust me, that had to be a mass email if one of them got sent to me,"" he told the Inside Edition TV show.  A lot of big names, far bigger than the colorful Scaramucci, also got invites and also said no.  They were busy.  Vice President Mike Pence, the picture of loyalty to Trump for the last four years, issued his public schedule for Wednesday early the day before.  The one item on the otherwise blank page spoke volumes:  ""11:00AM. THE VICE PRESIDENT and THE SECOND LADY attend the 59th Inaugural Ceremonies.""  Pence wasn't attending his old boss' departure because he was going to be at the new president's arrival.  The widely respected former Trump chief of staff and a retired Marine general, John Kelly, was invited -- even if he had also turned into a very public, biting critic.  Kelly told CNN he had other engagements.  Two big beasts of Congress -- loyal Trump supporters senior Senate Republican Mitch McConnell and his House of Representatives counterpart Kevin McCarthy -- had yet another excuse: they'd accepted an invitation to attend church with Biden that morning.  A red carpet led across the military runway to the steps of Air Force One. For soon to be ex-president Trump, it was a long, cold walk.  sms/dw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The 36-year-old, who was ordained a priest in June, was one of 11 people who were injured during Wednesday's blast that officials said was caused by a gas leak.  He died in hospital in the early hours of Thursday, the Madrid archdiocese said in a statement.  The explosion in the central La Latina district destroyed almost all of the multi-storey building which belongs to the nearby church of the Virgin de la Paloma.   It also killed two men, aged 85 and 47, who were walking down the street at the time, local officials said.  The younger man was a Bulgarian national, the country's foreign ministry confirmed Wednesday.  The other victim was a 35-year-old electrician and father-of-four who had been repairing a boiler on the fifth floor of the building.  Reportedly employed by Madrid metro's maintenance department, he lived on the street and was active in the local church.  A man who was initially reported missing was later confirmed to be the repairman, government representative Jose Manuel Franco told radio Cadena Ser.  Neighbours reported a strong smell of gas in the minutes before the blast, he said.  - 'Thought it was a bomb' -    ""I was just leaving a nearby clinic when I heard a very big explosion, it was so big I thought it was a bomb,"" Valentin Moreno, a 48-year-old salesman, told AFP.   ""There were people running and a lot of smoke and when I got there, I saw the building's facade had been completely destroyed.""  Pope Francis said he was praying for the victims and their families in these ""difficult moments"" in a telegram sent to the Archbishop of Madrid, Cardinal Carlos Osoro, the city's archdiocese said.  Despite the force of the explosion, no one was hurt in the elderly care home next door, nor in an adjacent school where tonnes of debris fell into the playground while children were in class.  Wednesday was the first day that schools reopened after a nine-day closure due to the heaviest snowfall in Madrid in 50 years.  ""This could have been a massive tragedy,"" said Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida.  The building, which was located behind the church, was used as a parish centre and contained several apartments used by local priests as well as office space used by the Caritas charity.   At least 15 cars were either destroyed or damaged by the blast.

The study released Monday by the security firm Emsisoft said ransomware attacks -- which encrypt and disable computer systems while demanding a ransom -- affected 113 federal, state and municipal governments, 560 health facilities and 1,681 schools, colleges and universities last year.  ""The attacks caused significant, and sometimes life-threatening, disruption: ambulances carrying emergency patients had to be redirected, cancer treatments were delayed, lab test results were inaccessible, hospital employees were furloughed and 911 (emergency) services were interrupted,"" the report said.  The security firm said it was unable to estimate the losses from the attacks due to a lack of data but that it was ""safe to assume that the total cost runs to multiple billions.""  The numbers of attacks were little changed from 2019 but there were ""more successful attacks on the healthcare sector,"" including incidents affecting groups with multiple hospitals, according to Emsisoft spokesman Brett Callow.

The comments reflect an unusual area of common ground with outgoing president Donald Trump, who during his term unleashed on China an aggressive and costly trade war that imposed billions of dollars in punitive tariffs.  But Janet Yellen drew a line under key areas of difference, especially the Biden administration's commitment to work with US allies rather than going it alone, and to promote investments to make American firms and workers more competitive against Beijing.  Responding to questions from the Senate Finance Committee at her Tuesday confirmation hearing, Yellen called China ""our most important strategic competitor.""  She accused Beijing of ""undercutting American companies"" with a series of policies, including illegal subsidies, dumping of products, theft of intellectual property and barriers to US goods.  ""We need to take on China's abusive unfair and illegal practices,"" she said, adding ""we're prepared to use the full array of tools"" to address those issues.  Speaking the day before Biden is due to take office, she also vowed to be watchful of the national security concerns over China's theft of ""trade secrets"" and ""illegal efforts to acquire critical technology.""    - Investing in America -    However, unlike Trump, who pulled back from multilateral organizations and attacked the trade policies of US partners and adversaries alike, Yellen stressed that it will be important ""to work with our allies"" to combat the challenge posed by China.  Democrats have for years complained bitterly about the exodus of jobs and manufacturing to the Asian country. Trump, a Republican, doubled down on those complaints and won many workers' support.  Biden, a Democrat, similarly pledged to defend American workers and manufacturing, and Yellen said that would help fend off Beijing's economic challenge.  The United States needs to ""make investments that allow us to compete with China... by investing in our infrastructure, investing in our people and creating a more competitive economy,"" she said.  Biden, whose campaign slogan was ""Build Bank Better,"" is expected to soon propose a stimulus plan that includes massive infrastructure investments.    - Currency manipulation -    Trump, like other administrations before him, also accused China of keeping its currency artificially low as a way to make its products cheaper and gain a trade advantage, and Yellen repeated the opposition to that practice.  The US dollar ""should be determined by markets,"" Yellen said, and ""if confirmed, I will work to implement the President-elect's promise to oppose any and all attempts by foreign countries to artificially manipulate currency values to gain an unfair advantage in trade.""  She also told senators that global digital tax negotiations under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are important for Washington to levy taxes on corporations that have moved their headquarters overseas.

Thousands of protesters defied government warnings to rally from Vladivostok to Saint Petersburg in a second weekend of mass demonstrations over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic.  Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning he blames on the Kremlin.  The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a Moscow detention centre and faces years of potential jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.  In moves not seen in years in Moscow, authorities locked down the centre of the capital Sunday, with hundreds of police lining the streets, central Metro stations closed and the movements of pedestrians restricted.  Protesters who had hoped to gather outside the headquarters of the FSB security service were instead scattered to various parts of the city as organisers made last-minute changes in locations.  AFP journalists saw dozens of protesters detained and taken into police vans.   Several thousand were seen marching throughout the city centre, but it was unclear amid the chaos how many people took part in the demonstration.   Independent monitor OVD-Info said at least 4,027 people had been detained across the country, after reporting more than 4,000 detentions during similar protests last Saturday.  It said 1,167 were detained in Moscow and 862 in Saint Petersburg, as well as at least 82 journalists across the country.     - Golden toilet brushes -    US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Twitter condemned ""the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists by Russian authorities for a second week straight.""  The Russian foreign ministry hit back, accusing the United States of ""gross interference"" in its affairs and of using ""online platforms controlled by Washington"" to promote the protests.  Protesters chanted ""Freedom!"" and ""Putin is a thief!"" as they marched through Moscow in bitter cold and snow.   ""If this is happening now to a person who is famous in Russia and the world, it could happen to anyone in the future,"" protester Philip said at the Moscow rally.  Protesters eventually gathered outside the Matrosskaya Tishina prison where Navalny was being held and several dozen were detained outside the complex.  Many protesters carried gold-painted toilet brushes in reference to a video released by Navalny's team alleging that Putin had been gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast, which among other luxurious goods featured toilet brushes costing 700 euros apiece.  Several thousand people demonstrated in the second city of Saint Petersburg, despite police closing off the main thoroughfare Nevsky Prospekt and shutting Metro stations, an AFP journalist reported.   Police were seen roughly detaining several protesters, including one young man who was left with a bloodied head.  Local media reported that police used tear gas and tasers in the city, while one policeman reportedly threatened protesters with his service weapon.   ""The whole centre is cordoned off,"" said Natalya Grigoryeva, who came to the Saint Petersburg rally with her daughter. ""And who is this all against, against their own people?""  Earlier protesters had rallied in cities including the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where dozens escaped the police on the frozen waters of the Amur Bay and danced in a circle.  Several thousand were also reported to have protested in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk despite temperatures dropping to -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).    - Navalny's wife detained -    Russian authorities issued several warnings against participating in the unauthorised rallies and threatened criminal charges against protesters.  The head of Russia's Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, called Sunday's events a ""provocation"" and said they have ""nothing to do with protecting rights,"" news agency TASS reported.  Navalny is due in court several times next week, including on Tuesday on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.   His team has called for supporters to gather outside the courtroom.  Navalny's wife Yulia posted a picture of her family on Instagram on Sunday, urging supporters to make their voices heard.  ""If we remain silent, then tomorrow they will come for any one of us,"" she wrote.  Navalny's team said Yulia was detained by police shortly after she announced her arrival at Sunday's rally on social media.  This week several Navalny associates were placed under house arrest pending charges for violating coronavirus restrictions by calling people to join protests.  tbm-acl/mm/lc",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

Nureddin Nebati's Twitter comments represent Ankara's first official response to a letter the US Treasury sent to Turkish businesses on Monday.  US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo warned Turkish banks and companies they would face secondary sanctions if they cooperated with Russians sanctioned in response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.  The value of Turkey's trade with Russia shot up by nearly 50 percent between May and July.  Nebati said the letter should not ""cause concern in our business circles. Turkey is one of the most important political and economic power centres in the world"".  NATO member Turkey -- on good terms with both Moscow and Kyiv -- has tried to stay neutral in the conflict and refused to join the international sanctions.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to step up economic cooperation at a summit in the Black Sea resort of Sochi earlier this month.  US officials worry that sanctioned Russians are setting up Turkish entities to trade with the outside world.  They are also concerned that European companies are doing the same to circumnavigate EU sanctions imposed on Russian trade.  Nebati said Turkey was ""determined to develop our commercial relations with our neighbours in various sectors -- especially tourism -- within a framework that is not subject to sanctions.""  A part of the US concern stems from Turkey's decision to transition to paying rubles for the natural gas it imports from the Kremlin-tied giant Gazprom.  Washington is also worried that Russia may be using Turkey to acquire technology whose export has been banned by Washington and the EU.  Data reviewed by The Wall Street Journal showed Russians opening more than 500 companies in Turkey since the start of the year -- more than double the number started last year.  Erdogan has argued that Turkey must remain ""neutral"" in the conflict because its industries rely heavily on Russian energy imports.  zak/kjm   GAZPROM",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The United States saw 900,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, a huge number that remains well above the single worst week of the 2008-2010 global financial crisis, during which Biden served as vice president under Barack Obama.  Economists had been expecting a significant reduction in seasonally adjusted claims in the week ended January 16, but instead they fell just 26,000 from the prior week's downwardly revised total, underscoring the damage done by the pandemic's renewed onslaught in the country.  The government also reported 423,734 new filings made under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for self-employed people not normally eligible for benefits.  That was nearly twice the week prior, after that program lapsed briefly amid a standoff in Washington over extending it and other aid.  All told, nearly 16 million people were receiving some form of assistance from the government as of January 2 -- a figure that's expected to rise.  ""Layoffs are ongoing at an elevated pace, reflecting the impact of containment measures,"" Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said in an analysis.  ""Conditions are unlikely to improve until infections can be curbed, and the economy can reopen more completely.""    - Turning it around -    Citing the report, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese called on Congress to quickly enact Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan.  ""We must act now to get this virus under control, stabilize the economy and reduce the long-term scarring that will only worsen if bold action isn't taken,"" he said in a statement.  New jobless filings skyrocketed after states and cities restricted business across the country when Covid-19 broke out in March.   Though they've come down from the millions initially reported each week as businesses shed employees en masse, they have remained at very high levels ever since.  The unemployment rate has seen a similar trajectory, shooting up to 14.7 percent in April but declining in subsequent months to its current 6.7 percent.  Biden's spending proposal is aimed at both improving the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines that are seen as the economy's best hope for a sustained recovery, and aiding small businesses and the unemployed.  But even with the plan, Lydia Boussour of Oxford Economics warned the job market is in for rough times to come.  ""Fiscal stimulus prospects, along with broader vaccine diffusion, are pointing to a brightening labor market outlook but with the pandemic still raging, claims are poised to remain elevated in the near-term,"" she said.    - Chopping it down -    With his Democrats only narrowly controlling both houses of Congress, it's unclear what degree of support Biden's package will get from Republicans.  Michael Feroli of JP Morgan predicted Congress could pare the president's plan down to the $900 billion range, matching a separate measure approved last month.   Even the smaller amount would boost GDP growth this year to 5.3 percent and in 2022 to 2.6 percent, he said, a ""remarkable expected turnaround"" aided also by negligible inflation and the Federal Reserve's maintenance of low borrowing rates.  Sectors of the economy have nonetheless prospered during the pandemic, with the Commerce Department reporting on Thursday homebuilding projects jumped 5.8 percent in December from the month prior.  That was 12 percent higher than December 2019, despite the toll of Covid-19.  cs/dw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

On the eve of Biden's inauguration, Blinken was set to say at his confirmation hearing that the United States will seek to remain the pre-eminent global power but renew cooperation on common challenges such as Covid-19 and climate change.  ""America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the greater good,"" Blinken, a mild-mannered longtime aide to Biden, was to tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to his prepared remarks.   ""We can outcompete China -- and remind the world that a government of the people, by the people, can deliver for its people,"" Blinken said, paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln's paean to democracy two weeks after a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol in hopes of overturning Biden's victory.  The stepson of a Holocaust survivor who found refuge in the US, Blinken, 58, is known for his passion on humanitarian causes.  He is expected to win Senate confirmation although Republicans have vowed to press him hard on his consulting work since leaving Barack Obama's administration four years ago.  In a sharp shift in tone from Trump's secretary of state Mike Pompeo -- who spoke of ""swagger,"" ""American exceptionalism"" and global conflict with China -- Blinken said he would show ""humility.""  ""Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone -- even one as powerful as the US,"" Blinken said.   ""We can revitalize our core alliances -- force multipliers of our influence around the world. Together, we are far better positioned to counter threats posed by Russia, Iran, and North Korea and to stand up for democracy and human rights.""    - Quick reversals from Trump -    Biden has promised to move swiftly after his inauguration at noon (1700 GMT) Wednesday to reverse some of Trump's most divisive policies.  Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris climate accord, reverse the US exit from the World Health Organization and end immigration agents' draconian separations of Latin American children from their families.  A Pew Research Center survey found that 79 percent of Germans, 72 percent of French and 65 percent of the British were confident in Biden's decision making.  It was a sharp reversal from the dismal marks for Trump, who shattered protocol by publicly assailing leaders of allies.  Biden is expected to seek a return to the Iran nuclear accord negotiated under Obama, believing that Trump's exit and imposition of sanctions backfired badly with Tehran escalating its contested program.  Biden also faces an immediate deadline with the February 5 expiration of the New START treaty on nuclear reduction, the last remaining arms pact with Russia.  Fellow Democrats have urged Biden to temporarily extend the treaty, an option supported by Moscow, after the Trump administration unsuccessfully sought to expand New START by bringing in China.  In its final days, the Trump administration has taken a slew of major decisions seen as attempting to box in the next team.  But in one that could be welcomed by Biden, Pompeo on Tuesday formally determined that China was carrying out genocide against the Uighurs and other mostly Muslim peoples -- meaning Blinken can stand by the decision without the same fallout from Beijing as if he issued the statement himself.    - US permanently scarred? -    With the world's eyes on the Capitol steps, new presidents have seized on inaugural addresses to make soaring statements of US international purpose, from John F. Kennedy's Cold War warning of a ""long twilight struggle"" to Obama's offer to adversaries ""to extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.""  Biden's inauguration will take place in a far darker atmosphere with virtually no crowd -- due both to the pandemic that has claimed two million lives worldwide and ultra-tight security after the pro-Trump mob's January 6 attack on the very building where Biden will take the oath.  ""America's image is irreversibly harmed. The most Biden can do is hope to patch up a few potholes and hope it will be a bit less of a bumpy ride,"" said Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat who heads the Global Situation Room consulting firm.  Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the political violence ""should put an end to the notion of American exceptionalism.""  ""A post-American world, one no longer defined by US primacy, is coming sooner than generally expected -- less because of the inevitable rise of others than because of what the United States has done to itself,"" Haass wrote in Foreign Affairs.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Myanmar's military has clamped down on press freedoms since its coup last year, arresting reporters and photographers as well as revoking broadcasting licences as the country plunged into chaos.  Toru Kubota, who was held while covering a protest in Yangon last week, ""has been charged under section 505 (a) and under immigration law 13-1"", the junta said in a statement.  505 (a) -- a law that criminalises encouraging dissent against the military and carries a maximum three-year jail term -- has been widely used in the crackdown on dissent.  Breaching immigration law 13-1 carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.  Filmmaker Kubota, 26, was detained near an anti-government rally in Yangon along with two Myanmar citizens.  After the charges were filed, he was transferred from police custody to Yangon's Insein prison, a security source told AFP, requesting anonymity.  ""He's in good health and embassy officials have visited him already at the police station where he has been detained.""  According to a profile on FilmFreeway, Kubota has previously made documentaries on Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority and ""refugees and ethnic issues in Myanmar"".  Kubota had arrived in Myanmar on July 14 and was filming a ""documentary featuring a Myanmar person"", his friend Yoshitaka Nitta told a press conference in Tokyo on Wednesday.   He is the fifth foreign journalist to be detained in Myanmar, after US citizens Nathan Maung and Danny Fenster, Robert Bociaga of Poland and Yuki Kitazumi of Japan -- all of whom were later freed and deported.  Fenster, who was held in May last year as he attempted to leave the country, faced a closed-door trial inside Insein on charges of unlawful association, incitement against the military and breaching visa rules.  He was sentenced to 11 years in prison before being pardoned and deported.    - 'War on journalists' -    ""The regime has declared war on journalists, and 505a is its preferred charge,"" said Richard Horsey of the International Crisis Group.  ""This charge against a Japanese journalist shows the regime is determined to continue stifling objective reporting, whether by local or foreign journalists.""  Japan's foreign ministry said in a statement that its embassy in Myanmar was ""appealing to the Myanmar authorities for the early release of the Japanese man, and will continue to make efforts to gather information and request his early release"".  Tokyo is a top donor to Myanmar and has long-standing relations with the country's military.  The already isolated junta stoked further international outrage last week when it announced the execution of four prisoners, in the country's first use of capital punishment in decades.   ""The situation in Burma has gone from bad to worse,"" United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, using the country's former name, after talks with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.  Blinken met Borrell on the sidelines of a meeting of Southeast Asian foreign ministers in Cambodia, from which Myanmar's top diplomat has been excluded over the junta's failure to open talks with its political opponents.  More than 2,100 people have been killed in the crackdown on dissent in Myanmar and almost 15,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group.  As of March this year, 48 journalists remain in custody across the country, according to the monitoring group Reporting ASEAN.  Only China jailed more reporters than Myanmar last year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.  bur-rma/dva   KUBOTA",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113435201']

Health authorities in the enclave controlled by Hamas Islamists said 10 people have been killed by Israel's bombardment, including a five-year-old girl, with 75 others injured. Israel's army estimated that its operation has killed 15 militants.   Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said the Jewish state was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive counter-terror operation against an immediate threat"" posed by the Islamic Jihad group, following days of tensions along the Gaza border.  Israel and Islamic Jihad have both confirmed the killing of a top commander with the militant group, Taysir al-Jabari, in a Friday strike.   Islamic Jihad said the initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"", before it unleashed a flurry of more than 100 rockets towards Israel.  The rocket fire and Israeli strikes continued overnight, risking a repeat of an 11-day conflict in May 2021 that devastated Gaza and forced countless Israelis to rush to bomb shelters.   ""Israel isn't interested in a wider conflict in Gaza, but will not shy away from one either,"" Lapid said in a nationally televised address.  Air raid sirens sounded overnight across several spots in southern and central Israel, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.   Officials in border areas urged people to stay close to shelters, which were also being opened in the commercial capital of Tel Aviv.  The army had initially confirmed at least 70 rocket launches from Gaza, saying 11 had fallen inside the strip, with dozens intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system, and that others had landed in open areas.   Egypt, a historic broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, was seeking to mediate and may host an Islamic Jihad delegation later Saturday, Egyptian officials told AFP in Gaza.    - Escalation, mediation -    Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May. Islamic Jihad is a separate group, aligned with Hamas, but that also acts independently.  A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor.  The sides exchanged fire for several days without Hamas joining the fray.   Hamas's moves amid the current violence could prove crucial in determining its severity, with the group facing pressure from some to maintain calm in order to improve economic conditions in the territory.   Gaza City resident Abdullah al-Arayshi said the situation was ""very tense"". ""The country is ravaged. We've had enough of wars. Our generation has lost its future,"" he told AFP.  Hamas said Israel has ""committed a new crime for which it must pay the price"".  Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.     - Five-year-old girl -    Flames poured out of a building in Gaza City following the first round of strikes, while wounded Palestinians were evacuated by medics.  Gaza's health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among nine people killed.   Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.   UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was ""deeply concerned"", warning that the escalation was ""very dangerous"".    - 'Pay the price' -    The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Islamic Jihad did not launch rocket attacks in response to the arrest, but Israel has insisted through the week that the group was committed to seeking revenge.   Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.  Gaza's only power station is at risk of imminent outage due to a lack of fuel supplies through Israel, its manager warned on Thursday.  bur-bs/mtp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Sadyr Japarov's journey from prison to presidential frontrunner is an example of the dramatic changes in political fortunes in the Central Asian country that is both more unpredictable and pluralistic than its authoritarian neighbours.  But critics of combative Japarov, who became acting leader during the October unrest, fear his victory could tip Kyrgyzstan towards the strongman rule dominant in the ex-Soviet region.  In the capital Bishkek, where cold winters usher in a thick blanket of smog courtesy of polluting heating systems and ageing transport, many voters said they intended to back Japarov at the ballot box.   ""Of course I am for Japarov,"" said 49-year-old Talant Samatov, who owns a small sewing shop.  He said he believes the 11-year sentence that Japarov received in 2017 for taking a government official hostage was unfair.  ""He experienced deep injustice and now he will become a just leader for us,"" Samatov said.    In addition to picking a new president Kyrgyz are choosing between parliamentary and presidential forms of government, with Japarov backing greater powers for the post he is seeking.  Voting begins at 8:00 am (0200 GMT) with first results expected shortly after polling stations close at 8:00 pm (1400 GMT).    - Crime, corruption -    Japarov, who was sprung from jail by supporters during the crisis before a court overturned his conviction, has styled himself as an uncompromising opponent of organised crime and systemic corruption.  He has poured scorn on critics, some of whom have speculated that criminal networks are behind his rise for power.  But he struck a unifying tone in his last campaign appearance on Friday in Bishkek.  ""Let us come together... treat each other with understanding and respect. We are one country, one people,"" he told a crowd of several thousand people.  With a threadbare economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Kyrgyzstan's next leader is likely to be even more dependent on goodwill from allies Russia -- a destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrants -- and neighbouring economic giant China.  Russian President Vladimir Putin recently described the overthrow of the previous government as a ""misfortune"".  At his end of year press-conference Putin chided Kyrgyz politicians for attempting to imitate Western democracies.  Beijing's ambassador met with Kyrgyz officials several times last year to discuss protection for Chinese businesses, some of which were attacked during the unrest.    - Level playing field? -    Mountainous Kyrgyzstan's votes are more competitive than in its ex-Soviet neighbours, but they have rarely offered an even playing field.  The crisis that allowed for Japarov's overnight rehabilitation and rise to power was sparked by vote-buying campaigns favouring parties close to former president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.  Jeenbekov resigned less than two weeks later at the insistence of Japarov's supporters and after agreeing to sign off on Japarov's election as prime minister by parliament.  It was the third time a Kyrgyz head of state has stepped down over street protests since independence in 1991.  While constitutional requirements saw Japarov abandon his positions to compete in Sunday's election, rivals have complained that his campaign has benefited from the resources of the state, where his allies now occupy top posts.   On Friday the national security committee said it was investigating evidence that ""certain presidential candidates and their supporters"" were planning unrest after the vote, but did not name the candidates.     Bekjol Nurmatov, a 77-year-old retiree, accused Japarov of ""plunging the people into chaos"" last year and complained his campaign was using ""administrative resources"" to win votes in the Osh region from which Nurmatov hails.      The pensioner noted that Japarov had failed to show up for televised debates between candidates. He said he would vote instead for presidential rival Adakhan Madumarov, also from the Osh region.   ""Madumarov is a worthy candidate, the retiree said, accusing frontrunner Japarov of ""hiding from the people.""  tol-cr/jbr/cdw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024']

The Wall Street Journal said FBI agents removed 11 sets of classified documents from Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in the raid, which ignited a political firestorm in an already bitterly divided country.  The newspaper said some of the documents were marked ""top secret"" and were ""meant to be only available in special government facilities."" It said a list of items removed included information about the ""President of France.""  The Journal said the list was contained in a seven-page document that also includes the warrant to search the palatial Trump estate in Palm Beach.  The Justice Department has asked a Florida judge to unseal the search warrant on Friday barring objections from Trump, who is weighing another White House run in 2024.  The 76-year-old Trump said he would not block the release of the warrant while complaining that he was the victim of ""unprecedented political weaponization of law enforcement"" by ""radical left Democrats.""  Trump and his lawyers have actually had a copy of the search warrant and the receipt listing the property seized by FBI agents for days and they could have revealed the contents previously themselves.  The Wall Street Journal said FBI agents carted away around 20 boxes of items including binders of photos, a handwritten note and the grant of clemency made by Trump to Roger Stone, an ally of the former president.  The Washington Post on Thursday cited anonymous sources close to the investigation as saying classified documents relating to nuclear weapons were among the papers sought by FBI agents during the raid.  Trump himself appeared to deny the claim, posting that the ""nuclear weapons issue is a hoax"" and even suggesting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation might have been ""planting information"" at his home.    - 'Personally approved' -    The highly unusual move to unseal the search warrant was announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland -- the country's top law enforcement officer -- who said he had ""personally approved"" the raid on Trump's home.  Garland said he had asked a Florida judge to unseal the warrant because of ""substantial public interest in this matter,"" and he gave Trump and his legal team until 3:00 pm (1900 GMT) Friday to oppose the motion.  Leading Republicans have rallied around Trump and some members of his party have accused the Justice Department and FBI of partisanship in targeting the ex-president.  In an attack that appeared to be a direct response to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, an armed man tried to storm an FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Thursday.  The assailant, who was shot dead by police after exchanges of gunfire and an hours-long standoff, reportedly posted on Trump's Truth Social platform that he hoped his actions would serve as a ""call to arms.""  Garland on Thursday criticized what he called ""unfounded attacks"" on the FBI and Justice Department while FBI Director Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee, denounced ""violence and threats against law enforcement.""  The Justice Department typically does not confirm or deny whether it is investigating someone, and Garland took pains to emphasize the law was being applied fairly to Trump.  In a statement on Thursday, Trump said his attorneys had been ""cooperating fully"" and ""the government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it.""

""When I ended our military mission in Afghanistan almost a year ago, I made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan,"" Biden told the nation late Monday as he announced the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri.  ""I made a promise to the American people that we'd continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations... We've done just that.""  Announcing jihadist leader deaths has become a ritual -- both somber and highly political -- for presidents ever since the attacks of September 11, 2001.  Barack Obama's 2011 revelation of the daring operation to kill Osama bin Laden in his home in Pakistan electrified the nation. On hearing Obama, a skilled orator, people poured into the streets, chanting ""USA!""  Donald Trump took a different approach in 2019, using gory language to deliver news of a raid to kill Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi in Syria -- and to bolster his own strong man image.  ""He died like a dog,"" Trump said.  For Biden, the setting was inauspicious. Isolating from a case of rebound Covid-19, battered in the polls and facing the anniversary this month of the traumatic August 2021 exit of US troops from Kabul, the Democrat is in a weak position.  In a nod to Covid ventilation measures, his speech was delivered from the noisy balcony of the Blue Room. As he touted American resilience, Washington police sirens wailed in the background.  Yet the timing of the speech could not have been better for a president seeking to change the narrative.  While steering clear of triumphalism, Biden noted that Zawahiri had been on the wanted list ""for years under presidents (George W.) Bush, Obama and Trump.""  The implication -- that the country is safe in Biden's hands -- was clear.  ""No matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out,"" Biden said.    - Afghan strategy debate -    Critics on the right and left see last year's US withdrawal from Kabul as a show of ineptitude that, in addition to being a humiliating spectacle, will make Afghanistan a hotbed of anti-American Islamic groups, similar to the time of 9/11.  Biden argues he had the courage to pull the plug on a failed war conducted by three previous presidents and that there simply was never going to be a neat ending to the debacle.  Dismissing skeptics, he also promised that American ""over the horizon"" capabilities meant there'd be no more need to risk US lives on the ground.  Now with the Zawahiri killing, Biden has a golden opportunity to say that he's been proved right.  Afghanistan ""can't be a launching pad against the United States,"" Biden said in his speech. ""This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can, and we'll always make good on the solemn pledge.""    - Downsides -    There was instant praise from even unlikely quarters, with the anchor on the often hostile Fox News' evening broadcast calling it ""President Biden's bin Laden moment"" and ""a huge, huge win for the US.""  Some experts, however, caution against the White House spin.  James Jeffrey, a former US ambassador to Iraq and now chair of the Wilson Center think tank's Middle East Program, applauded the demonstration of ""excellent intelligence, an operational strike capability and decisiveness.""  However, that expertise does not outweigh the ""chaos"" of last year's Afghan withdrawal, which Jeffrey blamed on poor coordination and Biden's ""handicapping"" of staff through his refusal to accept there could be any downsides to pulling out -- or to plan for them.  Nathan Sales, another former diplomat who works at the Atlantic Council, said Zawahiri's mere presence in Kabul was a failure for the United States, suggesting ""as feared, the Taliban is once more granting safe haven to the leaders of Al-Qaeda.""  And it's too early to say whether one spectacular drone strike ""can be replicated against other terrorist targets,"" he said.  ""Until we know more, we should resist the urge to see the strike as a vindication of 'over the horizon' counterterrorism.""  Biden, however, is so far getting overall good marks. Among those cheering Tuesday was Bill McRaven, who as then-commander of US special operations oversaw the bin Laden raid.  ""What the US has shown is that we can in fact do over the horizon targeting on certain high value individuals,"" he told CNN.  sms/bfm","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113379121', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']"

Results published by the ex-Soviet country's Central Election Commission (CEC) showed Japarov with close to 80 percent of the vote after nearly all the ballots were counted.  The results of a referendum held in parallel showed Kyrgyz strongly preferring presidential rule, which would grant Japarov sweeping powers when a new constitution is passed, most probably later this year.  Just over 10 percent supported parliamentarian rule.  The referendum vote spells the end for a mixed political system adopted in 2010 to tame authoritarianism after two successive strongman presidents were ejected from power during street protests.  Japarov, 52, was serving jail time on hostage-taking charges when protests in October saw him freed by supporters and propelled to the top of the political pyramid.  CEC data Sunday showed his closest competitor trailing with less than 7 percent.  The crisis that allowed for Japarov's overnight rehabilitation and rise to power was sparked by vote-buying campaigns favouring parties close to former president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.  Jeenbekov resigned at the insistence of Japarov's supporters and after agreeing to sign off on Japarov's election as prime minister by parliament.  Japarov also became acting president following the resignation during the political chaos that worried key allies Russia and China, but he stepped down from both roles to compete in the vote.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024']

The overnight strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine also injured 11 people, with five reported to be in a serious condition.  ""It was a terrible night,"" regional governor Valentin Reznichenko wrote on Telegram, urging residents to shelter when they hear air raid sirens.  ""I am asking and begging you... Don't let the Russians kill you,"" he wrote, adding that Russia had fired a total of 80 rockets at the area.  Most of the casualties were in the town of Marganets, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest.  Regional council head Mykola Lukashuk said the strikes had hit a local power line, leaving thousands of people without electricity.    - G7 call over nuclear plant -    Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of recent shelling around the plant, which has six reactors.  Ukraine says Russia has stationed hundreds of troops and stored ammunition at the facility since taking it over on March 4, shortly after starting its invasion.  The tensions have brought back memories of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in then Soviet Ukraine, which killed hundreds of people and spread radioactive contamination over much of Europe.  The Group of Seven industrialised nations condemned Russia's occupation and called on Moscow to immediately hand back full control of the plant.  Ukrainian staff operating the plant ""must be able to carry out their duties without threats or pressure. It is Russia's continued control of the plant that endangers the region,"" the G7 foreign ministers said in a statement.  The strikes came a day after major blasts at the Saki airfield, a key military base on the Russian-annexed Crimea peninsula.  Moscow insisted that the explosions were caused by detonating ammunition rather than Ukrainian fire and Ukraine has not claimed responsibility.    - 'There is a lot of shooting' -    Fighting also ground on in eastern Ukraine, where Russian troops are gradually advancing.  The city of Soledar was under constant shelling, AFP reporters saw, as Russian troops attempted to drive out Ukrainian forces and seize a foothold towards the larger city of Bakhmut.  The echoes of cluster bombs and artillery bounced off apartment buildings with their windows shattered, while roads were cratered and shops boarded up or destroyed.  The city was shrouded with black and white smoke arising from artillery and air strikes.  Some of those who remain now live their lives underground in cellars ill-suited as bomb shelters.  ""Most have left. It's very scary. There is a lot of shooting,"" said 62-year-old Svitlana Klymenko.  ""I just want to leave to grow old in a normal way, die a normal death, not be killed by a missile.""    - Vienna dims street lights -    The war has severely hampered grain supply from Ukraine, leading to an international food crisis as it is one of the world's biggest producers.  Some ships have been able to leave Ukrainian ports in recent days after a deal with Russia brokered by the United Nations and Turkey.  The first grain shipment to leave on the Sierra Leone-flagged vessel Razoni departed the Ukrainian port of Odessa on August 1 and had been expected to dock in the Lebanese port of Tripoli at the weekend.  But the Ukrainian embassy said a new buyer for the shipment was being sought after the original Lebanese buyer cancelled the order.  A five-month delay after Russia's invasion ""prompted the buyer and the shipping agent to reach agreement on the cancellation of the order,"" the Ukraine embassy said in a statement late Tuesday.  It is currently anchored off the Turkish port of Mersin.  Western countries have meanwhile imposed increasingly stringent sanctions on Russia, raising fears that Russia may cut off gas supplies.  EU countries have started putting into place different measures to save energy, with air conditioning curbs coming into force in Spain on Wednesday and Vienna dimming street lighting.  bur-dt/kjm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

The lightning hit Lafayette Square, a small park across the street from the White House, shortly before 7:00 pm (2300 GMT) Thursday, leaving two men and two women with ""critical life-threatening injuries,"" according to a statement from Washington's fire and emergencies department.  All the victims were taken to local hospitals, but on Friday morning the Metropolitan Police confirmed that two of them -- 75-year-old Donna Mueller and 76-year-old James Mueller, from Janesville in Wisconsin -- had been pronounced dead.   The couple had been high school sweethearts and were in the capital to mark their wedding anniversary, their niece Michelle McNett told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

US Secret Service and park police rushed to help the four after witnessing the strike, fire and emergency services department spokesman Vito Maggiolo said in a statement posted on social media.

For one, his twice-impeached predecessor Donald Trump was absent, having fled Washington hours earlier, leaving Vice President Mike Pence to represent the White House in the two-century-old process that ensures the continuity of government.  Also missing: the massive crowds of people who normally converge on the National Mall on Inauguration Day, replaced by thousands of flags representing the 400,000 Americans who have died from the coronavirus, and those unable to attend the inauguration.  The Capitol's front lawn was in effect deserted, save for a few hundred diplomats, official guests and family who braved high winds, chilly temperatures and a snow shower to see Biden sworn in as the 46th president.  ""That mall is not empty,"" House Democrat John Garamendi insisted to AFP as he eyed the flag-covered expanse.  ""In the age of Covid, in the age of Trump, we can't be here,"" he said, but ""that mall is full of America's hope.""   Beyond a black metal fence ringing the Capitol grounds, rows of National Guard troops stood at attention, heavily armed sentries preventing any repeat of the violence that rocked Capitol Hill on January 6.  Bleacher seats normally reserved for high-profile guests were one third full on account of social distancing measures that relegated lawmakers like House Republican Jim Jordan and Senator-elect Jon Ossoff to a level below the stage.  Up on the inaugural platform, Marine Corps musicians trumpeted the arrival of Biden, who fist-bumped Barack Obama, whom he served as vice president for eight years.   Pence was seen chatting with former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  He also exchanged a few words with incoming Vice President Kamala Harris, who made history as the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to rise to the office -- and who may be a Pence presidential rival in 2024.    - 'Goodbye to 2020' -    After he was sworn in, Biden -- who called for national unity in his inauguration speech as well as for a moment of silence to honor those lost to Covid -- made a point of speaking with Senator Mitch McConnell.  The powerful Republican in recent days broke with Trump and warned against efforts to overturn the election.  Ossoff, whose shock run-off election win earlier this month in Georgia helped Democrats seize control of the US Senate, expressed optimism that America's ""bedrock of democracy"" will win out despite the recent turmoil.  ""We are turning the page on these last four years and now we need to unite this country to defeat this virus and get economic relief to the people,"" he said.  For former US House speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican driven out by more rightwing factions of his party in 2018, the security detail was ""surreal.""   But he encapsulated what many at the inauguration were no doubt thinking.  ""I'm just happy to have 2021 and say goodbye to 2020,"" Ryan told AFP.   ""It's important to pay respect to our process -- which stood against tests we've never seen in our lifetimes, and it passed those tests.""  BreYhana Johnson, a 23-year-old Senate staff assistant and member of Harris' historically black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, said she was ""so grateful"" to see Harris make history -- and to witness the transition of power after the Capitol riot.  ""Even though we went through such an... act of domestic terrorism, the show must go on,"" Johnson said. ""We're still carrying on here today and hate is not going to win.""

State fire department, CalFire, said that while the weather had ""mitigated fire spread,"" vegetation in the area ""remains extremely dry"" and in danger of being ignited by lightning strikes.   ""The continued threat of thunderstorms and the associated strong, erratic winds could result in increased fire behavior,"" CalFire said.  The McKinney fire burning in the Klamath National Forest near the border with Oregon is California's largest wildfire so far this year -- though it remains much smaller than last year's Dixie Fire, which burned nearly one million acres.  More than 55,000 acres (22,000 hectares) of the sparsely populated forest have been ravaged and the blaze is zero percent contained, according to CalFire.  Firefighters are constructing containment lines to prevent the fire from spreading, including using bulldozers to build a firebreak to protect Yreka, the county seat of Siskiyou County.  The McKinney Fire has killed two people, according to the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office.  Firefighters found two people dead on Sunday inside a burned-out car in the driveway of a home in the town of Klamath River.  Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue said the pair were likely caught in the swift-moving blaze as they tried to flee.  Sherri Marchetti-Perrault, who lived off of Highway 96, told the Los Angeles Times that her home had burned to the ground.  ""When we left, everything was on fire,"" Marchetti-Perrault told the newspaper. ""It happened so fast. We left with the clothes on our back. We couldn't breathe and we couldn't see.""    - 'Holding out' -     California, along with much of the western United States, is in the grip of its worst drought in more than 1,000 years.  The drought, exacerbated by man-made climate change, has left the countryside parched and vulnerable to the wildfires that naturally break out, making the blazes hotter, faster and more destructive.  California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency in Siskiyou County, and more than 2,000 residents of the rural area are under evacuation orders.  According to the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office, the fire has destroyed more than 100 structures -- including homes, a grocery store and a community center -- in the area around Yreka.  ""Surrounding areas should be ready to leave if needed. Please don't hesitate to evacuate,"" the county sheriff tweeted.  ""I'm holding out trying not to leave too soon because I'm helping out my mom,"" said Rafael Franco, who lives in the mandatory evacuation area.  ""She's not in the best physical health to get around,"" Franco told AFP.  ""At the last minute if I see the fire cross the ridge where we are, we are going to head out and grab what we can and get going and hope for the best.""  Marjie Lawrence, who fled Klamath River on Friday night, said she went back to retrieve some belongings in case the fire spread to her home.   ""We are taking stuff in case the house goes, we are taking things we want, but not too many,"" Lawrence said.  The McKinney Fire comes just days after the Oak Fire near Yosemite National Park destroyed dozens of buildings and forced thousands to evacuate.  California still has months of fire season ahead of it.  Other parts of the world have also faced intense wildfires this year, as scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent and more intense, increasing the risk of fires.  bur-cl/sw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113954165']

Once the residence of French kings and among Europe's best-preserved monuments of its kind, the castle is for the most part open to the public, including for tours, concerts, theatre plays and other events.  It also houses part of the French armed forces' historical archives, to which access is restricted.  Technically therefore a military installation, it is covered by a French ban on Russian nationals entering army territory that was issued after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.  Applying the rule, security guards at the Chateau de Vincennes denied two Russian women access to the monument on July 28.  ""A guard at the metal detector asked to see my passport,"" said one of the women, 31, who works as a journalist and has been in France for five months, having left Russia ""precisely because I am opposed to the war"".  On inspecting the document, the guard informed her she couldn't pass, the woman, who asked not to be named, told AFP.  Another guard also denied her entry and gave as the reason ""because you are Russian"", she said, adding she couldn't believe what she was hearing.    - U-turn -    Contacted by AFP on Monday, the defence ministry confirmed that it had, indeed, ""restricted access to military installations to Russian nationals"" because of the invasion.  But after media coverage and social media comment, the ministry contacted AFP on Tuesday to say that the guards had in fact ""indiscriminately applied a rule established in February concerning all military installations"".  ""This rule cannot be applied in the same way for strategic sites and for sites accessible to the public, such as museums,"" a spokesman said.  The ministry said security staff would now be informed of the distinction ""to avoid any further incidents of this kind"".  Each year some 150,000 people visit the chateau, paying 9.50 euros ($9.70) per adult admission.  Other tourist sites run by the army, including the Air and Space Museum in Le Bourget and Les Invalides in Paris, would also allow Russians in, the ministry official said.    Since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February, France has taken in some 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, government figures show.  About 73,500 Russian immigrants lived in France in 2021, according to the national statistics office Insee.  There has been debate within the European Union about whether further limits should be placed on Russians visiting the bloc for tourism or personal reasons.    Russia's neighbour Finland last week issued a plan to limit tourist visas for Russians but also emphasised the need for an EU-level decision on the matter.

In a somber televised address, Biden said he gave the final go-ahead for the high-precision strike that successfully targeted Zawahiri in the Afghan capital over the weekend.  ""Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said, adding that he hoped Zawahiri's death would bring ""closure"" to families of the 3,000 people killed in the United States on 9/11.  A senior administration official said Zawahiri was on the balcony of a house in Kabul when he was targeted with two Hellfire missiles, an hour after sunrise on July 31, and that there had been no US boots on the ground in Afghanistan.  ""We are not aware of him ever leaving the safe house. We identified Zawahiri on multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony of where he was ultimately struck,"" the official said.   According to the official's account, the president gave his green light for the strike on July 25 -- as he was recovering in isolation from Covid-19. Biden said there were no civilian casualties in the operation.   It was the first known over-the-horizon strike by the United States on an Al-Qaeda target in Afghanistan since American forces withdrew from the country on August 31, 2021.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday evening that ""by hosting and sheltering"" Zawahiri, the Taliban had ""grossly violated the Doha Agreement"" signed in 2020, which paved the way for America's withdrawal.  Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run for 20 years since the 9/11 attacks.  He took over Al-Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.  Over the weekend the Afghan interior ministry denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike in Kabul, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in the capital, causing no casualties.  Early Tuesday in Kabul, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out on a residence in the Sherpur area of the city.  ""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first. The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones,"" his tweet said.  The news comes a month before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the control of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces over the preceding two decades.  Under the 2020 Doha deal, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke its ties with Al-Qaeda.  ""What we know is that the senior Haqqani Taliban were aware of his presence in Kabul,"" the Biden official said.   Taliban interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani also heads the feared Haqqani Network, a brutal subset of the Taliban blamed for some of the worst violence of the past 20 years and which has been described by US officials as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence.    - Doctor turned jihadist -    Zawahiri, 71, lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world, but willingly channeled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.  He was believed to be the main strategist -- the real mastermind who steered operations, including the September 11 attacks, as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.  Saudi Arabia, the home country of bin Laden as well as many of the 9/11 hijackers, welcomed the announcement of Zawahiri's death.  ""Thousands of innocent people of different nationalities and religions, including Saudi citizens, were killed,"" by terrorists under his leadership, the Saudi foreign ministry said.  Al-Qaeda is believed to have been degraded in the years since the US invasion of Afghanistan, and the White House official said Zawahiri was ""one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of significance.""  The organization, agreed Soufan Center researcher Colin Clarke, is ""at a crossroads.""  ""Despite Zawahiri's leadership, which minimized AQ's losses while rebuilding, the group still faces serious challenges going forward. For one, there's the question of who will lead al Qaeda after Zawahiri's gone,"" he said.  Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.  He became involved with Egypt's radical Muslim community at a young age and published several books which came for many to symbolize the radical Islamist movement.  He left Egypt in the mid-1980s, heading for Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar where the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based.  It was at that time, when thousands of Islamist fighters flooded into Afghanistan during the 1980s, that Zawahiri and bin Laden met, and in 1998 he became one of five signatories to bin Laden's ""fatwa"" calling for attacks against Americans.  Jihadist monitor SITE said some militants were questioning the veracity of the report he had been killed, while others believed Zawahiri had achieved his desire of ""martyrdom.""   As for Al-Qaeda's future without him, SITE said jihadists were bullish, with one writing: ""If Sheikh Ayman al-Zawahiri is dead, there are a thousand Aymans.""  sms-fox-pmh-st/ssy",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']

Zawahiri's assassination is the biggest blow to Al-Qaeda since US special forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, and calls into question the Taliban's promise not to harbour militant groups.  It was the first known over-the-horizon strike by the US on a target in Afghanistan since Washington withdrew its forces from the country on August 31 last year, days after the Taliban swept back to power.  The Taliban condemned the drone strike Tuesday, but made no mention of casualties nor did they name Zawahiri.  ""Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said in a sombre televised address, adding he hoped Zawahiri's death would bring ""closure"" to families of the 3,000 people killed in the US on September 11, 2001.  Zawahiri was believed to be the mastermind who steered Al-Qaeda's operations -- including the 9/11 attacks -- as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.  A senior administration official said the 71-year-old Egyptian was on the balcony of a three-storey house in the Afghan capital when targeted with two Hellfire missiles after dawn Sunday.  ""We identified Zawahiri on multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony where he was ultimately struck,"" the official said.   The house is in Sherpur, one of Kabul's most affluent neighbourhoods, with several villas occupied by high-ranking Taliban officials and commanders.  The Taliban's interior ministry previously denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in Kabul, causing no casualties.  Early Tuesday, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out.  ""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first,"" he said.  ""The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones.""    - 'Grossly violated' -    Although Biden did not mention the Taliban in his televised address, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""by hosting and sheltering"" Zawahiri, the Islamist group had ""grossly violated the Doha Agreement"" which paved the way for America's withdrawal.  Zabihullah, in turn, accused Washington of breaking the 2020 deal.  ""Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan, and the region,"" he said.  Zawahiri, who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run since the 9/11 attacks.  He took over Al-Qaeda after bin Laden was killed, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.  News of his death comes a month before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the hands of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces for two decades.  Under the Doha deal, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke ties with Al-Qaeda.

Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani also heads the feared Haqqani Network, a brutal subset of the Taliban blamed for some of the worst violence of the past 20 years and which has been described by US officials as a ""veritable arm"" of Pakistani intelligence.  In Sherpur, locals told AFP they long thought the targeted house  -- surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, and now with green tarpaulin covering the balcony where Zawahiri was believed to have been killed -- was empty.  ""We have not seen anybody living there for almost a year,"" said an employee of a nearby office.  ""It has always been in dark, with not a single bulb lit.""  Some residents found it hard to believe that Zawahiri had been hiding in their midst.  ""It's just propaganda,"" Fahim Shah, 66, told AFP.  ""They should show to the people and to the world that 'we had hit this man and here is the evidence,'"" added Abdul Kabir.    - Doctor turned jihadist -    Zawahiri lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.

The three countries have held multiple rounds of talks since Ethiopia broke ground on the project in 2011 but they have so far failed to produce an agreement on the filling and operation of the vast reservoir behind the 145-metre (475-foot) tall dam.  The last, held by video-conference in early November, broke up without making any headway.  Late last month, Egypt called in Ethiopia's charge d'affaires after its foreign ministry spokesman claimed the dam dispute had become a welcome distraction from domestic problems for the Cairo government.  Sudan's state news agency SUNA said that officials from current African Union chair South Africa would be involved in the new round of talks.  Citing an unnamed official, SUNA said Sudan would propose granting African Union experts a ""bigger role"" in the negotiations for a binding agreement on the dam's filling and operation.   Cairo has expressed fears that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam will severely reduce the Nile's flow, with devastating effects for the more than 97 million Egyptians dependent on it.  Ethiopia says the hydroelectric power produced at the dam is vital to meet the power needs of its even larger population.  It insists downstream countries' water supplies will not be affected.   Sudan, which suffered deadly floods last summer when the Blue Nile reached its highest level since records began more than a century ago, hopes that the new dam will help regulate the river's flow.

The British author, who spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders ordered his killing, underwent emergency surgery and was placed on a ventilator in a Pennsylvania hospital following Friday's assault. His agent said he will likely lose an eye.  President Joe Biden on Saturday called it a ""vicious"" attack and offered prayers for Rushdie's recovery.  ""Salman Rushdie -- with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced -- stands for essential, universal ideals. Truth. Courage. Resilience,"" Biden said in a statement.  ""We reaffirm our commitment to those deeply American values in solidarity with Rushdie and all those who stand for freedom of expression.""  On Friday, a 24-year-old man from New Jersey, Hadi Matar, rushed the stage where Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture and stabbed him in the neck and abdomen.  He has been formally charged with attempted murder, but police provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.  Beyond Rushdie's eye injury, the nerves in one of his arms were severed and his liver was damaged, according to his agent Andrew Wylie.  The 75-year-old novelist had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran's then supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.  The fatwa followed publication of the novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" which sparked fury among some Muslims who believed it was blasphemous.  In a recent interview with Germany's Stern magazine, Rushdie spoke of how, after so many years living with death threats, his life was ""getting back to normal.""  ""For whatever it was, eight or nine years, it was quite serious,"" he told a Stern correspondent in New York.  ""But ever since I've been living in America, since the year 2000, really there hasn't been a problem in all that time.""    - Assailant raised in US -    Rushdie moved to New York in the early 2000s and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  Security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community near Buffalo.  Witnesses said Rushdie was seated onstage and preparing to speak when Matar sprang up from the audience and managed to stab him several times before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators.  Matar's family apparently came from a border village called Yaroun in southern Lebanon.   An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there. Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.  Matar was ""born and raised in the US,"" the head of the local municipality, Ali Qassem Tahfa, told AFP.  ""The Satanic Verses"" and its author remain deeply inflammatory in Iran. When asked by AFP on Saturday, nobody in Tehran's main book market dared to openly condemn the stabbing.  ""I was very happy to hear the news,"" said Mehrab Bigdeli, a man in his 50s studying to become a Muslim cleric.  The message was similar in Iran's conservative media, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""  In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan -- a party that has staged violent protests against what it deems to be anti-Muslim blasphemy -- said Rushdie ""deserved to be killed.""  Elsewhere there was widespread shock and outrage.  British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack ""reprehensible"" and ""cowardly.""  Messages also flooded in from the literary world, with Joyce Carol Oates calling it ""terrible, tragic news"" and Rushdie's close friend Ian McEwan calling him an ""inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world.""    - Wrote memoir in hiding -    Rushdie was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel, ""Midnight's Children,"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" transformed his life. The resulting fatwa forced him into nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell even his children where he lived.  Even as the need for constant security began to diminish in the late 1990s, threats and boycotts continued against literary events that Rushdie attended.  Since moving to New York, Rushdie has been an outspoken advocate of freedom of speech and has continued writing -- including a memoir, ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding.  bur/bbk-sst/bfm   THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

The ambitious reform of medical insurance, better known as ""Obamacare,"" was the flagship law of former president Barack Obama, with whom Biden served as vice president.

However, around 26 million people remain without health coverage in the country.

Biden will sign 17 orders and actions just hours after being sworn in as US leader to break from policies of departing President Donald Trump and set new paths on immigration, the environment, fighting Covid-19 and the economy, they said.  In first-day moves, he will end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.  He will also set a mask mandate on federal properties to stem the spread of Covid-19; restore protections of valuable nature reserves removed by Trump; and seek freezes on evictions and protection for millions behind on their mortgages due to the coronavirus pandemic.  He also plans to send a bill to Congress to revamp immigration policies and give millions of undocumented migrants living inside the country a path to citizenship that the Trump administration denied.  Biden's staff said he wanted to hit the ground running given the deep health and economic challenges facing the country.  Biden ""will take action -- not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration -- but also to start moving our country forward,"" the aides said in a statement.  ""These actions are bold, begin the work of following through on President-elect Biden's promises to the American people, and, importantly, fall within the constitutional role for the president.""    - New approach to Covid -    Many of the actions will take government policies back to where they were on January 19, 2017 -- the final day of the Barack Obama-Joe Biden administration, before Trump entered office and took a wrecking ball to many of their initiatives.  Jeff Zients, the new president's point-man for fighting the pandemic, said Biden would start by establishing an office of Covid-19 response inside the White House.  A 100-day ""masking challenge"" will be led with a presidential order for wearing masks in all federal properties and activities, setting the standard for private companies, individual states and communities to follow suit, Zients said.  Wednesday ""starts a new day, a new, different approach to managing the country's response to Covid-19 crisis,"" he said.  That includes reversing Trump's decision to leave the World Health Organization.  To underscore Biden's decision, Zients said, leading US coronavirus expert Anthony Fauci will lead a delegation to take part in the WHO Executive Board meeting on Thursday.  ""America's withdrawal from the international arena has impeded progress on the global response and left us more vulnerable to future pandemics,"" he said.  Gina McCarthy, the new administration's chief climate advisor, said returning to the 2016 Paris accord was essential to making fighting climate change a central tenet of Biden administration policy.  Biden will reverse Trump decisions to ease emissions and efficiency standards, and rescind the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, a large project that would bring relatively high-polluting Canadian oil into the United States.  ""The day-one climate executive orders will begin to put the US back on the right footing, a footing we need to restore American leadership, helping to position our nation to be the global leader in clean energy and jobs,"" said McCarthy.

""(It's) all in good condition and we're now examining the data,"" National Transportation Safety Committee head Soerjanto Tjahjono said in a statement.   The recorder, which holds information about the speed, altitude and direction of the plane, could supply critical clues as to why the aircraft plunged about 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) in less than a minute before crashing into waters off Jakarta on Saturday.  A rescue party near the capital's coast has worked for days to salvage human remains and wreckage from the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500, as well as two flight recorders.  More than 3,000 people are taking part in the recovery effort, assisted by dozens of boats and helicopters.  Divers on Tuesday hauled the data recorder to the surface, with the hunt now focused on finding a cockpit voice recorder on the wreckage-littered seabed.  The 26-year-old plane crashed just four minutes after setting off from Jakarta, bound for Pontianak city on Borneo island, a 90-minute flight away.  Authorities said the crew did not declare an emergency or report technical problems with the plane before its dive, and that it was probably intact when it hit the water -- citing a relatively small area where the wreckage was scattered.  The crash probe was likely to take months, but a preliminary report was expected in 30 days.  Indonesia's fast-growing aviation sector has long been plagued by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from US and European airspace.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.  That accident -- and another in Ethiopia -- led to the grounding of the 737 MAX worldwide over a faulty anti-stall system.  The 737 that went down Saturday was first produced decades ago and was not a MAX variant.  bur-pb/rma/leg   BOEING",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

""Mank"" earned six nods, including best drama, followed by fellow Netflix movie ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" on five, in an announcement that offered an important, early glimpse into the movies leading this year's unique awards season.  The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which has only previously nominated five female directors in its long history, gave Globes nods to three women in the category this year.  The unveiling of the nominations -- remotely co-hosted by ""Sex and the City"" star Sarah Jessica Parker and Taraji P Henson -- whittled down the list of films and stars headed for the Globes ceremony later this month -- itself seen as a bellwether for the Oscars in April.  As expected, pandemic-related theater closures and blockbuster delays boosted smaller, stay-at-home movies from streamers this year, as Netflix thrashed all its competition with a whopping 22 film nominations -- up from an impressive 17 last year.  Rival Amazon Prime was in second place with seven film nominations, including three apiece for ""One Night in Miami"" and ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.""  Sacha Baron Cohen starred in the sequel to his mockumentary about a fictional Kazakh journalist, and earned a second nomination for his supporting work in ""Chicago 7.""  But a small batch of prestige titles from Tinseltown's traditional major studios held their own, with Disney's ""Nomadland,"" Sony's ""The Father"" and Universal's ""Promising Young Woman"" each earning four nods.  #MeToo revenge thriller ""Promising Young Woman"" in particular exceeded expectations with recognition for best drama, director, screenplay and actress for Carey Mulligan.  Mulligan will compete with Viola Davis for 1920s blues drama ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" as well as Frances McDormand for ""Nomadland.""  In the acting categories, late ""Black Panther"" star Chadwick Boseman was also nominated for ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" but missed out on a second nods for Spike Lee's ""Da 5 Bloods.""  The fiercely competitive best actor in a drama category will also feature heavyweights such as Anthony Hopkins for ""The Father,"" adapted from a French play about dementia, and Gary Oldman for ""Mank.""    - Female directors break through -    Last year, the HFPA was slammed for its failure to nominate any female directors, but this year, Chloe Zhao (""Nomadland""), Regina King (""One Night in Miami"") and Emerald Fennell (""Promising Young Woman"") all earned nominations.  Only five women had been nominated for best director in Globes history previously.  Surprisingly, Meryl Streep missed out on a nomination for Netflix musical ""The Prom.""  Disney+'s ""Hamilton,"" created from multiple performances featuring the original Broadway cast, earned two nominations, including best musical or comedy film, and best actor for creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.  It is not allowed to compete at the Oscars, meaning the Globes represent the best chance for the Tony-winning musical about the US founding fathers to scoop up film accolades.  Foreign-language films, separated out into their own Globes pool, saw acclaimed Korean-American family drama ""Minari"" nominated as it bids to emulate last year's all-conquering ""Parasite.""  In the television categories, Netflix was again dominant, scoring 20 nominations against closest rival HBO's seven.  The latest season of British royal family drama ""The Crown"" had the most recognition with six, ahead of recent Emmys smash hit ""Schitt's Creek"" on five.

The quake produced powerful shaking along parts of Japan's eastern coast, and was felt strongly in Tokyo, but triggered no tsunami alert.  Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters that no major casualties were reported, according to Kyodo news agency, which reported that more than 50 people had been injured, but he gave no further details.   There were no immediate reports of significant damage, though local news broadcast images of a landslide on a highway.  Japan's meteorological agency said the quake hit at 11:08 pm (1408 GMT) at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific off Fukushima -- near the epicentre of the 2011 killer quake which triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000 people.  The agency initially reported the strength of the quake as 7.1, but later revised the figure upwards. It said the quake was considered an aftershock of the massive 2011 temblor.  Aftershocks continued to rattle the region in the hours afterward and officials cautioned local residents to be vigilant. A handful of people were reported to have sought shelter at evacuation centres.  ""We are working quickly to collect information but we still have no details to announce. There were some unconfirmed reports about landslides but we are still checking,"" Mikihiro Meguro, an official from the Fukushima prefectural government, told AFP.  Around 950,000 homes lost power throughout the affected region, but no abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.  Suga, who was called to his office over the earthquake, told journalists his cabinet will meet at 9:00 am Sunday for a briefing, Kyodo said.   Broadcaster NHK added that the government would set up a special liaison office to coordinate with affected regions.    - 'All messed up' -    Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato addressed reporters after midnight and said evaluations were under way.  ""As far as damage, casualties and structural damage are being assessed,"" he said, adding that sections of the bullet train had been suspended due to power outages.  ""Surveys are being done at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,"" he said.  ""We have received reports that Onagawa nuclear plant and Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant are not showing any abnormality,"" he added.  Images posted online showed broken glass at a shop and items spilled off the shelves at a supermarket.  Tomoko Kobayashi who works at a traditional inn in Fukushima's Minamisoma city told Kyodo that ""the initial jolt felt more powerful than the one I experienced in the Great East Japan Earthquake"" of 2011.  Renowned author Yu Miri, who also lives in Minamisoma, tweeted a photo of her home, showing books, potted plants and other belongings strewn across the floor.  ""My house in Odaka, Minamisoma city is all messed up,"" she wrote.  ""I hear the ground rumbling. And another quake,"" she tweeted about an aftershock.  Aerial footage broadcast by NHK showed a landslide onto a highway in Fukushima region, severing the road. It was not immediately clear if anyone was hurt.  The US Geological Survey registered the quake at a revised magnitude of 7.1 with a depth of 51 kilometers.   Japan sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.  The country is regularly hit by quakes, and has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong tremors.  In September 2018, a powerful 6.6-magnitude quake rocked Hokkaido, triggering landslides, collapsing houses and killing more than 40.  si-hih/sah/bfm/dw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105477226']

The KMT flee to the island of Taiwan and form their own government in Taipei in December, cutting off contacts with mainland China.  In 1950, Taiwan becomes an ally of the United States, which is at war with communist China in Korea. The US deploys a fleet in the Taiwan Strait to protect its ally from possible attack.    - 1971: Beijing gets UN, US nods -    In October 1971, Beijing takes over China's seat at the United Nations, previously held by Taipei.   In 1979, the United States cuts formal ties with Taiwan and establishes diplomatic relations with Beijing instead.   Washington goes on to develop a nuanced Taiwan policy were it ""acknowledges"" China's claim to the island, which is not the same as accepting Beijing's claim of sovereignty.  The US also maintains trade and military ties with Taipei. It opposes both Taiwanese independence and any attempt by China to forcibly take the island.    - 1987-2004: relations improve -    In late 1987, Taiwan residents are for the first time permitted to visit mainland China, allowing families to reunite.  In 1991, Taiwan lifts emergency rule, unilaterally ending a state of war with China. The first direct talks between the two sides are held in Singapore two years later.  But in 1995, Beijing suspends talks in protest at a visit by Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui to the United States.  In 1996, China tests missiles off Taiwan to deter voters in the island's first democratic presidential election.  In 2000 elections, the KMT loses power in Taiwan for the first time. Over the next few years trade links between the two sides improve.    - 2005-2015: threats and talks -    In March 2005, Beijing adopts a law authorising the use of force if Taiwan declares independence. In April, KMT chairman Lien Chan makes a landmark visit to Beijing for talks with Chinese leader Hu Jintao.  In 2008, Taiwan and China resume high-level talks after the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou is elected president on a Beijing-friendly platform.  In 2010, they sign a sweeping Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement and in 2014 hold the first government-to-government talks since separation.    - 2016: honeymoon over -    In January 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, from the traditionally pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, wins presidential elections.   In June, China suspends all communications with Taiwan after the new government fails to acknowledge the ""One China"" policy.  In December 2016, US president-elect Donald Trump breaks with decades of US diplomatic policy by speaking directly, by telephone, with Tsai.  In January 2019, Xi Jinping says that the unification of China and Taiwan is ""inevitable"".    - 2021: US-China tensions -    In 2021, Chinese military jets make hundreds of incursions into Taiwan's defence zone.  In October, US President Joe Biden says the United States will defend Taiwan if China attacks it, in comments later partly walked back by the White House.  Tsai confirms that a small number of US troops are present in Taiwan to help train its forces.    - 2022: Pelosi visit sparks fury -    On August 2, after days of speculation and stern warnings from Beijing of unspecified ""consequences"", US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lands in Taiwan during a tour of Asia.  The highest-profile elected US official to visit the island in 25 years says her visit demonstrates her country's ""unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan's vibrant democracy"".  A furious China vows ""punishment"" and launches its largest-ever military exercises in the area, encircling Taiwan on August 4.   The exercises include the deployment of fighter jets and warships, and the firing of ballistic missiles.  doc-kd-cb/aha",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113435201']

Dugin -- an outspoken ultranationalist intellectual and a vocal supporter of the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine -- is thought to have been the likely target of the attack.   ""The crime was prepared and committed by Ukrainian special services,"" the FSB said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.   It added that the perpetrator -- a female Ukrainian citizen born in 1979 -- on Sunday fled to EU member Estonia.  Daria Dugina was killed Saturday when a bomb placed in a Toyota Land Cruiser went off as she drove on a highway some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside Moscow.

The seasonally adjusted figure for the week ended January 16 was worse than expected and just 26,000 less than the previous week's downwardly revised level.   It was also still well above the single worst week of the 2008-2010 global financial crisis, during which Biden served as vice president under Barack Obama.  Adding to the toll were 423,734 new filings made under a program for self-employed people not normally eligible for benefits, while as of the week of January 2, the Labor Department said nearly 16 million people were receiving some form of aid from the government -- a figure that's expected to rise.

The arrest of Navalny at a Moscow airport last month, following months of medical treatment in Germany, prompted an outcry from the European Union and key member states who believe he was poisoned in the summer by the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.  The tensions come at a period of turbulence in Russia unusual in Putin's two-decade grip on power, with police arresting thousands in two successive weekends of mass nationwide protests in support of the Kremlin critic.  But analysts expect the EU to still keep talking to Putin, even if Navalny's situation will further darken a climate already bedevilled by Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, claims of election meddling and alleged assassination plots on European territory.  ""The arrest of Navalny may indeed lead to a further deterioration of EU-Russia ties and particularly those between Germany and Russia,"" said Andras Racz and Milan Nic in a report on Russian foreign policy for the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP).  They said that Moscow was ""losing interest"" in dealing with Europe while China under President Xi Jinping has emerged as ""Russia's sole great power partner in international affairs.""  Europe needs to ""intelligently manage"" a situation without any prospect of strategic improvement in the short or medium term but where there could be chances to cooperate on issues including global warming, the Arctic and the Covid-19 pandemic, they said.    - 'Macron's error' -    In a key test for the temperature of relations, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell will travel to Russia on Thursday for talks in the first such visit since 2017.  The poisoning and subsequent imprisonment of Navalny have also largely derailed a bid by French President Emmanuel Macron for a rapprochement with Russia under Putin.  The French leader's main achievements have been limited to chairing a 2019 summit that helped a July 2020 ceasefire that has sharply reduced fighting in the east of Ukraine.  Further EU sanctions against senior Russian officials will now be on the agenda but the big question is if Germany is willing to put the Nordstream II gas pipeline project at stake.  Putting the ball firmly in Berlin's court and hinting of splits within the EU, France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France Inter radio on Monday that Paris had the ""greatest doubts"" over the project and had already asked Berlin to scrap it.  Francois Heisbourg, special advisor at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London and the Foundation for Strategic Research (FRS) in Paris, said the West was prepared to inflict more ""reputational damage"" on Russia with sanctions but would not go to the brink on the issue.  He said Macron and other European leaders were uneasy over Russia's partnership with China and would like to see it disappear, ""but the error of Macron is to believe the Europeans have the means to hasten this.""      - 'No choice' -    Cyrille Bret, a lecturer at Sciences-Po university in Paris, said that while the West would defend freedom of expression in Russia as well as Navalny's cause, security cooperation with Russia was still needed.  ""We have no choice, Russia has a permanent seat on the UN security council and is invested in several essential formats, the Iranian nuclear agreements, the hypothetical political resolution of the conflict in Syria,"" he said.  A similar approach is likely to be adopted by new US President Joe Biden, whose administration has been sharply critical of Russia over Navalny but also is keen to extend a landmark nuclear arms reduction agreement due to expire next month.  Upcoming votes add an additional factor of uncertainty, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel due to bow out after September polls and Russia facing potentially tense parliamentary elections the same month.  In Moscow, Fyodor Lukyanov, editor in chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs, which is seen as often reflecting Kremlin thinking, said Russia was likely to shrug off new sanctions.  But he added: ""If this pressure continues, it will not work. It will only harden the conviction that the West wants to hinder Russia and that everything must be done to retaliate.""  vl-sjw/js/lc",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

In a statement, the US Navy said the passage ""demonstrates the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""  Tensions in the Taiwan Strait soared to their highest level in years this month after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.  Beijing reacted furiously, staging days of air and sea exercises around Taiwan. Taipei condemned the drills and missile tests as preparation for an invasion.  Taiwan lives under constant threat of an invasion by China, which claims the self-ruled, democratic island as part of its territory to be seized one day -- by force if necessary.  Washington diplomatically recognizes Beijing over Taipei, but maintains de facto relations with Taiwan and supports the island's right to decide its own future.  The US Seventh Fleet said the pair of Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers -- the USS Antietam and the USS Chancellorsville -- conducted the ""routine"" transit on Sunday ""through waters where high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law.""  ""These ships transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State,"" a statement said.   ""It sends a very clear message,"" a White House official, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, said Sunday on CNN. ""The US Navy will sail, fly and operate wherever international law allows it to.""  Kirby, a retired navy rear admiral, said the operation had been ""planned long ago.""  The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) said the United States had ""openly hyped up"" the ships' passage through the strait.  ""The PLA Eastern Theatre Command is following and warning the US vessels throughout their entire journey, and is aware of all movements,"" spokesman Senior Colonel Shi Yi said.  ""Troops in the (eastern) theatre remain on high alert and are prepared at all times to foil any provocations.""  Taiwan's defense ministry confirmed a pair of warships sailed from north to south through the channel.  ""During their southward journey through the Taiwan Strait, the military is fully monitoring relevant movements in our surrounding sea and airspace, and the situation is normal.""    - 'Freedom of navigation' -    The Seventh Fleet is based in Japan and is a core part of the US Navy presence in the Pacific.  The US and Western allies have increased ""freedom of navigation"" crossings by naval vessels of both the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea to reinforce the concept that those seas are international waterways, sparking anger from Beijing.  Washington has said its position on Taiwan remains unchanged and has accused China of threatening peace in the Taiwan Strait and using the visit by Pelosi as a pretext for military exercises.  China's drills included firing multiple ballistic missiles into waters off Taiwan -- some of the world's busiest shipping routes -- which was the first time Beijing has taken such a step since the mid-1990s.  Taiwan staged its own drills, simulating a defense against invasion and displaying its most advanced fighter jet in a rare nighttime demonstration.  Under President Xi Jinping, China's tone on Taiwan has grown more aggressive, with increased military activity and more combative messaging in recent years.  bur-je/mlm/bbk",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109260060']

""Unfortunately, due to the volume of users, it was necessary to deploy our waiting room functionality, which meters access,"" the company said in a statement, referring to ""unprecedented"" interest.  The sudden fixation on the plane carrying Pelosi, dubbed SPAR19, was driven in large part by uncertainty over whether the US House Speaker would go through with the trip she had refused to confirm.  It's significant because Pelosi, second in line to the presidency, is the highest-profile elected US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years and Beijing has made clear that it regards her presence as a major provocation.   Once the plane landed safely on the Taipei tarmac -- speculation had grown that China might take action against the jet -- the mystery was no more and the curious crowd dispersed.  ""Shortly after SPAR19 landed, normal access for all users was restored quickly,"" Flightradar24 said.

Twenty-six people were confirmed dead but at least 170 others remained missing Monday after the glacier broke off a mountainside, triggering a flash flood through a valley in Uttarakhand state.  On Sunday, floodwaters swamped a nearby hydroelectric power complex where Kumar and his colleagues were working 300 metres (nearly 1,000 feet) inside a tunnel.  ""We didn't think we were going to make it,"" the 28-year-old told AFP from his hospital bed.    ""Suddenly there was a sound of whistling... there was shouting, people were telling us to come out. We thought it was a fire. We started running but the water gushed in. It was like a Hollywood movie.""  The men clung to scaffolding rods in the tunnel for four hours, keeping their heads above water and debris, trying to reassure each other.  ""We just kept telling each other -- come what may, we must not let go of the rods. Thank god our hands did not lose their grip,"" said Kumar.  As the flood coursed down the valley, the water started to recede in the tunnel, leaving it filled with more than 1.5 metres of debris and mud.  ""We climbed across the rock debris and forced our way to the mouth of the tunnel,"" said Kumar.  There they found a small opening but they were not sure where it led.   ""All we knew was that we could feel some air.""  Eventually, they saw some light coming through and one of the men got a phone signal and called for help.  There were emotional scenes as Kumar and his colleagues were pulled out of a tiny hole at the surface.   Some punched the air in joy as they saw daylight, some were put straight onto stretchers and carried away. One man put his arms in the air and then fell face-first into the mud.  Despite their hours-long ordeal, they miraculously managed to escape with just minor injuries.    - 'Dust and screams' -    Shopkeeper Ramesh Negi from Raini village was basking in the Sunday morning sun at his home overlooking the plant when he heard a loud roar and saw a huge wall of water smash into and sweep away a bridge that led to the Chinese border.  Dozens of workers building a concrete dam on the Dhouli Ganga river bed and grazers leading their cattle along the mountain slopes disappeared beneath the sudden deluge, leaving behind a wasteland of grey and brown sludge.  ""There was dust and screams all over,"" the 36-year-old Negi told AFP.  ""We tried to alert the grazers but they were blown away by the wind pressure before being consumed by the water and slush. We can only guess what happened.""  Mangra, another tunnel survivor, still can't sleep.  On Sunday, he heard a loud, rumbling sound and the screams of other colleagues: ""Run, run, run!""   The 28-year-old from Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh state scrambled out of the tunnel.   But six of his friends and neighbours from his village remain trapped, and Mangra can't stop thinking and praying for them.  ""The moment the water came close, it felt like the mountain was crashing and the Earth was moving,"" Mangra, who goes by one name, told AFP outside the tunnel, cuts and scrapes on his hands and legs.  ""Once the deluge of water rushed past me, there was dust and fear left behind.""  The glacier broke away as the power complex was in full operation, leaving scores of workers at two power plants missing. About three dozen were feared trapped in the U-shaped tunnel.   Late Monday, giant floodlights lit up a tunnel entrance as teams of rescuers carefully searched through the debris with the help of an excavator for signs of life -- and human remains.

The vote was marred by long lines of people waiting to cast ballots as coronavirus restrictions caused chaos.  Two exit polls showed Arauz had topped the vote with 34.9 to 36.2 percent ahead of Lasso on 21 to 21.7 percent.  To win outright, a candidate needs 50 percent plus one vote or 40 percent and a 10-point lead over the nearest rival.  Arauz, 35, is a protege of former president Rafael Correa, who currently lives in Belgium, where his wife was born, evading a conviction for corruption.  ""Resounding victory in all regions of our beautiful country. Our victory is 2 to 1 ahead of the banker,"" Arauz wrote on Twitter, although he urged supporters to wait for ""official results before celebrating"" his success.  The first results are due to be published on Sunday night.  The vote took place amid a backdrop of economic problems exacerbated by a second, deadly wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has swept Latin America.  Many voters arrived wearing face masks in a nation where the pandemic has claimed 15,000 lives and infected more than 257,000 amongst a 17.4 million population.  The country's 13.1 million voters were choosing a successor to unpopular socialist President Lenin Moreno and the 137 members of the unicameral congress.  Exit polls show indigenous rights campaigner Yaku Perez finishing third with 16.7 to 18 percent in a congested field of 16 candidates, including Ximena Pena, the only woman.  Strict health precautions appeared to slow voting, and may have discouraged some from casting their ballots as long lines stretched outside polling stations.  Election official Enrique Pita told local media that instructions were given by the authorities of the National Electoral Council to relax restrictions ""to allow the lines to advance.""    - End to austerity? -    Arauz represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while businessman Lasso, 65, is from the CREO right-wing movement.  Arauz's mentor Correa, a two-time president, remains a strong political force in the country despite the graft conviction that sank his hopes of campaigning to become his protege's deputy.  Analysts expect the April 11 run-off to pit pro-Correa leftist nationalists against the more diverse anti-Correa factions.  Which way the numerous supporters of leftist Perez, an opponent of Correa's, vote in the runoff will be crucial.  ""Next April 11 the victory will be overwhelming in favor of change,"" said Lasso as he voted in Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil, already anticipating the runoff.  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year, austerity-driven hiatus under Moreno.  Arauz has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.  Running in his third presidential race, free market advocate Lasso has said he would create a million jobs in a year.  He would likely stick to the austerity policies adopted by Moreno, who has had to rein in spending in exchange for International Monetary Fund loans to bolster the oil-producing country's faltering dollar-based economy.    - Under pressure -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno as the price of crude crashed.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, did not seek reelection. His four-year term will end on May 24.  sp-pld/vel/bc/mdl","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76763779', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84078919']"

The incident drew nationwide attention as it occurred only a few days after the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched former president Donald Trump's Florida home, infuriating right-wing circles, although there was no immediate indication the events were linked.  The FBI said Thursday morning that a person armed with a weapon had tried to ""breach"" the entry to the bureau's office in the Ohio city of Cincinnati.  ""Upon the activation of an alarm and a response by armed FBI special agents, the subject fled,"" the FBI said in a statement.  According to local media, the man fired a nail gun and brandished an AR-15-style rifle before fleeing by car.  A police spokesman said the vehicle was pursued by law enforcement and that it stopped in a rural area.  ""Once the vehicle came to a stop, gunfire was exchanged between officers on the scene and the suspect,"" the spokesman said.  Officers then attempted to negotiate with the suspect, but he did not surrender, the spokesman told a press conference after the standoff ended.  After the suspect raised a weapon towards the police, officers shot him and ""he succumbed to his injuries at the scene,"" the spokesperson said.  NBC reported that the suspect, according to three people aiding law enforcement, could be seen in photos of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, but it was unclear whether he went inside.  FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday denounced threats made against the FBI following the raid on Trump's residence, calling them ""deplorable and dangerous.""

The updated fatality count from health authorities in Hamas Islamist run Gaza said six children were among those killed since the start of the ""Israeli aggression"" on Friday, in addition to 204 injured.    But Israel said it has ""irrefutable"" evidence that stray rocket from Islamic Jihad militants was responsible for the death of multiple children in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Saturday.   It was not immediately clear how many children were killed in the incident in Jabalia. An AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at an area hospital, including three minors.    Israel's military has warned its aerial and artillery campaign against Islamic Jihad could last a week, but Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Cairo is talking ""around the clock"" with both sides to ease the violence.    Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, saying the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza.  Civilians meanwhile took refuge in air raid shelters on the Israeli side, with AFP journalists hearing sirens warning of incoming fire in the Tel Aviv area on Saturday evening.  Israel's ongoing strikes are being met with flurries of rockets from the Palestinian side, stoking fears of a repeat of an 11-day conflict that devastated Gaza in May 2021.   Daily life in Gaza has come to a standstill, while the electricity distributor said the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said the next few hours will be ""crucial and difficult"", warning it risked suspending vital services within 72 hours as a result of the lack of electricity.    - 'We are all alone' -    In Gaza City, resident Dounia Ismail said Palestinians have become accustomed to preparing a ""survival bag"" of items such as money and medicine.  ""This latest escalation brings back images of fear, anxiety, and the feeling that we are all alone,"" she told AFP.  On the Israeli side of the frontier, the Magen David Adom emergency service said two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others were lightly hurt while running for safety.  In Kibbutz Nahal Oz, an Israeli community beside the Gaza border, resident Nadav Peretz said he has been ""in the bomb shelter or around it"" since Friday.   ""We recognise that on the other side too there is an uninvolved civilian population, and on both sides children deserve to enjoy their summer vacation,"" the 40-year-old said.    - 'Battle still at beginning' -    An Israeli military spokesman said its forces were ""preparing for the operation to last a week,"" and told AFP that the army is ""not currently holding ceasefire negotiations"".  Islamic Jihad's leader in Gaza, Mohammed al-Hindi, said: ""The battle is still at its beginning.""  Israel and Islamic Jihad confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key commander of the militant group, in a Friday strike.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. Both are blacklisted as terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare-up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that conflict.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.    - Five-year-old girl -    Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza City's main hospital, said medics are facing ""acute shortages of medical supplies"".   The UN humanitarian chief for the occupied Palestinian territories, Lynn Hastings, urged the warring sides to allow ""fuel, food, and medical supplies"" to be delivered to Gaza amid the worsening crisis.  On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl"" was among those killed by Israeli fire.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  The Gaza strikes follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people in the West Bank it said were members of the group.

The company said that it had signed a deal on Friday with its local Russian partner Novatek to sell its 49 percent in the Termokarstovoye gas field ""on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field.""  It said the divestment had been agreed in July and submitted to Russian authorities in early August, with approval coming on August 25.  That was the day after an article appeared in French daily Le Monde reporting the alleged refining of natural gas condensates from Termokarstovoye into jet fuel for fighter-bombers involved in Russia's assault on Ukraine since February.  TotalEnergies -- formerly Total -- owns 49 percent of Terneftegaz, the company that extracts gas from the Termokarstovoye field.  The other 51 percent is held by Novatek, in which the French firm also holds a 19.4 percent stake.  TotalEnergies initially said it had no control over the sales of its Russian partner.  On Friday, it said Novatek had denied that its condensates were being refined into Russian military jet fuel.  Instead, they were sent to processing at a refinery whose products are exclusively exported outside Russia, a Novatek statement relayed by the French firm said.  TotalEnergies also said it was considering legal action in a bid to end an ""unfounded controversy which is damaging the reputation of the company.""  Clara Gonzales at Greenpeace France said that the Termokarstovoye sale must not be a ""smokescreen for the ongoing commercial relations of TotalEnergies in Russia,"" and called for it to offload its stake in Novatek which ""supplies the Russian army"".  ""We are grateful to (French President) Emmanuel Macron and the French people for supporting Ukraine. Against this background, it is a disgrace to France when French companies assist the murder of Ukrainians and the ruining of our cities,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Friday.  ""TotalEnergies, pull out of Russia!""    - 'Exclusively exported' fuel -    Le Monde reported Wednesday that condensates from Termokarstovoye were being sent to a refinery that had provided 42,700 tonnes of fuel from February-July sent to airbases hosting Russian planes.  They accounted for more than eight percent of the raw materials received at the refinery in Omsk since the invasion of Ukraine, it added.  Citing data from financial information firm Refinitiv, the newspaper said the jet fuel shipments could be tracked back to the by-products from Termokarstovoye.  Novatek said via TotalEnergies that all condensates from the gas field are ""delivered to the Ust-Luga processing complex in the Leningrad region.  ""The range of products derived during processing at the Ust-Luga complex includes jet fuel that is exclusively exported outside Russia, and it does not even have the certification to be sold inside the country"".  TotalEnergies is the only major Western energy group to continue its operations in Russia, which accounts for 16.6 percent of its hydrocarbon production and 30 percent of its gas.  Chief executive Patrick Pouyanne had said in March that Russian gas fields exploited by the company's joint ventures ""are going to operate whether I leave or not"" and are vital for supplying energy to Europe.  Selling TotalEnergies' assets at knock-down prices would amount to handing billions to Russian investors, he argued.  But the firm has since announced a partial withdrawal from Russia, including stopping financing the Arctic LNG 2 gas project.  In July, it sold its 20-percent stake in an Arctic oil field to Russia's Zarubejneft.  mdz-adp/tgb/rox/pvh     TOTALENERGIES    NOVATEK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The 76-year-old leader, who took power in 1986, is one of Africa's longest serving presidents, and was accused of crushing the opposition and media ahead of one of the most violent election campaigns in recent years.  Museveni won with 58.6 percent of votes, seeing off a stiff battle from the former ragga singer Bobi Wine, 38, whose turn to politics fired up a youthful population where three quarters are under 30 years old.  Wine was under heavy guard at his home on the outskirts of Kampala as results were announced, with his party saying he was under ""effective house arrest"", while the government said it was merely providing him with security.  The singer-turned-MP was among 10 opposition candidates and came second with 34.8 percent of the votes.

Byabakama urged the population to ""remain calm and accept the outcome of these elections"" while reminding those celebrating to be mindful of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Security forces poured into the streets of Kampala after the announcement, with one soldier atop an armoured personnel carrier urging citizens to maintain social distancing as a helicopter buzzed ahead.  Images on state television showed jubilant Museveni supporters in his home district waving flags and cheering, while soldiers in the capital helped marshall motorcycle drivers for a parade -- handing them yellow vests and Museveni posters.  The election took place after one of the most violent campaigns in years, with harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and the deaths of at least 54 people.  Wine alleged widespread fraud such as ballot box stuffing and said his party agents had in some places been beaten and chased away from polling stations.  ""Whatever is being declared is a complete sham, we reject it and we dissociate ourselves with it,"" he said on Friday.    - 'We don't control them' -    Wine's home remained sealed off by soldiers and police on Saturday, after he told AFP Friday evening that security forces had breached the fence around it and he felt under ""siege"".   The army's deputy spokesman Deo Akiiki said the soldiers were there for ""his own security and the security of people around him"".  However the spokesman for Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), Joel Ssenyonyi told AFP Bobi Wine ""is under effective house arrest"".  ""People are angry because their vote has been stolen. They don't need me or Bobi Wine to tell them to get angry... Even we can't control them.""  ""The election was not fair,"" complained 31-year-old carpenter Dennis Agaba, disappointed at Wine's loss.  However 35-year-old electrician Dennis Tusiime was happy with the result.  ""My grandfather told me about the old regimes,"" he said. ""He is doing his work. I am very, very happy.""  Tibor Nagy, the top US diplomat for Africa, said on Twitter that the vote was ""fundamentally flawed"", citing the denial of accreditation to election observers and ""violence and harassment of opposition figures"".  The internet has been down for four days, and government spokesman Ofwono Opondo said the measure was taken due to ""abuse, misuse, disinformation, fake news with the overall objective of undermining the integrity of the electoral process including the results... and possibly to cause destabilisation"".  He said the internet would be restored once the threat had passed, possibly on Monday morning.    - 35 years of Museveni -    Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote. He is one of Africa's longest serving leaders.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  And for many in the country, where the average age is 16 and most have known only one president, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  Wine, with his humble origins in a slum and popular songs about economic and social injustice, struck a chord with young people, but observers said the odds were stacked against him with Museveni's powerful grip on the state.  His NUP is however on track to see his newly formed NUP become the main opposition party in parliament, notably winning eight of nine constituencies in the capital Kampala.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Bezrukov is among artistic figures who say Moscow should leverage the country's growing isolation to purify Russian culture of Western influence and promote conservative values including patriotism and the Orthodox faith.  ""We must take advantage of the isolation to reconnect with our traditions,"" Bezrukov, one of Russia's most popular artists, told AFP in an interview.  Instead of looking up to Hollywood, Russia should build its own cultural space, he said.  ""For 30 years, we have lived in the Marvel Universe,"" the 48-year-old actor and director said, referring to the American film industry.   ""It's time to create our own,"" Bezrukov said at Moscow's Gubernsky Theatre, where he is artistic director.   ""Returning to the USSR is impossible, but we can try to restore faith in Russia,"" added Bezrukov, who has recently been slapped with EU sanctions for his support of the Kremlin's military campaign in Ukraine.  Over the years President Vladimir Putin has cast himself as a guardian of traditional Russian values such as heterosexual marriage and religion, and repeatedly said that Western liberal values have become obsolete.  Since the start of Moscow's offensive in Ukraine, authorities have redoubled efforts to break with Western values, and many artists say that art should be the main conduit of those attempts.  ""Russia is on the cusp of a conservative revolution,"" said theatre producer and director Eduard Boyakov, who is a supporter of what he calls Russia's ""sacred war"" in Ukraine.    - Blacklisted artists -     After the start of the assault on Ukraine, numerous artists, including director Kirill Serebrennikov and actress Chulpan Khamatova, left Russia.   Those still in the country are under mounting pressure to back the intervention in Ukraine.  Several fiercely pro-Kremlin figures, including Sergei Mironov and Zakhar Prilepin, co-chairmen of the political party A Just Russia, have launched what they dubbed a fight against the ""anti-state position"" of Russia's cultural elites.   They have demanded that the head of the Bolshoi Theatre, Vladimir Urin, sack 30-year-old director Alexander Molochnikov over his allegedly unpatriotic position or be dismissed himself.  Many anti-Kremlin figures can no longer stage performances in Russia.  ""More than a hundred musical performances have been cancelled since February,"" Alexei Kozin, head of Navigator Records, a major Russian music label specialising in rock, told AFP.  Kozin, who is based in Russia, said the unofficial ""blacklist"" currently consists of around 40 names, including Yury Shevchuk, a legendary rock musician who accused the Kremlin of ""killing"" young Russians and Ukrainians during a concert in May.  In June, Moscow authorities announced a change of leadership at three of the capital's top theatres.   The Gogol Centre theatre, transformed by Serebrennikov into a bastion of artistic freedom, has been closed.   ""Authorities no longer want provocative art. They'd rather prefer quiet, reliable, even boring art,"" Gogol Centre playwright Valery Pecheikin, who is still in Russia, told AFP.  ""As a result, the theatre will return to great classics, the cinema to light comedies and museums to exhibitions that spring no surprises,"" he added.    - 'Total clean-up' -     Exhibitions have already been affected, too.  In April, the Tretyakov Gallery pulled the plug on Russian-American artist Grisha Bruskin's show dedicated to ideologies. The gallery cited ""technical reasons"" for the closure of the exhibition initially scheduled to run until July.  Olga Andreeva of conservative weekly Expert evoked ""an eternal struggle"" between Slavophiles and Westernisers, two schools of thought in 19th-century Russia.  ""We are now seeing a new round of this battle,"" she told AFP. ""Society is radically changing.""  Putin himself sets the tone.  In a chilling speech in March, Putin called for the ""self-purification"" of society and said Russians will spit out ""scum and traitors"" who make money in Russia but prefer to live in the West.  In July, he agreed to head a new patriotic movement that is reminiscent of Soviet-era youth organisations.    In late June, Russia unveiled a new 100-ruble note.   In a sign of the times, Apollo, the Greek god of music and poetry that previously featured on the note riding a chariot atop the Bolshoi Theatre, has been replaced with an image of a monument to the Unknown Soldier.  Marina Davydova, editor-in-chief of the magazine Teatr, whose publication has been suspended, compared the pro-Kremlin figures to ""hongweibings"" who helped Mao Zedong crack down on bourgeois tendencies during the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966-1976.  ""It won't be difficult to guess that the clean-up will be total, but the speed with which it is happening is impressive,"" Davydova, who now lives in exile, wrote on Facebook.

The frigid air mass that paralyzed parts of the southern and central United States early in the week claimed some 70 lives, left millions temporarily without power and froze water lines.  ""All of what happened this week was foreseeable and preventable,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" saying it had long been clear that the independent electric grid in Texas was vulnerable to extreme weather.  Turner said Houston, the fourth-largest US city, still needed both plumbing supplies and plumbers, but was making progress in restoring service.   Houston residents have been told to continue boiling water until Monday. Nearby Galveston, on the Gulf of Mexico, ended its boil-water order on Sunday.  Some 31,000 households remained without electricity on Sunday, the poweroutage.us website said, and many Texans were suffering an added insult: monthly electric bills sometimes running as high as $16,000 or more.  While most of the state's utility customers are on fixed-rate plans, some had signed up to variable-rate plans that can save money in fair weather but produce explosive increases in frigid temperatures.  Turner said ""those bills, those exorbitant costs (should be) borne by the state of Texas, and not the individual consumers who did not cause this catastrophe.""  President Joe Biden on Saturday issued a major-disaster declaration for much of the state, providing badly needed financial and administrative aid.  His spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Sunday that Biden hoped to visit Texas ""as early as this week"" if he could do so without interfering with recovery efforts.   Michael McCaul, a Republican congressman from Texas, said the financial impact of the weather crisis could equal that of Hurricane Harvey, a devastating 2017 storm that caused an estimated $125 billion in damages.  He said Biden's emergency declaration could provide funds to help users pay their exorbitant electric bills.   ""That's the current plan, with federal assistance, to be able to help homeowners,"" he said on CNN.  State and local officials have demanded investigations of how the power crisis unfolded so disastrously.  A US senator, Tina Smith, a Democrat of Minnesota, has called for a federal investigation. She said spot prices of natural gas had spiked by up to 100 times normal rates, which utilities had passed on to customers.  bbk/jm    CBS CORPORATION",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

The gun and bomb attack by the Al-Qaeda-linked group on the popular Hayat hotel caused parts of the building to collapse, with many people feared trapped inside since the assault began on Friday evening.  ""The ministry of health has so far confirmed the deaths of 21 people and 117 people wounded,"" 15 of them seriously, Adan said.  Emergency workers and bomb disposal experts made their way through the heavily damaged hotel on Sunday, looking for any explosives and removing rubble as security forces patrolled the area.  Police commissioner Abdi Hassan Mohamed Hijar told reporters on Sunday that ""106 people including children and women"" had been rescued during the siege, which ended around midnight.  As bullets and flames ripped through the hotel, security forces searched the property to bring civilians to safety, including three young children who hid inside a toilet.  ""The casualties mostly happened in the early hours of the attack, after that security forces spent time rescuing people individually and room by room,"" Hijar said.  The attack was the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June, and underscored the challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist group.    - 'Like an earthquake' -    Dozens of people arrived at the hotel premises on Sunday morning, desperate for news of their family members.  ""It is like the devastation after a high-magnitude earthquake... You can only see damaged columns standing in most parts,"" said nurse Sadik Ahmed, who lost his uncle in the attack.  ""My uncle was killed in the reception area; he had gunshot wounds.""   The hotel was a favoured meeting spot for government officials and scores of people were inside when a suicide bomber triggered a massive blast, forcing his way onto the premises along with heavily-armed gunmen.  Minutes later, a second explosion struck as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to help the injured, witnesses said.  Civil servant Abdifatah Mohamed told AFP he had just sat down with a friend and ordered a cappuccino when he heard a deafening explosion, followed by gunfire.   ""The gunmen directly went towards the lobby area in the main building where they were randomly shooting people,"" he said, narrating the harrowing ordeal.  He managed to find shelter near the toilets along with a dozen other people before being rescued 40 minutes later.   Somalia's allies, including the United States, Britain, the European Union and Turkey, as well as the UN, strongly condemned the attack, as did ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  Earlier this month, Washington announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - 'Audacious attack' -    Samira Gaid, executive director of the Hiraal Institute, a Mogadishu-based security think tank, told AFP that the ""audacious attack"" was a message to the new government and its foreign allies.  ""The complex attack is to show that they are still very much present, very relevant and that they can penetrate government security and conduct such attacks.""  The key ""difference between this attack and previous ones is the length of the siege and how long it took for security forces to contain the situation,"" she said.  ""The length of the siege has been very traumatising,"" even for a city that is regularly targeted by Al-Shabaab.  Mohamud said last month that ending the insurgency required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Somalia is also battling a looming famine, with the region's worst drought in 40 years leaving nearly half the country's population of 15 million at risk of starvation.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab said Sunday that the group had killed more than 40 people during the hotel siege.  The jihadists have carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office, and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopian border.  The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, but still control swathes of countryside and retain the ability to launch deadly strikes, often targeting hotels and restaurants.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  nur-ho-amu/jj/har",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Jaylin Keyshawn White admitted to being part of a gang that shot Ryan Fischer as he exercised the three prize pets in Hollywood in February 2021.  At a court hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday, White, now 20, pleaded guilty to second-degree robbery, and received a four-year prison sentence.  Surveillance footage from the scene of the attack shows a car stopping near Fischer and two people jumping out.  One demands that Fischer ""give it up"" before a struggle, in which a gunshot is heard, and the dog walker falls to the ground, screaming.  The attackers each grab one dog -- Koji and Gustav -- and leave Fischer shouting for help.  The third dog -- Miss Asia -- ran back to the dog walker after the robbers drove away.  The robbery led the ""Poker face"" singer to offer a $500,000 reward for the return of the animals, whose theft highlighted a growing trend targeting the valuable breed.  White had been charged in April 2021 along with James Howard Jackson, now 19, and Lafayette Shon Whaley, now 28.  The woman who police said handed in the dogs in response to the reward, has been charged with being an accessory after the fact and with receiving stolen goods.  The alleged gunman, Jackson, was mistakenly released from custody earlier this year after what the US Marshals Service described as a ""clerical error"".  They have offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to his arrest, saying that he should be considered ""armed and dangerous.""  Fischer sustained chest injuries in the attack, and said on Instagram a month later he had suffered a collapsed lung.  Los Angeles police said at the time of the robbery they did not believe the dogs had been targeted because of their owner, but because of the value of the breed on the black market.  Small and friendly -- and thus easy to grab -- French bulldogs do not have large litters.  Their relative scarcity, and their association with stars such as Lady Gaga, Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Jackman, Chrissy Teigen, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Madonna gives them added cache, and means they can change hands for thousands of dollars.  hg/md",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']

Two weeks to the day after Trump supporters violently rampaged at the US Capitol to overturn the election results, Biden took the oath on the same very steps alongside Kamala Harris, who was sworn in moments earlier as the first woman vice president.  Biden, putting his hand on a family Bible, repeated after Chief Justice John Roberts the presidential oath -- that he will ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""  ""It's a new day in America,"" Biden wrote on Twitter before the inauguration as, in a sign of his push for unity, he prayed alongside congressional leaders at a Roman Catholic church.  Biden, who at 78 is the oldest president in US history and only the second Catholic, took office amid enormous challenges with the still-raging Covid-19 pandemic having claimed 400,000 lives in the United States.  Central Washington took on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat of the January 6 attack that left five dead. The Supreme Court reported a bomb threat Wednesday morning.  Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history and the first person of color as the nation's number two.   She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever ""second gentleman"" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who lured the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers in a video that went viral.    - Unprecedented atmosphere -    With the general public essentially barred from attending due to the pandemic, Biden's audience at the National Mall instead was 200,000 flags planted to represent the absent crowds.  ""It's a day a lot of us have been trying to visualize for a long time. We couldn't have guessed that the visual would be quite like this,"" Pete Buttigieg, the former presidential contender tapped by Biden as transportation secretary, told reporters.  Biden nonetheless brought in star power -- absent four years ago with Trump -- as Lady Gaga sang the national anthem and Tom Hanks prepared for a televised evening appearance with the new president.  Biden, who was vice president under Barack Obama and first ran for president in 1987, plans to kick off his tenure with a flurry of 17 orders to turn the page on Trump's divisive reign.  Officials said Biden will immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord and stop the US exit from the World Health Organization and set new paths on immigration, the environment, Covid-19 and the economy.  He will also end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.  Many overseas leaders breathed a sigh of relief at the end of Trump's hawkish, go-it-alone presidency, with Biden's team pledging greater cooperation with the rest of the world.  Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called Biden's inauguration ""a demonstration of the resilience of American democracy,"" as well as ""the resounding proof that, once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House.""    - Trump vows to be back -    For the first time in 152 years, the sitting president did not accompany his successor to the inauguration after Trump for two months falsely alleged that fraud cost him a second term.  Several hours before the inauguration, Trump, 74, and first lady Melania Trump walked a short red carpet on the White House lawn to the Marine One helicopter, which flew near the inauguration-ready Capitol before heading to Andrews Air Force Base on Washington's outskirts.  ""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters in a campaign-style event before flying off for the last time in Air Force One en route to his Florida resort.  ""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.  Trump did not address Biden by name but, in a rare hint of graciousness, wished the next administration ""great luck and great success.""  A spokesman said Trump maintained one tradition by leaving a letter for Biden, although the contents were unknown.  Mike Pence, the outgoing vice president who clashed with Trump in his final days by acknowledging he could not overturn the election, was attending the inauguration alongside former presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and their wives -- including Hillary Clinton, for whom Biden's victory was especially sweet four years after her narrow, surprise defeat to Trump.    - Last-minute Trump pardons -    In one of his last acts before departing the White House, Trump issued scores of pardons to people convicted of crimes or facing charges, including several key allies.  Influential former Trump aide Steve Bannon -- charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall, a flagship Trump policy -- was among 73 people on a list released by the White House.  Trump also at the last minute ended a ban on his administration's officials serving as lobbyists -- an order he had issued with fanfare at the start of his presidency as he vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington.  However, neither Trump nor his relatives enjoyed pardons, amid speculation he could use the legally dubious tactic of a preemptive pardon to fend off future charges.  Trump will still be in focus at the Capitol as the Senate considers convicting him after he was impeached for inciting the mob earlier this month.  The spectacle will clash with the opening days of Biden's tenure, as the new president seeks to swiftly confirm his Cabinet picks and push through ambitious legislation -- including a $1.9 trillion rescue package.  bur-sct/ec",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

""Borrell will go to Moscow in early February to deliver a clear message from the EU,"" a senior diplomat told AFP, despite earlier calls from several member states for the trip to be scrapped.   The visit was confirmed during a meeting in Brussels where foreign ministers from the 27 nations debated their response to the arrest of Kremlin critic Navalny and crackdown on demonstrators.   The diplomats discussed slapping sanctions on the Kremlin after pressure from several capitals for a tough line, but decided it was ""premature"" to impose the punitive measures, one diplomat said.   ""Sanctions are a possible tool, but it is necessary to wait to see what happens in Moscow,"" a second diplomat said.   European diplomats had earlier said Brussels was expected to hold off on sanctions until Navalny goes to court on February 2 to see if the Kremlin puts him behind bars for an extended term.   The anti-corruption campaigner is facing three-and-a-half years in jail for breaching the conditions of an earlier suspended sentence while recovering in Germany from a near-fatal poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent.   His arrest on returning to Russia unleashed a wave of protests on Saturday that saw baton-wielding riot police detain more than 3,500 people.  The EU has called for the immediate release of Navalny and of peaceful protesters detained during the nationwide rallies.   Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis insisted as he entered Monday's meeting that the bloc ""needs to send a very clear and decisive message that this is not acceptable"".  Borrell has insisted on sticking to his planned trip, which would be the first to Moscow by an EU foreign policy chief since 2017, despite opposition from several countries.     Diplomats argued that the Kremlin could use the visit to show the EU is continuing with ""business as normal"" despite the clampdown on the opposition.   Brussels has already hit Russia with sanctions for annexing Crimea and fuelling the Ukraine conflict.   In October, the bloc put six senior Russian officials on an assets freeze and travel ban blacklist over the ""assassination attempt"" on Navalny.   del/dc/bp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105137806']

Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket from Islamic Jihad militants had been responsible for the deaths of multiple children in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Saturday.  It was not immediately clear how many children were killed in the incident in Jabalia. An AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at an area hospital, including three minors.  In Jerusalem AFP reporters heard two explosions as rockets were intercepted in the air.  Al Quds Brigades, the Islamic Jihad movement's military wing, said it had ""fired rockets"" at the city, where air raid sirens wailed.  Jews on Sunday mark the Tisha Be'av remembrance day by visiting the Al Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount, in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem.  Tensions there have previously sparked wider violence, and Hamas's Doha-based chief Ismail Haniyeh has warned against allowing Jews to ""storm"" the compound Sunday, saying it could lead to an ""uncontrollable"" security crisis.      - 'Crucial and difficult' -    The violence is the worst in Gaza since a war last year devastated the impoverished territory -- home to some 2.3 million Palestinians -- and forced countless Israelis to seek shelter from rockets.   Israel's military has warned its latest aerial and artillery campaign against Islamic Jihad could last a week, but Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Cairo was talking ""around the clock"" with both sides to ease the violence.    Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, as the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza.  The head of the army's operations directorate, Oded Basiok, said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"" by Israel's campaign.    That includes Taysir al-Jabari, a top militant commander killed in Gaza City on Friday, and Khaled Mansour, who Islamic Jihad confirmed died in a strike in Rafah, southern Gaza on Saturday.   Israel's Lapid on Sunday called the killing of Mansour a ""remarkable achievement"".  Twenty members of Islamic Jihad were arrested overnight in several raids by Israeli security forces in the West Bank, the army said.  Daily life in the Gaza strip has come to a standstill, while the electricity distributor said the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said the next few hours will be ""crucial and difficult"", warning it risked soon suspending vital services as a result of the lack of electricity.    - 'We are all alone' -    In Gaza City, resident Dounia Ismail said Palestinians had become accustomed to preparing a ""survival bag"" of items such as money and medicine.  ""This latest escalation brings back images of fear, anxiety, and the feeling that we are all alone,"" she told AFP.  Civilians in southern and central Israel, meanwhile, have been forced into air raid shelters since Friday.  The Magen David Adom emergency service said two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others were lightly hurt while running for safety.  In Kibbutz Nahal Oz, an Israeli community beside the Gaza border, resident Nadav Peretz said he had been ""in the bomb shelter or around it"" since Friday.   ""We recognise that on the other side too there is an uninvolved civilian population, and on both sides children deserve to enjoy their summer vacation,"" the 40-year-old said.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. Both are blacklisted as terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare-up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that conflict.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.  bur-pjm/fz",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The explosion occurred as people were offering evening prayers at the mosque, located in a northwest district of Kabul.  Italian non-governmental organization (NGO) Emergency, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said it had received 27 victims of the blast, including three fatalities.  ""We have recorded three fatalities,"" Emergency told AFP via email.  ""Most of the patients we received following the explosion inside a mosque are suffering from shell and burn injuries.""  Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed there were dead and wounded in the blast, but did not specify how many.

On August 11, a suicide bomber blew himself up inside the madrassa of cleric Rahimullah Haqqani, who was killed along with his brother.  The attack was claimed by the jihadist Islamic State group (IS).  Since the Taliban seized power a year ago, there has been significant fall in violence across the country.  However, IS has regularly carried out attacks, primarily targeting minority communities like Shiites, Sufis and Sikhs.  The Taliban say they have defeated the IS, but experts claim the group is a key security challenge for the hardline Islamists.  lsb-qb-jd/st","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113551461', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113550033']"

""We don't care what army you have, we only care about our land. We will fight for it until the end,"" Zelensky says in a video address, on the day which also marks six months since the invasion began.  Since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent in troops on February 24, 2022, Zelensky has led the resistance from Kyiv.  Tensions were high in the capital as both Zelensky and the US State Department warned that Russia could step up attacks around the holiday.

""I hope that concrete steps will be taken to put an end to the war and to avert the risk of a nuclear disaster in Zaporizhzhia,"" he says, referring to the Russian-controlled nuclear plant in southern Ukraine -- Europe's largest -- that has been the target of military strikes, blamed by each side on the other.    - Germany vows continued support -    Chancellor Olaf Scholz assures Kyiv of Germany's support for as long as necessary.

Here's what we know about the disaster so far:  - What happened? -   The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 was en route Saturday from Jakarta to Pontianak city on Borneo island, normally a 90-minute flight, but deviated sharply from its course shortly after take-off and went into a steep dive, according to flight-tracking data and aviation analysts.  Warships, helicopters and divers were deployed in the sea off the mega-city and discovered body parts, wreckage and passenger clothing.   Divers are also looking for the plane's black boxes -- cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- after the authorities said on Sunday they have managed to pinpoint their location.   It is not clear what caused Flight SJ182 to go down near a small archipelago off Jakarta, but analysts have cited such factors as bad weather, pilot error and mechanical malfunction.  A fisherman from Lancang Island, part of the archipelago, told CNN's local affiliate that he heard a noise like an explosion or thunder around the time of the accident. He then saw big waves.  Preliminary data suggested it was ""most likely"" that the plane was intact when it hit the water, according to a senior Indonesian transport safety agency investigator.    - Who was on board? -  The plane was carrying 50 passengers, including 10 children, and 12 crew members.  The captain was Afwan, a 54-year-old veteran aviator who flew for the Indonesian Air Force from 1987 to 1998, according to local media.   Married with three children, he was known as a devout Muslim and well-respected figure in his local community.   The profile of one of his social media accounts was reported to be a picture of Superman praying alongside the words: ""no matter how high you fly, you won't reach heaven if you don't pray five times a day"".  Among the passengers were newlyweds Putri Wahyuni and Ihsan Adhlan Hakim, en route to their wedding celebration.    Rapin Akbar spoke to AFP after giving blood for DNA analysis at a hospital where body bags with human remains were being taken. He said he had five relatives on board, including an older sister, a nephew and his wife and their seven-month-old baby.    - What kind of plane was it? -   It was part of the Boeing 737 Classic series, a popular workhorse aircraft that entered service in 1990. The model used by Sriwijaya Air was configured to carry a maximum of 120 passengers, according to the carrier's website.   The jet was 26 years old and had previously been flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.  ""This (plane) is considered an ageing aircraft and has special added inspections to perform by the airlines to ensure airworthiness,"" said Michael Daniel, a retired US Federal Aviation Administration officer who is now an international aviation consultant.  It was not a variant of Boeing's newer MAX series, which was grounded worldwide after two deadly crashes six months apart, in Indonesia and Ethiopia.    - Does Indonesia have a poor aviation safety record? -   In short, yes. The number of people flying in the world's biggest archipelagic nation of over 17,000 islands has skyrocketed but safety standards have failed to keep pace.  The most serious crash in recent years was the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max accident in 2018, which claimed 189 lives, although that was blamed on the aircraft's faulty anti-stall system.  Others include the 2014 crash of an AirAsia jet with the loss of 162 lives and a year later, the crash of a military plane shortly after take-off, killing 140 people.  But Sriwijaya Air had not previously recorded a fatal crash since starting operations in 2003.   More minor accidents also occur frequently in a country where conditions for pilots can be challenging, ranging from poorly-maintained runways to mountainous terrain and sudden tropical downpours.  One of the more unusual air accidents in Indonesia happened in 2013 when a passenger jet crashed into a cow and skidded off the runway as it came into land at a small airport on Sulawesi island.   The only casualty was the cow, crushed to death under the Lion Air plane's wheels.   bur-sr/pb/am   BOEING    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

""Moussa Faki Mahamat strongly condemns the continued air strike attacks by Israel on Gaza that have killed more than 30 Palestinian civilians, including 6 children,"" an AU statement said.  The ""targeting of civilians and the continued illegal occupation by Israeli security forces of the Occupied Territories, are in stark violation of international law, and complicate the search for a just and lasting solution"", the statement said.  The recent fighting is the worst in Gaza since a war last year devastated the impoverished coastal territory, home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, and forced Israelis to seek shelter from rockets.  Israel has stepped up its bombardments of positions of Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed group designated as a terrorist organisation by several Western nations, and the militants have fired over 500 rockets in return.   The relationship with Israel is a rare point of contention for the AU, a body that values consensus, with powerful member states, notably South Africa, loudly protesting a decision by Faki last year to accept Israel's accreditation to the bloc as an observer.  The decision was a major diplomatic win for Israel, but opposing member nations said it contradicted numerous AU statements -- including from Faki himself -- backing the Palestinian Territories.  In its statement on Sunday, the AU reiterated its support for ""the Palestinian people in their legitimate quest for an independent and sovereign State"" with East Jerusalem as its capital.  str-amu/spm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Voting in Kampala took place under heavy military and police presence, with no reports of violent incidents making their way through the communications shutdown.  Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, having ruled for almost four decades, against singer-turned-MP Bobi Wine, 38, whose popularity among a youthful population has rattled the former rebel leader.  After a campaign marred by arrests, bloodshed and harassment of the opposition and journalists, the internet was shut down on the eve of the election, further fuelling fears the vote would not be free and fair.  After polling closed, election agents in the Kololo neighbourhood of Kampala opened ballot boxes onto a black tarpaulin and counted each vote aloud as tallying began.  Wine said several of his party's polling agents had been arrested during the morning, as he cast his vote on the outskirts of Kampala alongside his wife before a crowd of dancing and singing supporters.  Police spokesman Fred Enanga told AFP said: ""The whole polling exercise has been largely peaceful throughout the country so far. No major cases of violence reported.""  Soldiers marched in Kamwokya, the crowded Kampala slum where Wine grew up and is hugely popular, while convoys of riot police patrolled the capital.  Museveni voted in his home district of Kiruhura in rural western Uganda, about 250 kilometres (155 miles) from the capital.   ""He is sure of winning, but he will accept the result of the election so long as they are free and fair,"" Don Wanyama, the presidential spokesman, told AFP.  - Delayed voting -  Wine is the strongest of 10 opposition contenders. But Museveni has never lost an election, and most observers expect he and his ruling National Resistance Movement will emerge victorious.  Nevertheless optimism was high in the opposition heartland of Kamwokya.  ""I am here to change the leadership of this nation because for years, they've been telling me they will secure my future. They have not done that,"" said driver Joseph Nsuduga, 30.  Some 18 million voters were registered for the presidential and parliamentary vote. Results are expected by Saturday.  ""I continue to encourage all Ugandans to turn out and vote,"" Wine said.  Voting was delayed in several locations in Kampala and queues snaked for hours, with Wine complaining of problems with the biometric machines used to confirm voter identities.  The opposition frontrunner has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.  - Generation gap -    Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  He has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  But he is still held in high regard by older Ugandans who remember the relative stability and security that Museveni returned to the country.  ""These young people, they want change, but they don't know what Museveni did for us,"" said Faith Florence Nakalembe, 58.  But her children, also standing in line in Kamwokya to vote, desperately want change.  ""For 23 years I have never seen a different president, and I want someone else,"" said her son, 23-year-old student Saad Mukoone, who was throwing his vote behind Wine.  ""Most of the people in government are old, and they don't want to leave.""  - Crackdown -    The runup to polling day was marred by a sustained crackdown on Museveni's rivals and government critics, and unprecedented attacks on the nation's media and human rights defenders.  In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces loyal to Museveni during protests against one of Wine's numerous arrests.  The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  On Tuesday, Museveni announced the suspension of social media networks and messaging services like Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp in response to Facebook closing accounts linked to government officials the tech giant said were spreading misinformation.  str-np-fb/ri   FACEBOOK    Twitter","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

The head of the presidential coalition said her side won 30 of the 46 departments in the West African country and overseas constituencies.  ""This undoubtedly gives us a majority in the National Assembly,"" Aminata Toure told reporters late Sunday.  ""We have given a majority in the National Assembly to our coalition president"" Sall, she added, without giving the number of seats won by her camp or whether it was an absolute or relative majority.  Toure however acknowledged her coalition had been defeated in the capital, Dakar.  But on Monday the main opposition coalition expressed ""astonishment"" at Toure's remarks, claiming it had won a ""comfortable majority"" and that the presidential camp was ""looking to once again confiscate the vote"".  It also failed to specify the number of seats or what kind of majority it was claiming.  ""We call on national and international opinion to act as witnesses against any attempt to manipulate the results,"" the opposition said in a statement.  The opposition had hoped the elections would impose a cohabitation, or divided government, on Sall and curb any ambitions he may have for a third term.  Sunday's polls were an important test for Sall after local elections in January saw the opposition win in major cities, including Dakar, Ziguinchor in the south and Thies in the west.  Initial indications were that the poll was close and the main opposition coalition gained ground, particularly in urban areas, according to local media.    - Opposition collaboration -    The single round of voting will decide the 165 seats of the single-chamber parliament -- currently controlled by the president's supporters -- for the next five years.  Sall has promised to appoint a prime minister -- a position he abolished and then restored in December 2021 -- from the winning camp.  Some seven million Senegalese were eligible to vote in the election, which passed without any major incidents.  Turnout at several polling stations appeared relatively low, according to AFP correspondents and observers, and the interior ministry said the participation rate was 47 percent.  Provisional overall results are expected no later than Friday, but local media and the main political parties have been counting some of the results since Sunday evening.  Opposition coalition Wallu Senegal (""Save Senegal"" in Wolof) said Sall had failed to obtain a majority and that prominent politicians including former prime minister Toure had been beaten.  Yahya Sall, a retired soldier, said he hoped the new parliament ""will have a strong opposition presence... to advance democracy"".  Lawmakers are elected according to a system that combines proportional representation, with national lists for 53 lawmakers, and majority voting in the country's departments for 97 others.  The diaspora elects the remaining 15 members of parliament.  This year, eight coalitions are in the running, including Yewwi Askan Wi (""Liberate the People"" in Wolof), the main opposition coalition headed by former presidential candidate Ousmane Sonko, who came third in the 2019 presidential election.  Ahead of the poll, Yewwi Askan Wi joined forces with Wallu Senegal, led by former president Abdoulaye Wade.  The two groups agreed to work together to obtain a parliamentary majority and ""force governmental cohabitation"".    - Rising prices -    The vote took place against a backdrop of rising prices, partly because of the Ukraine war.  The opposition has questioned the priorities of the government, which has highlighted its subsidies for oil products and food as well as infrastructure building.   Sall, 60, was elected in 2012 for seven years then re-elected in 2019 for another five. He has been accused of wanting to break the two-term limit and run again in 2024.  He has remained vague on the subject, but any defeat of his supporters in Sunday's vote could upset such plans.  The 21-day election campaign passed in a mostly calm atmosphere.  The pre-campaign period, however, was marked by violent demonstrations that left at least three people dead after several members of the main opposition coalition, including Sonko, were banned from taking part.  On June 29, the opposition eased tensions by agreeing to take part in the elections, which it had threatened to boycott.  mrb-amt/cl/imm/raz",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84036241']

Known best for Emmy-winning television movie ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" and her Academy-nominated turn in 1972 film ""Sounder,"" Tyson's acting career spanned seven decades and often tackled issues of racism and social justice.  She frequently turned down roles she saw as reinforcing negative Black stereotypes, including maids and prostitutes, and was seen as recently as last year on the small-screen thriller ""How to Get Away with Murder.""  ""With heavy heart, the family of Miss Cicely Tyson announces her peaceful transition this afternoon,"" manager Larry Thompson said in a statement to AFP.  ""I have managed Miss Tyson's career for over 40 years, and each year was a privilege and blessing,"" Thompson wrote, without further details of the cause of death.  Tyson's highly decorated career included multiple Emmys and a Tony in 2013 for ""A Trip to Bountiful.""  Beside Depression-era drama adaptation ""Sounder,"" her other film credits include ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" and ""The Help"".  In 2018, at the age of 93, Tyson was granted an honorary Oscar for her life-long work as an icon for two generations of African American actresses.  ""She's a queen to us, Afro-Americans,"" the actor and producer Tyler Perry said at the glitzy Hollywood ceremony.  ""She had to work ten times harder to be paid a hundred times less"" because she was a black woman, Perry said.  The composer Quincy Jones, in an emotional tribute, said Tyson ""opened the door"" for Black actresses from Angela Bassett to Lupita Nyong'o.  Born in New York's Harlem to Caribbean immigrant parents, Tyson began her career as a model before turning to acting.  She won Emmys for ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,"" in which she played a 110-year-old woman in the Civil Rights Era reflecting on a life dating back to slavery times, and for ""Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All.""   She played other legendary Black female historical figures, including Harriet Tubman and Coretta Scott King, the activist wife of Martin Luther King, Jr.   ""Trailblazer is not a sufficient description. What a legendary artist, sage and matriarch. We salute her. Rest in power, Lady Cicely,"" tweeted the Martin Luther King Jr Center on Thursday.

Henry Reese, president of non-profit group City of Asylum, was also injured when an assailant stormed a literary event stage Friday and stabbed Rushdie in the neck and abdomen; he said it took several moments to grasp what was taking place.  ""It was very difficult to understand. It looked like a sort of bad prank and it didn't have any sense of reality,"" Reese, 73, told CNN.  ""Then when there was blood behind him, it became real.""

More than 3,500 demonstrators were detained in protests across the country on Saturday, with several injured in clashes with police in Moscow, following Navalny's call to rally against President Vladimir Putin's 20-year rule.  The West has widely condemned the ""harsh tactics"" used against demonstrators, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian saying Sunday the mass arrest of protesters was ""an intolerable affront"" and a ""slide towards authoritarianism"".  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said the bloc would discuss ""next steps"" on Monday.  Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday accused the US embassy of interfering in Russia's domestic affairs after the mission distributed a ""demonstration alert"" to US citizens in Russia recommending they avoid protests.  ""Of course, these publications are inappropriate,"" Peskov told a state TV channel. ""And of course indirectly, they are absolutely an interference in our domestic affairs.""  A US mission spokeswoman said US embassies and consulates around the world routinely issue safety messages to US citizens.  ""This is a common, routine practice of many countries' diplomatic missions,"" she told AFP on Sunday.  The US embassy in Moscow on Saturday said that Washington supported ""the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression"".    - Protests in over 100 cities -    Peskov also accused protest organisers of seeking to ""rock the boat"" and said the number of people who had demonstrated paled in comparison to Putin supporters.  ""A lot of people vote for Putin,"" Peskov said, pointing to last year's constitutional plebiscite that allowed 68-year-old Putin to remain in power until 2036.  Navalny, Putin's most prominent critic, was arrested on returning to Moscow last weekend following months of treatment in Germany for a near-fatal poisoning with a Soviet-designed Novichok nerve agent.  He then called for Saturday's unauthorised protests, which took on an unprecedented geographic scale, spanning more than 100 cities.   Around 20,000 people protested in Moscow and more than 10,000 in Saint Petersburg, according to estimates from AFP journalists, with rallies also held in numerous countries including France and Lithuania.  Leonid Volkov, the head of Navalny's regional network, praised the turnout.  ""I am certainly proud, very impressed and inspired,"" Volkov told AFP. Navalny's team is hoping to stage another rally next weekend.  Many at the protests said they were angered by the findings of a Navalny investigation into an opulent Black Sea property allegedly owned by Putin.   The two-hour report, which claims that Putin owns ""the world's most expensive palace"" allegedly financed through a massive corruption scheme, has been viewed nearly 80 million times on YouTube.   Peskov said the luxury mansion on the Black Sea was ""private"" property and had nothing to do with Putin.    - Protester in intensive care -    Moscow officials said that 29 people received medical assistance in hospitals and were released.   Saint Petersburg prosecutors said they were probing violations on ""the part of law enforcement"" and the use of force against a woman.  The statement was released after local media published a video showing a middle-aged woman falling to the ground after being kicked by riot police.  In the video, a woman -- identified as Margarita Yudina -- is seen asking three policemen in full riot gear why they were detaining a young unarmed protester. One of the policeman then kicks her in the stomach.  Yudina was hospitalised in a ""serious condition"" with a head injury before being released on Sunday evening, local health committee spokeswoman Olga Riabinina told AFP.  The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it had launched criminal inquiries in Moscow over the use of violence against law enforcement, hooliganism and property damage.  In a separate statement, investigators said a 36-year-old man was detained after hitting two policemen at the Saint Petersburg protest.  The OVD Info monitor said police seized at least 3,521 protesters, with 1,398 people detained in Moscow and 526 in Saint Petersburg.  The head of the Kremlin's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, said most of those detained in Moscow had been released.  He also defended the detentions, saying the protests were illegal and took place during a coronavirus pandemic. ""I see no violations whatsoever,"" he said.   Navalny, who rose to prominence a decade ago, accuses the FSB security agency of seeking to poison him on Putin's orders.   He is the target of several criminal probes and supporters fear authorities are planning to sentence him to a long prison term.  mak-as/dl/har   GOOGLE","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105008734', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105137806']"

The vote was marred by long lines of people waiting to cast ballots as coronavirus restrictions caused chaos.  Two exit polls showed Arauz had topped the vote with 34.9 to 36.2 percent ahead of Lasso on 21 to 21.7 percent.  To win outright, a candidate needs 50 percent plus one vote or 40 percent and a 10-point lead over the nearest rival.  Arauz, 35, is a protege of former president Rafael Correa, who currently lives in Belgium, where his wife was born, evading a conviction for corruption.  ""Resounding victory in all regions of our beautiful country. Our victory is 2 to 1 ahead of the banker,"" Arauz wrote on Twitter, although he urged supporters to wait for ""official results before celebrating"" his success.  The first results are due to be published on Sunday night.  The vote took place amid a backdrop of economic problems exacerbated by a second, deadly wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has swept Latin America.  Many voters arrived wearing face masks in a nation where the pandemic has claimed 15,000 lives and infected more than 257,000.  The country's 13.1 million voters were choosing a successor to unpopular socialist President Lenin Moreno and the 137 members of the unicameral congress.  Exit polls show indigenous rights campaigner Yaku Perez finishing third with 16.7 to 18 percent in a congested field of 16 candidates, including Ximena Pena, the only woman.  Strict health precautions appeared to slow voting, and may have discouraged some from casting their ballots as long lines stretched outside polling stations.  Election official Enrique Pita told local media that instructions were given by the authorities of the National Electoral Council to relax restrictions ""to allow the lines to advance.""    - End to austerity? -    Arauz represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while businessman Lasso, 65, is from the CREO right-wing movement.  Arauz's mentor Correa, a two-time president, remains a strong political force in the country despite the graft conviction that sank his hopes of campaigning to become his protege's deputy.  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year, austerity-driven hiatus under Moreno.  Arauz has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.  Running in his third presidential race, free market advocate Lasso has said he would create a million jobs in a year.  He would likely stick to the austerity policies adopted by Moreno, who has had to rein in spending in exchange for International Monetary Fund loans to bolster the oil-producing country's faltering dollar-based economy.    - Second round? -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno as the price of crude crashed.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, did not seek reelection.

The United States saw 900,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, a massive number that remains well above the single worst week of the 2008-2010 global financial crisis, during which Biden served as vice president under Barack Obama.  Economists had been expecting a sharper drop in seasonally adjusted claims in the week ended January 16, but instead they fell just 26,000 from the prior week, underscoring the toll taken by the renewed onslaught of Covid-19 in the United States.  The government also reported 423,734 new filings made under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for self-employed people not normally eligible for benefits.  That was nearly double the week prior after that program lapsed briefly amid a standoff in Washington over extending it and other aid.  All told, nearly 16 million people were receiving some form of aid from the government as of January 2 -- a figure that's expected to rise.  ""Layoffs are ongoing at an elevated pace, reflecting the impact of containment measures,"" Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said in an analysis.  ""Conditions are unlikely to improve until infections can be curbed, and the economy can reopen more completely.""    - Turning it around -    New jobless filings skyrocketed after states and cities restricted business across the country when Covid-19 broke out in March, and though they've come down from the millions initially reported each week as businesses shed employees en masse, they remain at very high levels.  The unemployment rate has seen a similar trajectory, shooting up to 14.7 percent in April but declining in subsequent months to its current 6.7 percent.  Biden, who took office on Wednesday, has proposed a $1.9 trillion spending measure aimed both at revitalizing the economy and improving the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.  However Lydia Boussour of Oxford Economics warned the country is in for rough times to come.  ""Fiscal stimulus prospects, along with broader vaccine diffusion, are pointing to a brightening labor market outlook but with the pandemic still raging, claims are poised to remain elevated in the near-term,"" she said.  With his Democrats only narrowly controlling both houses of Congress, it's unclear what degree of support Biden's package will get from Republicans.  Michael Feroli of JP Morgan predicted Congress could pare the president's plan down to the $900 billion range, matching a separate measure approved last month.   Even the smaller amount would boost GDP growth this year to 5.3 percent and in 2022 to 2.6 percent, he said, a ""remarkable expected turnaround"" aided also by negligible inflation and the Federal Reserve's maintenance of low borrowing rates.  Sectors of the economy have nonetheless prospered during the pandemic, with the Commerce Department reporting on Thursday homebuilding projects jumped 5.8 percent in December from the month prior.  That was 12 percent higher than December 2019, despite the toll of Covid-19.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The 76-year-old leader, who took power in 1986, is one of Africa's longest serving presidents. He was accused of crushing the opposition and media ahead of one of the most violent election campaigns in recent years.  Museveni won with 58.6 percent of the vote, seeing off a stiff battle from 38-year-old former ragga singer Bobi Wine, whose turn to politics fired up a youthful population where three quarters are under 30 years old.  Wine was under heavy guard at his home on the outskirts of Kampala as the results were announced, with his party saying he was under ""effective house arrest"". The government said it was merely providing him with security.  The singer-turned-MP was among 10 opposition candidates and came second with 34.8 percent of the vote.  ""The electoral commission declares Yoweri Museveni... elected President of the republic of Uganda,"" said election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama.  He said turnout was 57.22 of almost 18 million registered voters.  Security forces poured into the streets of Kampala after the announcement, with one soldier atop an armoured personnel carrier urging citizens to maintain social distancing as a helicopter buzzed overhead.  Images on state television showed jubilant Museveni supporters in his home district waving flags and cheering, while soldiers in the capital helped marshall motorcycle drivers for a parade -- handing them yellow vests and Museveni posters.  Museveni, in a wide-ranging speech on state television after the announcement, thanked his supporters and said that now, ""the only thing to avoid is violence"".  ""I think this might turn out to be the most cheating-free election since 1962,"" when the country achieved independence, he said.  However, the election was marked by harassment and arrests of the opposition, attacks on the media and the deaths of at least 54 people.  Wine alleged widespread fraud such as ballot box stuffing and said his party agents had in some places been beaten and chased away from polling stations.  ""Whatever is being declared is a complete sham, we reject it and we dissociate ourselves with it,"" he said on Friday.    - 'We don't control them' -    Wine's home remained sealed off by soldiers and police on Saturday, after he told AFP Friday evening that security forces had breached the fence around it and he felt under ""siege"".   The army's deputy spokesman Deo Akiiki said the soldiers were there for ""his own security and the security of people around him"".  However, the spokesman for Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), Joel Ssenyonyi, told AFP Bobi Wine ""is under effective house arrest"".  ""People are angry because their vote has been stolen. They don't need me or Bobi Wine to tell them to get angry,"" Ssenyonyi said. ""Even we can't control them.""  Disappointed at Wine's loss, 31-year-old carpenter Dennis Agaba complained that ""the election was not fair"".  However, 35-year-old electrician Dennis Tusiime was celebrating the result.  ""My grandfather told me about the old regimes,"" Tusiime said. ""I am very, very happy.""  Tibor Nagy, the top US diplomat for Africa, said on Twitter that the vote was ""fundamentally flawed"", citing the denial of accreditation to election observers and ""violence and harassment of opposition figures"".  The internet has been down for four days, and government spokesman Ofwono Opondo said the measure was taken due to ""abuse, misuse, disinformation, fake news with the overall objective of undermining the integrity of the electoral process including the results... and possibly to cause destabilisation"".  He said the internet would be restored once the threat had passed, possibly on Monday morning.    - Odds stacked against Wine -    Museveni has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.   Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  For many in the country, where the average age is 16 and most have known only one president, Museveni's glory days are no longer relevant or sufficient.  Wine, with his humble origins in a slum and popular songs about economic and social injustice, struck a chord with young people. But observers said the odds were stacked against him with Museveni's powerful grip on the state.  Wine's newly-formed NUP is however on track to become the main opposition party in parliament, notably winning eight of nine constituencies in the capital Kampala.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Alex Jones, founder of the website InfoWars and host of a popular radio show, has been found liable in multiple defamation lawsuits brought by parents of the victims of the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.  The 48-year-old Jones claimed for years on his show that the Sandy Hook shooting was ""staged"" by gun control activists and the parents were ""crisis actors,"" but has since acknowledged it was ""100 percent real.""  A 12-person jury in Austin, Texas, heard closing arguments on Tuesday in the first of the multiple defamation cases against Jones to reach the damages phase.  The case was brought by Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, the parents of six-year-old Jesse Lewis, who was among the children slain by a 20-year-old gunman in the worst-ever school shooting in the United States.  Heslin and Lewis delivered emotional testimony about the impact of Jones' false claims on their lives, including harassment, online abuse and death threats.  They are seeking compensatory damages of at least $150 million from Jones, an ally and supporter of former president Donald Trump, who appeared frequently on his radio show during his 2016 presidential campaign.  ""We're here to make sure Alex Jones and his company pays for the reckless lies that they told,"" Kyle Farrar, an attorney for the parents, said in his closing argument.

Islamic State group fighters captured a third of Iraq in a lightning offensive in 2014, seizing the northern city of Mosul as their stronghold and vandalising or destroying a swathe of cultural sites across the country.  Now, using thousands of photographs, a group of local engineers have given a virtual rebirth to five historic sites in Mosul and the broader Nineveh province, including a mosque and its leaning minaret.  ""It takes you to another world,"" said Mahiya Youssef, pulling the VR goggles off her rose-covered hijab at the Mosul Heritage House museum, after exploring the 3D images of damaged buildings.  ""I really wish it was the real Mosul, not just a virtual version"", added Youssef, 50, who works in a food factory in the northern city. ""The return to reality is painful.""  The IS group's then chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his only confirmed public appearance at Mosul's Al-Nuri mosque, where he declared the establishment of a ""caliphate"".  Mosul's Old City was reduced to rubble during the battle to retake the city, including the mosque and its adjacent leaning minaret, nicknamed Al-Hadba or the ""hunchback"".  Iraqi authorities have accused IS of planting explosives at the site before their withdrawal. Only the minaret's base survived.    - 'Retrieve memories' -    VR technology has been used before to recreate the heritage destroyed by the IS group, including a UNESCO-backed exhibit in the United States.  But this museum brings sites back to life for the people who live in Mosul.  ""Many children have never seen the Al-Nuri mosque and its Al-Hadba minaret,"" 29-year-old Ayoub Younes, the museum's founder.  ""We try, through virtual reality, to let the person experience visiting those sites and retrieve those memories.""  Five years after Iraqi forces and an international coalition routed the jihadists in mid-2017, historic sites, mosques and churches in Mosul are still being restored.  But large parts of the Old City remain oceans of debris.  While some residents have returned to other districts, much of the city remains a patchwork of buildings either ruined or under construction.   The private museum with a marble facade, sitting along the Tigris river, opened in mid-June and saw more than 4,000 visitors in its first month, Younes said.   In a sombre room, curious visitors wait to use the museum's sole VR headset, a pair of large black googles.  Other sites on the virtual visit are the historic Al-Tahera church, tucked among the once meandering alleyways of the Old City, and the more than 2,000 year old Hatra archaeological site in the desert south of Mosul.  The jihadists took guns and pickaxes to the once extensive remains of the ancient city, releasing video footage in 2015 of their orgy of destruction.     - 'Saving the memory' -     On his computer screen, Abdullah Bashir showed a 3D replica of the mosque housing the Nabi Yunus shrine -- revered by both Muslims and Christians as the tomb of Prophet Jonah -- which the extremists blew up in 2014.  ""We used personal photos and shots taken by residents"" to reconstruct the sites in their former state, he said.  But he said there were ""very few"" images before 2014, citing the ""lack of photos"" as the main difficulty.  Bashir and other specialised engineers from QAF Lab have brought the former scenes back to life, in a project he says is ""a way of saving the memory of Mosul"".  After his virtual tour, visitor Mohammed Abdullah pushed his wheelchair around the real-life displays in museum's vaulted rooms.  Many of the exhibits are daily-life objects donated by local families, from terracotta amphoras to oil lamps, traditional wall hangings, metal containers and even an old radio.  Abdullah, 28, a student of telecommunication engineering, also said the contrast between the VR and the reality of Mosul was painful.  ""Reconstruction is extremely slow, and is not equal to the devastation,"" said Abdullah.  He called for faster restoration of heritage sites both to attract tourists and to ""breathe life"" into nearby areas.   Despite the bitter taste the virtual visit left, he said he has not lost hope.   ""The day will come when we will make this visit in reality,"" he said. ""It will be even better than the virtual one"".  str-lk/tgg/gde/lg/pjm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113646367']

Dismissal emails went out to 23 percent of workers, referred to internally as ""Robinhoodies,"" in a cost-cutting move that the Silicon Valley-based company said will leave it with about 2,600 employees.  Internet giants whose business boomed during the pandemic have taken a hit from inflation, the war in Ukraine, supply-line trouble and people returning to pre-Covid lifestyles.  Robinhood earlier this year cut nine percent of its staff, but that wasn't enough, chief executive Vlad Tenev said in a blog post.  ""Since that time, we have seen additional deterioration of the macro environment, with inflation at 40-year highs accompanied by a broad crypto market crash,"" Tenev said.  ""This has further reduced customer trading activity and assets under custody.""  Meanwhile, financial services regulators in the state of New York on Tuesday announced that Robinhood's cryptocurrency unit will pay a $30 million penalty for failing to meet mandatory standards for cyber-security and fighting money laundering.  The failure ""resulted in significant violations"" of state regulations, said state superintendent of financial services Adrienne Harris.  Flaws at Robinhood Crypto meanwhile stemmed from ""significant shortcomings"" in management that included failure to foster ""an adequate culture of compliance"" with banking rules, regulators said.  Robinhood associate general counsel Cheryl Crumpton said the company is ""pleased"" the matter is resolved in a settlement.  ""We have made significant progress building industry-leading legal, compliance, and cybersecurity programs, and will continue to prioritize this work to best serve our customers,"" Crumpton said in response to an AFP inquiry.  Robinhood layoffs will be concentrated in operations, marketing, and program management, Tenev said.

The extreme winter weather system wreaked havoc across much of the southern and central United States this week, reportedly killing at least 40 people and igniting anger in Texas as authorities scrambled to turn the lights back on.   Houston resident Percy McGee rated his frustration level at ""number 10"" as he waited his turn at the city's Delmar Stadium, now a mass bottled water distribution site.  ""I've been up since five o'clock. And I've been on the road since six. And I know it's 11:30 but I'm gonna sit here until, I mean, I have no choice. All the stores in my area are out of water,"" he told AFP.  ""I'm very frustrated. I'm a diabetic. I have a 94-year-old senior as a diabetic. We haven't had no medicine. Nothing... So I'm really frustrated mentally. But I'm keeping it together,"" he said.  Erica Granado, another Houston resident, said she had rushed to the site after seeing it on the news.   ""I gotta be early because I knew everybody -- yeah, everybody wants water and so it's a difficult time for everybody,"" she said, adding: ""Thank God I had gas in my car.""  On Friday the weather system was slowly moving northeast, where hardy New Englanders -- far more used to scouring winter storms than residents of the Lone Star state -- were battening down.  But even as the temperature rose above freezing in Texas -- and the National Weather Service forecast weekend weather in the 50s Fahrenheit (10-15 Celsius) -- state governor Greg Abbott said some 165,000 people were still without power Friday.  Water pressure problems meant nearly seven million Texans were being advised to boil their water before drinking it or using for cooking, said Toby Baker, who heads the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, adding that nearly 264,000 people were impacted by non-operational water systems.  Some residents were facing the misery of burst pipes and flooding.  ""It was like a waterfall was coming down and it was starting to come out of the bathroom and to the other rooms,"" said Birgit Kamps of Houston, adding that a neighbor helped switch off the water at the break -- halting the flood, but leaving her without running water.    - Texans isolated -    Texas power companies implemented rolling blackouts in recent days to avoid grids being overloaded as residents cranked up the heat during the cold snap.  The state is the only one in the continental US to have its own independent power grid, meaning it was cut off when the weather hit.  The blackouts also shut down a major computer chip manufacturer, NXP Semiconductors in Austin, at a time when a worsening shortage of semiconductors is already affecting a variety of sectors including automobiles, mobile phones, game consoles and more.  Authorities opened hundreds of ""warming centers"" across the state. One furniture store in Houston also threw open its doors to freezing residents.   ""We had a thousand people coming here trying our warming stations and getting free hot meals,"" James McIngvale, owner of the Gallery Furniture store, told AFP.  President Joe Biden spoke with Bob Fenton, acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is already on the ground in Texas, and said he was ready to mobilize other federal agencies, according to a White House statement Friday.  Biden also planned to sign a major disaster declaration in the state, the White House said. On Thursday he told Abbott the government would work ""hand-in-hand"" with state authorities to offer relief.  The president has also ordered federal authorities to coordinate disaster relief in Oklahoma and Louisiana, which declared emergencies after they were also hit by the extreme weather.   The cold stretched as far as Seattle, in the northwestern US state of Oregon, where a 90-year-old woman trudged six miles (10 kilometers) in a foot of snow with two walking sticks to get her first vaccination against Covid-19, after frantically calling around to get a shot.   The harsh weather had made driving to Fran Goldman's hospital appointment too dangerous.  bur-st/acb   PFIZER",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Voters in upstate New York are choosing a candidate to serve the final months of Democrat Antonio Delgado's term in the House of Representatives, after he quit to become the Empire State's lieutenant governor.  The battle for New York's 19th Congressional -- a swing district wedged between New York City and state capital Albany -- comes two months after the Supreme Court sparked nationwide protests by ending the federally-guaranteed right to abortion.  Democrat Pat Ryan has sought to turn the vote -- the last US special election before November -- into a referendum on abortion access.  He has accused Republican Marc Molinaro and his party, who are against such access, of being ""too extreme on women's rights.""  ""Choice is the ballot, but we won't go back. Freedom is under attack, but it's ours to defend. Our democracy is fragile, but we will fight for it,"" Ryan said in a statement on the eve of the ballot.  Molinaro has also followed his party's main political talking points, including on inflation, highlighting spiralling living costs in a campaign that has seen millions of dollars funneled on advertising.  ""We can send a message that enough is enough, that we care deeply about one another, that we are willing to work hard to solve the problems that face us, and that together we can overcome anything,"" he said in his own election eve message.  President Joe Biden carried the district by fewer than two points in 2020, after Donald Trump took it by about seven points in 2016. Barack Obama won there in 2012.  Both candidates will be back on the ballot in November, but in different districts newly drawn in the latest round of redistricting.   The somewhat anachronistic system means Ryan -- who has yet to be nominated to fight for a seat in the midterms -- is on the ballot Tuesday in two districts for two separate seats for two different congresses.  New York is also holding several nominating contests -- known as primary elections -- including a vote pitting Democratic committee chairs Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney against one another.  In Florida, Democrats pick their candidate to challenge Governor Ron DeSantis in November.

To reach it they must pass through a gate remotely controlled by Israeli security forces.  Since Israel seized the territory in the Six-Day War of 1967, a Jewish settlement has sprung up on surrounding land claimed by the family leaving them isolated in their single-storey house on the edge of the Palestinian village of Beit Ijza.  ""I don't know when this will end,"" sighed Sa'adat Gharib. ""No one knows the pain my children are suffering.""  For years the family home stood amid swathes of farmland, but now it lies behind a yellow gate, controlled by Israeli soldiers, who also patrol a narrow bridge overlooking the eight-metre (26-foot) fence.  ""During these years we've had a tough life,"" said Gharib, 40, who works for the Palestinian Authority in nearby Ramallah.  When he was a child, the Jewish settlement of Givon Hahadasha was built partially on land he says belonged to his family.   Decades on, the high fence separates the Gharib house from the Israelis' red-roofed homes and gardens. A communal space for the settlers, with a children's slide, has been placed a few metres (yards) away.  Settlements are deemed illegal by most of the international community, a judgement Israel rejects.  The Gharib family has fought numerous legal battles in Israeli courts, in 2012 winning the right to a small strip of the land they claim.  ""The settlers built a parking lot and a park, and we've needed the security forces to implement (the decision) and retrieve it for 10 years,"" said Gharib.  The yellow gate leading to the house was installed back in 2008, Gharib said, and at one point the family had to hold up their IDs to security cameras to cross the threshold.  ""(We) appealed to the high court... and the court permitted us to have the gate open all the time,"" Gharib said.    - 'Unpleasant' fence -    ""Disputes have broken out between us and the settlers,"" said Gharib, who lives with his wife and four children, as well as his mother.  Avi Zipory, a resident of the settlement, said he would prefer it if the ""unpleasant"" fence around the house was not there.  ""Two courts unanimously decided that the area and his house are within Jewish land,"" said the 70-year-old.  ""We didn't want to destroy his house... (he is) not ready to accept any alternative plan, (even) other land and a lot of money, that's why we had to continue this separation fence,"" he said.  Gharib has hung blue tarpaulins to create a screen between his home and the Givon Hahadasha settlement. ""So that the kids can play without being bothered by the settlers and fearing them,"" he explained.  Gharib said the situation has affected his children, particularly when there are clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces nearby.  ""My daughter couldn't sleep all night, for five hours, and she was afraid of the security forces that were stationed at the door of the house,"" said Gharib, recalling one incident.  Despite the difficulties, he still strives to harvest the family's olive trees.  To do so, he said he has to coordinate with the Israeli security forces and take a circuitous route through the neighbouring Palestinian village of Bayt Duqu. Once there, Gharib said he must wait ""an hour or two"" for soldiers to open another gate.  Gharib remains determined to stay on his land: ""This is our land which my father inherited from my grandfather. We will not sell it to anyone for all the money in the world.""  mab-rsc/bs/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

A resident of Mamuju, the capital of West Sulawesi, said damage across the city of some 110,000 was extensive, with one hospital severely damaged. Authorities had yet to confirm the information.   ""Roads are cracked and many buildings collapsed, including the governor's office as well as the hospital. The hospital has been flattened,"" said 28-year-old Hendra, who goes by one name.  ""The quake was very strong... I woke up and ran away with my wife.""  National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Raditya Jati said three people had been killed and 24 injured.  The country's search-and-rescue agency confirmed that at least one hotel had collapsed after the quake struck at 2:18 am local time Friday (1818 GMT Thursday).  The epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and the quake had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres, the United States Geological Survey said.

Another showed rescue workers checking on two sisters who were trapped under rubble. It was not clear where they were trapped.

Investors were relieved the new president took office safely after outgoing president Donald Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol earlier this month, and are now closely watching what Congress does with Biden's $1.9 trillion economic recovery plan.

Polls point to a first-round win for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator turned approachable head of state known for candid moments like queueing at the supermarket in shorts, plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized or sharing a meal with homeless people.  But observers have their eye on how a far-right challenger will perform as well as whether a lockdown-induced plunge in turnout among its electorate of 10.8 million -- who include some 1.5 million overseas voters -- could produce an upset.  Turnout stood at 17 percent at midday, an increase on the rate at the same time of day at the last presidential election five years ago.  Voters queued outside polling stations in the capital Lisbon, being let in one by one under social distancing rules.  ""To those who can and who want to vote, overcome your fears"", Rebelo de Sousa said after casting his ballot in Celorico de Basto, his stronghold in the northern region of Minho.  ""The vote is going well throughout the country, with distancing, respect for sanitary rules and patience on the part of the Portuguese,"" he added.    - National lockdown -    At a public library in the city centre, Fatima Cristo, a 63-year-old teacher, said she was pleased with the organisation, saying: ""It's not too intimidating, despite all this fear.""  Another voter, architect Jose Barra, 54, told AFP: ""Nothing would have stopped me from voting, but I think elderly people, for example, will be discouraged both by the virus and by the queues.""  As mail-in ballots are not well-established in Portugal, early voting was available last Sunday, drawing nearly 200,000 voters, though long lines may have defeated the purpose in some areas.  Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at braking a surge in coronavirus cases.  The country recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll and number of new infections on Saturday, bringing fatalities to over 10,000.  More than 80,000 infections were reported in the past week to Friday, the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its population of more than 10 million, according to an AFP tally based on government figures.  Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants.    - Keep it to one round -    At stake in the election is a post with the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power.  In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa -- one of the rare politicians often referred to simply by his first name -- urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round.  That would ""spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks"" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said.  ""An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable,"" the 72-year-old warned.  Low turnout could also upset the expected easy win for Rebelo de Sousa, with polls giving him 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of socialist challenger Ana Gomes and far-right populist Andre Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent.  A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way.    - Far-right challenge -    Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government.  He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist.  Meanwhile Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- ""Enough"" -- says he is in the running to ""crush the Left"", which is fielding three out of the seven candidates.  Portugal has so far to a large degree not seen the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years.  Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.

""An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable,"" the 72-year-old had warned.  Pre-election polls had given Rebelo de Sousa 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of Gomes and  Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent.  A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way.    - Far-right challenge -    Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government.  He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist.  Meanwhile Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- ""Enough"" -- had said he was in the running to ""crush the Left"", which fielded three out of the seven candidates.  Portugal has so far to a large degree not seen the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years.  Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.  bur-tsc/har/pvh",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48861733']

Guterres, releasing a UN report on the consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, urged governments to tax the companies' earnings.  ""It is immoral for oil and gas companies to be making record profits from this energy crisis on the backs of the poorest people and communities and at a massive cost to the climate,"" the UN chief told reporters.  ""I urge all governments to tax these excessive profits and use the funds to support the most vulnerable people through these difficult times,"" Guterres said.

Police said that a male suspect stormed the stage and attacked Rushdie and an interviewer, with the writer suffering ""an apparent stab wound to the neck.""  He was rushed by helicopter to a local hospital, police said, adding that his condition was not known.  New York governor Kathy Hochul said Rushdie was alive, and hailed him as ""an individual who has spent decades speaking truth to power.""  ""We condemn all violence, and we want people to be able to feel (the) freedom to speak and to write truth,"" she said.  A state trooper assigned to the event at the Chautauqua Institution, where Rushdie was due to give a talk, immediately took the suspect into custody.  Police gave no details about the suspect's identity or any probable motive.  Social media footage showed people rushing to Rushdie's aid and administrating emergency medical care. The interviewer also suffered a head injury in the attack.  The Chautauqua Institution -- which puts on arts and literary programming in a tranquil lakeside community seventy miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo -- said in a statement that it was coordinating with law enforcement and emergency officials.    - A decade in hiding -    Rushdie, 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" brought attention beyond his imagination when it sparked a fatwa, or religious decree, calling for his death by Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of the Prophet Mohammed.  Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practicing Muslims and today identifies as an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head -- which remains today.  He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell his children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.    - An 'essential voice' -    Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"" -- which runs to more than 600 pages -- has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  ""Just hours before the attack, on Friday morning, Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face,"" Nossel said in a statement.   ""Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman, wishing him a full and speedy recovery. We hope and believe fervently that his essential voice cannot and will not be silenced.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

The updated count from health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory said six children were among those killed since the start of the ""Israeli aggression"" on Friday, in addition to 204 people injured.  But Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket from Islamic Jihad militants had been responsible for the death of multiple children in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Saturday.   It was not immediately clear how many children were killed in the incident in Jabalia. An AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at an area hospital, including three minors.    Israel's military has warned its aerial and artillery campaign against Islamic Jihad could last a week, but Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Cairo is talking ""around the clock"" with both sides to ease the violence.    Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, as the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza.  Civilians meanwhile took refuge in air raid shelters on the Israeli side, with AFP journalists hearing sirens warning of incoming fire in the Tel Aviv area on Saturday evening.  In Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, women and children were trapped under rubble following an Israeli strike, the strip's civil defence unit said.   Rescue workers were digging through the site where a top Islamic Jihad commander, Khaled Mansour, was reportedly targeted by an Israeli strike on Saturday.   There was no specific confirmation of Mansour's death, but the head of the Israeli army's operations directorate, Oded Basiok, said in a statement that the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"".  Daily life in the strip has come to a standstill, while the electricity distributor said the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said the next few hours will be ""crucial and difficult"", warning it risked suspending vital services within 72 hours as a result of the lack of electricity.    - 'We are all alone' -    In Gaza City, resident Dounia Ismail said Palestinians have become accustomed to preparing a ""survival bag"" of items such as money and medicine.  ""This latest escalation brings back images of fear, anxiety, and the feeling that we are all alone,"" she told AFP.  On the Israeli side of the frontier, the Magen David Adom emergency service said two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others were lightly hurt while running for safety.  In Kibbutz Nahal Oz, an Israeli community beside the Gaza border, resident Nadav Peretz said he has been ""in the bomb shelter or around it"" since Friday.   ""We recognise that on the other side too there is an uninvolved civilian population, and on both sides children deserve to enjoy their summer vacation,"" the 40-year-old said.    - Five-year-old girl -    Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. Both are blacklisted as terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare-up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that conflict.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.  The UN humanitarian chief for the occupied Palestinian territories, Lynn Hastings, urged the warring sides to allow ""fuel, food, and medical supplies"" to be delivered to Gaza amid the worsening crisis.  On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl"" was among those killed by Israeli fire.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  The Gaza strikes follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, whom Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people in the West Bank it said were members of the group.

Israel has said it was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, insisting the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the Gaza border.    Health authorities in Gaza, a Palestinian enclave controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said 10 people have been killed by Israel's bombardment, including a five-year-old girl, with 79 others injured. Israel's army estimated that its operation has killed 15 militants.   Early on Saturday Israel broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, a group that is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently.  The Israeli army announced the arrest of 19 people it said were members of the group in the occupied West Bank, alongside the arrest of one other person.   Israel and Islamic Jihad have both confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key leader of the militants, in a Friday strike on a building in the west of Gaza city.   Islamic Jihad said that initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"", before it unleashed a barrage of rockets towards Israel.  The rocket fire and Israeli strikes were continuing early Saturday, risking a repeat of an 11-day conflict in May 2021 that devastated Gaza and forced countless Israelis to rush to bomb shelters.    - Escalation, mediation -    ""Israel isn't interested in a wider conflict in Gaza, but will not shy away from one either,"" Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in a nationally televised address on Friday.   Air raid sirens sounded across southern Israel early Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage, with many rockets intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defence system.  Officials in border areas urged people to stay close to shelters, which have also been opened in the commercial capital of Tel Aviv.   Egypt, a historic broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, was seeking to mediate and may host an Islamic Jihad delegation later Saturday, Egyptian officials told AFP in Gaza.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.   A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor.  The sides exchanged fire for several days without Hamas joining the fray.  Hamas's moves amid the current violence could prove crucial in determining its severity, with the group facing pressure from some to maintain calm in order to improve economic conditions in the territory.  Gaza City resident Abdullah al-Arayshi said the situation was ""very tense"".   ""The country is ravaged. We've had enough of wars. Our generation has lost its future,"" he told AFP.  Streets were largely deserted in Gaza City early Saturday, with many shops shuttered, and daily life largely paralysed, an AFP reporter said.       - Five-year-old girl -    Fire balls and plumes of smoke have billowed out of targets hit in Gaza, but there were no reports of new casualties in recent hours.   On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among those killed.   Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.   The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns.  The measures followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel has conducted a near relentless wave of raids inside the West Bank since mid-March in response to deadly attacks on Israeli citizens.   Islamic Jihad did not launch rockets after Saadi's arrest, but Israel has insisted through the week that the group was committed to seeking revenge.     bur-bs/dwo",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

The vote in the wealthy northeastern region could see a high level of abstentions as Spain battles a third wave of coronavirus infections.  Regional authorities ramped up restrictions to slow soaring case numbers after the Christmas holidays and while the situation has slightly improved, the figures are still high.  Polls suggest turnout could be around just 60 percent, compared to roughly 80 percent during the last regional election in December 2017. Some 5.5 million people are eligible to vote.  But over 40 percent of the 82,000 people assigned to help staff polling stations on the day have asked to be recused, despite pledges they will receive full protective suits.  The regional government has insisted that all necessary health and security measures are in place, providing antigen tests for election workers, as well as spacious, well-ventilated polling stations.   It has accepted only 23,300 of the requests.  Polling stations opened at 9 am (0800 GMT) under cloudy skies and will close at 8 pm, with results expected at around midnight.     - Separatists eye majority -    The drop in turnout adds to the uncertainty of the outcome.  Polls put the Socialists who govern at the national level neck-and-neck with the two pro-independence parties which have governed Catalonia since the last polls in 2017.  But the vote has been overshadowed by a bitter split between the separatist factions following the failed 2017 independence bid that sparked Spain's worst political crisis in decades.   The Catalan government has been dominated by separatists since 2015, but Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is hoping this election, the fifth in a decade, could end their rule.  He himself came to lead Spain's government in 2018 thanks in part to support from Catalan separatists. Even today, his minority government relies on them to pass legislation.  But Sanchez has not hidden his desire to remove them from power.  To that end, former health minister Salvador Illa is spearheading the Socialists' bid to unseat the separatists in Sunday's election. Sanchez has even taken part in some electoral meetings himself.    - Post-election deal-making -    However, even if Illa's Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) comes out on top, polls suggest none of the parties will win an outright majority of 68 in the 135-seat regional parliament.  And that means the eventual outcome will depend on deal-making.  Forming a government ""will probably be quite challenging"" and prospects of a repeat election cannot be ruled out, says Antonio Barroso, an analyst at political consultancy Teneo.  And while the separatist parties remain deeply divided, polls suggest the hardline JxC -- ""Together for Catalonia"" -- and the more moderate ERC could once again cobble together a ruling majority.  Both this week formally ruled out a coalition with the socialists.  ""The secessionists face better government-formation prospects since non-separatist parties are unlikely to form a united front,"" said Barroso.  The main question then is which of the two will come out stronger.  In the previous election in December 2017, JxC was ahead, forming a 70-seat coalition with ERC.  Should the tables be turned in ERC's favour, it would likely ease tensions and help the tentative reconciliation Sanchez's government has sought to broker since coming to power.   ""An ERC executive would maintain the current ambiguous approach of criticising Madrid rhetorically but not adopting any unilateral measures,"" said Barroso.  ""In contrast, a government headed by JxC would probably lead to a more confrontational stance.""  dbh/ds/wdb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48838589']

On Sunday, demonstrators defied government warnings and rallied from the Pacific port of Vladivostok to the northwestern city of Pskov in a second weekend of mass protest over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent.  The protests, which saw authorities enforce an unprecedented lockdown of the centre of Moscow, came ahead of a high-profile court hearing that could see Navalny imprisoned for several years.  Navalny's detention and the crackdown on protesters has sparked an outcry in the West.  The 44-year-old is facing charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for embezzlement and could be jailed for two-and-a-half years.  The General Prosecutor's Office said in a statement on Monday that it backed a request by the prison service to change the suspended sentence to jail time.  ""This motion is considered lawful and justified,"" the statement said.   Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning.   He blames the attack with the Novichok nerve agent on Putin and the FSB security agency.    - Batons and tasers -    The anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a high-security detention centre and faces years of jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from Western governments for his release.  Navalny's team has urged his sympathisers to gather in front of Moscow's Simonovsky district court on Tuesday to show support for the opposition politician.  In recent years, Navalny has served a number of brief jail stints but never a long prison term.  On Sunday, thousands of people rallied across Russia to demand freedom for Navalny and changes to Russia's tightly-controlled political system.  OVD Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 5,300 people had been detained.  Nearly 1,800 people were held in Moscow and almost 1,200 in Saint Petersburg, Russia's second city.  More than 90 journalists were detained, OVD Info said.   Ahead of Sunday's demonstration, authorities locked down the centre of the capital, with hundreds of police lining the streets, central metro stations closed and restrictions on the movements of pedestrians.  Protesters who had hoped to gather outside FSB headquarters were instead scattered to various parts of the city as organisers made last-minute changes in locations.  Protesters and monitors pointed to the police's harsh tactics, saying they used batons and tasers on peaceful demonstrators, and some were badly beaten.  Valery Fadeyev, the head of the Kremlin's human rights council, denounced the rallies as a ""provocation"".    - 'Path towards trouble' -    But the Saint Petersburg ombudsman said authorities unleashed ""essentially a military operation"" against protesters and paralysed the city.  ""Batons and tasers will not solve existing problems. Violence only breeds intransigence and engenders bitterness,"" ombudsman Alexander Shishlov said in a statement.  ""This is a path towards great trouble. It's time to stop.""  Kremlin critics say a concerted effort is under way to silence Navalny's team, dismantle his Anti-Corruption Foundation and pressure his family.  Ahead of Sunday's demonstrations, Navalny's brother Oleg and several key allies including prominent activist Lyubov Sobol were placed under house arrest until March 23 for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions and calling on people to join protests.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Twitter condemned ""the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists by Russian authorities for a second week straight"".  On Monday, France urged Germany to scrap the Nordstream II gas pipeline project with Russia in protest at Navalny's detention.

The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN were among outlets reporting that Zawahiri was the target of what the White House announced was a ""successful"" operation against a top-level target in Afghanistan.  Biden was to deliver a televised address on the operation at 2330 GMT.  Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run for 20 years since the 9/11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in the United States.  He took over Al-Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.   A senior US official said the US had carried out a ""successful"" operation against a ""significant"" Al-Qaeda target in Afghanistan over the weekend.  It would be the first known over-the-horizon strike by the United States on an Al-Qaeda target in Afghanistan since American forces withdrew from the country on August 31, 2021.   US officials did not clarify where in Afghanistan the strike took place.   Over the weekend the Afghan interior ministry denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike in Kabul, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in the capital, causing no casualties.  Early Tuesday in Kabul, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out on a residence in the Sherpur area of the city.  ""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first. The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones,"" his tweet said.  In recent months the Taliban have largely barred media from covering the aftermath of security incidents and frequently deny or downplay any casualties.  The news comes a week before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the control of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces over the preceding two decades.  The US withdrew after the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke their ties with Al-Qaeda.    - Doctor turned jihadist    Zawahiri, 71, lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world, but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.  He was believed to be the main strategist -- the real mastermind who steered operations, including the September 11 attacks, as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.  Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.  He became involved with Egypt's radical Muslim community at a young age and published several books on Islamic fundamentalism, which came for many to symbolize the radical Islamist movement.  He left Egypt in the mid-1980s and headed for Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar where the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based.  It was at that time, when thousands of Islamist fighters flooded into Afghanistan during the 1980s, that Zawahiri and bin Laden met.  In the early 1990s Zawahiri is believed to have lived in Europe before joining bin Laden in Sudan or Afghanistan.  In 1998 he was one of five signatories to bin Laden's ""fatwa"" calling for attacks against Americans and he began appearing regularly at the Al-Qaeda leader's side.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']

""On the advice of our medical team, the Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26,"" tweeted Jen Psaki, Biden's press secretary.  ""In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19.""  ""With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,"" she added.  Just minutes prior to Psaki's tweet, President Trump said he would lift the travel ban on Europe and Brazil, although travel bans for China and Iran would remain in place. ""This action is the best way to continue protecting Americans from COVID-19 while enabling travel to resume safely,"" he said in a statement released by the White House.  Trump had announced an initial ban on January 31, 2020 on non-American travelers entering from China to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The ban was extended to European countries on March 14, the US shutting itself off from the world as the pandemic entered full force.  Both Biden and Trump's statements come days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that all air passengers bound for the US will be required to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their departure.  The test policy will take effect on January 26, and expands on a previous testing rule that targeted Britain and came into effect in December, following the emergence of a coronavirus variant believed to be more transmissible.  Some epidemiologists have warned it is likely that new, more transmissible variants are already establishing themselves in the United States, the hardest-hit country in the world by the pandemic.  Biden will be inaugurated on Wednesday, after a rocky handover of power and in the midst of an alarming surge of Covid-19 cases in the US.  Trump for months had refused to accept the outcome of the November 3 election, baselessly insisting the vote had been rigged and ignoring court rulings to the contrary, leaving the country seething with division and anger.

Iraq veteran Pat Ryan narrowly beat career politician Marc Molinaro in upstate New York's 19th District late Tuesday, defying expectations that the seat would flip to the Republicans.  Pundits have focused on the Hudson Valley swing district -- won at least once by each of the last three presidents -- as a trial run of the parties' general election messages.   Democrats said the key to victory was anger over the Supreme Court's hugely contentious decision -- known as ""Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization"" -- ending the federally-protected right to abortion.  Ryan hammered his pro-abortion rights message during the campaign, declaring loudly and often that ""choice is on the ballot,"" while Molinaro focused on inflation and crime.   The 40-year-old victor said he had run because ""the foundations of our democracy were and remain under direct threat,"" according to his local paper, the Times Union.  ""When the Supreme Court ripped away reproductive rights, access to abortion rights, we said: 'This is not what America stands for.'""  Ryan hadn't led in any poll and even the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had his opponent eight points ahead in a survey released just ahead of the vote.    - Democrats 'more engaged' -    Yet, as with the other three special House elections held since the June 24 high court ruling, the Democratic candidate bettered President Joe Biden's 2020 performance.   Biden carried the district by fewer than two points in 2020, after Donald Trump took it by about seven points in 2016 and Barack Obama won there by a similar amount in 2012.  Democrats are now arguing that the race provides the most encouraging sign yet that November's midterm election might not be the bloodbath many have been anticipating.   ""Lots of focus on Dems being more engaged/energetic post-Dobbs, which is undeniably true,"" election analyst Dave Wasserman of The Cook Political Report tweeted.  ""But to me, the GOP/Trump base appears less engaged than it was last November, which is just as big a part of the story.""  US voters will decide control of Congress in the midterm elections, with all 435 House seats up for grabs, as well as 35 of the 100 Senate seats and the governor's mansion in 36 out of 50 states.  Democratic strategists say enthusiasm and energy among liberals has shot up since Dobbs, pointing to research from political data firm Target Smart showing women outpacing men in new voter registrations in numerous states.  The data shows four Democrats registering for every Republican in the key battleground of Pennsylvania.    ""This isn't just a blue state phenomena. In fact, it is more pronounced in states where choice is more at risk, or has been eliminated by the decision,"" TargetSmart CEO Tom Bonier tweeted last week.  bur-ft/wd",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112811646']

Excavators and cranes were deployed across the devastated seaside city of Mamuju, where buildings were reduced to a tangled mass of twisted metal and chunks of concrete, including a hospital and the regional governor's office.  It was unclear how many people -- dead or alive -- could still be under the mountains of debris in the aftermath of Friday's 6.2-magnitude quake, as scores of rescuers combed through the destruction, filling body bags with corpses.  Police on Sunday deployed a K-9 unit of sniffer dogs to help in the search at a badly damaged hospital.  ""The rain poses risks because damaged buildings could collapse if it gets too heavy...and aftershocks could move them too,"" said rescuer Octavianto.  But moving debris too fast with heavy equipment could crush and kill any buried survivors.  ""All the victims we've found so far were dead,"" said Octavianto, 37, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.  ""It is most likely any more victims are already dead if 24 hours has passed,"" he added.  Most victims were found in Mamuju, but some were also recovered south of the city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province.  Friday's tremor triggered panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  ""We heard a roaring sound and the house started shaking,"" said survivor Jumardi, 50, from a shelter where he and six family members took refuge.  ""All I had in my mind was that I would die... Everyone was panicking.""  Authorities have not given a figure for how many survivors have been rescued.  A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.  Meanwhile, corpses were recovered from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.  - Running low on food, supplies -    Doctors treated patients with broken limbs and other injuries at a makeshift medical centre, set up outside the only hospital in Mamuju that survived relatively intact.  Wawan, who was buried under his house until neighbours pulled him to freedom, initially didn't want to go into a hospital to treat his broken foot, fearing another quake.  ""I was traumatised,"" the 27-year-old said.  ""But people convinced me that the doctors were treating patients outside the building, so I agreed to go.""  Thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with whole families.  They said they were running low on food, blankets and other aid, as emergency supplies were rushed to the hard-hit region.  Many survivors are unable to return to their destroyed homes, or were too scared to go back, fearing a tsunami sparked by aftershocks, common after strong earthquakes.  ""It's better to take shelter before something worse happens,"" said Mamuju resident Abdul Wahab, from inside a tent with his wife and four children, one of whom is just a baby.  Fearing an outbreak of coronavirus in the crowded camps, authorities were trying to separate high and low risk groups.  - Disaster-prone -    Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, has been hit by a series of natural disasters this week.  Landslides sparked by torrential rains killed at least 32 on Java island, while dozens are dead or missing after severe flooding pounded another part of Sulawesi and Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo.  Volcano Mount Semeru shot a plume of ash and debris some 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) into the sky Saturday night as bright red lava flowed down from its crater. There were no reports of casualties.  Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.  In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  And on December 26, 2004, a massive 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including 170,000 in Indonesia -- among the worst recorded disasters in history.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

Two weeks to the day after Trump supporters violently rampaged at the US Capitol to overturn the election results, Biden headed to the same very steps alongside Kamala Harris, who will become the first woman vice president.  ""It's a new day in America,"" Biden wrote on Twitter before the inauguration as, in a sign of his push for unity, he prayed alongside congressional leaders at a Roman Catholic church.  Biden, who at 78 will be the oldest president in US history and only the second Catholic, takes office amid enormous challenges with the still-raging Covid-19 pandemic having claimed 400,000 lives in the United States.

""It's a day a lot of us have been trying to visualize for a long time. We couldn't have guessed that the visual would be quite like this,"" Pete Buttigieg, the former presidential contender tapped by Biden as transportation secretary, told reporters.  Biden, who was vice president under Barack Obama and first ran for president in 1987, plans to kick off his tenure with a flurry of 17 orders to turn the page on Trump's divisive reign.  Officials said Biden will immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord and stop the US exit from the World Health Organization and set new paths on immigration, the environment, Covid-19 and the economy.  He will also end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.    - Trump vows to be back -    For the first time in 152 years, the sitting president did not accompany his successor to the inauguration after Trump for two months falsely alleged that fraud cost him a second term.

""This has been an incredible four years,"" Trump told several hundred cheering supporters in a campaign-style event before flying off for the last time in Air Force One en route to his Florida resort.  ""We will be back in some form,"" vowed Trump, who retains a hold on much of the Republican Party despite being the first president to be impeached twice.  Trump did not address Biden by name but, in a rare hint of graciousness, wished the next administration ""great luck and great success.""

Bush and Bill Clinton and their wives -- including Hillary Clinton, for whom Biden's victory was especially sweet four years after her narrow, surprise defeat to Trump.    - Last-minute Trump pardons -    In one of his last acts before departing the White House, Trump issued scores of pardons to people convicted of crimes or facing charges, including several key allies.  Influential former Trump aide Steve Bannon -- charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall, a flagship Trump policy -- was among 73 people on a list released by the White House.  However, neither Trump nor his relatives were listed, amid speculation he could use the legally dubious tactic of a preemptive pardon to fend off future charges.  Former Trump fund-raiser Elliott Broidy was similarly pardoned, after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws.  The rapper Lil Wayne, who last month pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, and faced 10 years in jail, also made the list.  Trump will still be in focus at the Capitol as the Senate considers convicting him after he was impeached for inciting the mob earlier this month.  The spectacle will clash with the opening days of Biden's tenure, as the new president seeks to swiftly confirm his Cabinet picks and push through ambitious legislation -- including a $1.9 trillion rescue package.  Many overseas leaders breathed a sigh of relief at the end of Trump's hawkish, go-it-alone presidency, with Biden's team pledging greater cooperation with the rest of the world.  Iran's President Hassan Rouhani hailed the departure of ""tyrant"" Trump, saying ""the ball is in America's court"" to return to a landmark nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Tehran.  Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Biden's inauguration would ""be a demonstration of the resilience of American democracy,"" as well as ""the resounding proof that, once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House.""  bur-sct/ec",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Arauz came out top with 31.5 percent of the vote, with Perez on 20.04 percent, following Sunday's polls that were marred by long lines of people waiting to cast ballots as coronavirus restrictions caused chaos.  Right-wing ex-banker Guillermo Lasso, who was initially expected to face Arauz in a runoff, received 19.97 percent, according to the electoral body's first count.  To win outright, a candidate needs 50 percent plus one vote or 40 percent and a 10-point lead over the nearest rival.  Arauz, a protege of former president Rafael Correa, claimed a ""resounding victory in all regions of our beautiful country"" although he urged supporters to wait for official results before celebrating.  The projection was based on 90.4 percent of the results from the 2,425 polling stations selected for the quick count, according to Election Council president Diana Atamaint.  The vote took place amid a backdrop of economic problems exacerbated by a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has swept Latin America and claimed 15,000 lives in Ecuador.  Strict health precautions appeared to slow voting, and may have discouraged some from casting their ballots as long lines stretched outside polling stations.  ""I hope that at last we will elect a president who is not corrupt, and that there are changes, Sebastian Amaguaya, 23, told AFP as he waited to vote.  The country's 13.1 million voters were choosing a successor to unpopular socialist President Lenin Moreno and the 137 members of the unicameral congress.  The field had been congested, with 16 candidates, including Ximena Pena, the only woman.    - End to austerity? -    Arauz, 36, represents the Union of Hope (UNES) coalition of left-wing parties, while lawyer Perez, 51, is from the left-wing Pachakutik party.  Arauz's mentor Correa -- a two-time president who currently lives in Belgium to evade a conviction for corruption -- remains a strong force in the country.  ""People have voted not in direct support to Arauz but because he is the Correa candidate,"" political scientist Karen Garzon Sherdek, from the International University SEK, told AFP.  ""Thank you dear Ecuador!"" Correa tweeted as the results came in. ""The Citizen Revolution has won overwhelmingly, despite a dirty campaign and 4 years of brutal persecution and infamy.""  Arauz has promised to return the country to a socialist path after a four-year, austerity-driven hiatus under Moreno.  He has pledged to disburse $1,000 to a million families during his first month in office, as well as a special tax on the rich.    - Under pressure -    Ecuador is mired in debt as the profits of an oil boom during the Correa presidency dried up under Moreno as the price of crude crashed.  National debt rose from 26 percent of GDP to 44 percent during Moreno's term.  The coronavirus epidemic has piled on the pressure, with some $6.4 billion in losses attributed directly to the health crisis, according to government data.  Ecuador's economy is forecast to contract 8.9 percent in 2020, while unemployment reached 8.6 percent last September -- more than doubling in nine months.  Moreno, his popularity at an all-time low of seven percent, did not seek reelection. His four-year term will end on May 24.  sp-pld/vel/bc/mdl/to/rma","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q76763779', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84078919']"

The negotiations raise hopes that Egypt could help broker a deal to end the worst fighting in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the impoverished coastal territory, home to some 2.3 million Palestinians.  Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation.  At least 31 Palestinians have been killed including six children, and 275 people have been wounded since Friday, health authorities said in the enclave where several buildings were reduced to rubble.  Two Israelis have been wounded by shrapnel, and others forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza.  Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said officials were talking with both sides ""around the clock"" to ease the violence. A security source in Cairo said that Israel ""has accepted"" a ceasefire, adding that Cairo was waiting for the Palestinian response.  A source from Islamic Jihad said that ""discussions are underway at the highest levels towards calm"", but warned that ""the resistance will not stop if the occupation's (Israel) aggression and crimes do not stop"".  On Sunday, Islamic Jihad -- an Iran-backed group designated as a terrorist organisation by several Western nations -- extended their barrage to fire two rockets targeting Jerusalem, but they were shot down by the army.  The Israeli army has said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"".  Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said  medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.  ""Every minute we receive injured people,"" he said, earlier on Sunday.  - 'Torn apart' -    In Gaza, run by the Islamist group Hamas, the health ministry said 31 people had been killed.  But Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Gaza's northern Jabalia area on Saturday.  It was not immediately clear how many children were killed there, but an AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the local hospital including three minors.  ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   The army said it had struck 139 Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing over 600 rockets and mortars, but with more than a hundred of those projectiles falling short inside Gaza.  Amid the high tensions, Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.  Some Palestinians shouted ""God is greatest"" in response, and an AFP photographer was briefly detained by Israeli police, but commemorations passed off without major incident.  Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation Friday against Islamic Jihad, which it said was planning an imminent attack.  The army has killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south.  Israel's Lapid called the killing of Mansour an ""extraordinary achievement"".    - 'Killing and wounding' -    Daily life in the Gaza Strip has come to a standstill, with the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA has warned of the ""severe risk"" to the ""continuation of basic essential services"".  ""Each day we wake up to child and women martyrs... there is killing and wounding and people displaced,"" said Gaza City resident Abu Mohammed al-Madhoun, 56. ""We hope that Israeli aggression will end"".  In southern and central Israel, civilians were forced into air raid shelters. Two people were hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others lightly hurt while running for safety, the Magen David Adom emergency service said.  ""It's tense, it's frightening,"" said Beverly Jamil, a resident of Ashkelon close to Gaza.  ""Ashkelon's a ghost town -- it's a holiday, kids should be out playing.""  Hamas's response to the violence remains critical, with spokesman Fawzi Barhoum offering the group's support to Islamic Jihad on Sunday, but stopping short of saying they would take part.  ""The resistance in all its military wings and factions are united in this battle,"" Barhoum said.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.  bur-pjm/it",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

By a lopsided vote of 81-13, well more than the two-thirds of the 100-member chamber required, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the $740.5 billion National Defense Authorization Act to fund the military for fiscal 2021.   The Democratic-led House of Representatives had voted 322 to 87 on Monday to override Trump's veto.   Both houses of Congress had easily passed the legislation in early December by strong majorities, but Trump, citing a litany of objections, vetoed it on December 23.  ""It's time for us to deliver this bill,"" Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said at the start of Friday's session.   ""It's our chance to remind brave servicemembers and their families that we have their backs.""  The vote completed a stunning rebuke in the waning weeks of Trump's presidency.   It came in an extraordinary New Year's Day session necessitated by his veto, possibly the final act of the outgoing Congress.   New members will be sworn in on Sunday, just 17 days before Democrat Joe Biden is inaugurated to succeed Trump.    - Trump's complaints -    Breaking with members of his party, Trump had criticized the defense bill on numerous grounds.  He called it a ""gift"" to China and Russia and said it restricted his ability to lower troop numbers in Afghanistan, South Korea and elsewhere.  Trump had bristled at language to rename military installations that currently honor leaders of the breakaway Civil War-era Confederacy.   He also insisted the bill should include a repeal of a federal law, known as Section 230, that provides liability protection to internet companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, which he regularly accuses of anti-conservative bias.  There was no immediate reaction Friday from the president, but earlier, in a series of angry tweets, he denounced the ""weak and tired Republican 'leadership'"" in Congress, which he said would ""allow the bad Defense Bill to pass.""   That, he said, would represent ""a disgraceful act of cowardice and total submission by weak people to Big Tech.""  But members of the president's own Republican Party -- which traditionally prides itself as strong on defense -- underscored the importance of the bill.  ""It's absolutely vital to our national security and our troops,"" said Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  ""Our men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform shouldn't be denied what they need -- ever.""  Democrats in both chambers had slammed Trump's veto. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it ""an act of recklessness.""  Senator Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said Friday on the Senate floor that the bill was ""essential"" in bolstering the nation's cybersecurity against the type of widespread targeted attack that recently hit both the government and some private companies.  As to Trump's remark that Moscow and Beijing might approve of the bill, Reed said that any such suggestion was ""completely baseless.""  On the Senate floor Friday, Inhofe and Reed repeatedly congratulated each other for their months-long collaboration on the sweeping bill -- a rare instance of cross-aisle cooperation in the deeply divided Congress.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is under occupation by Moscow's troops and was disconnected from the national power supply on Thursday, the state energy operator said.  The United States cautioned Russia against redirecting energy from the site.  ""The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.  ""No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponise or divert energy from the plant.""  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine had informed it the plant temporarily lost connection -- ""further underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to travel to the facility"".  ""We can't afford to lose any more time. I'm determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days,"" the organisation's Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.  White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre urged Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant and ""allow the IAEA to visit as soon as possible to check on the safety.""  The Zaporizhzhia plant -- Europe's largest nuclear facility -- has been occupied by Russian troops in southern Ukraine since the opening weeks of the war, and remained on the frontlines ever since.  Recently Moscow and Kyiv have traded blame for shelling around the complex, a ""highly volatile"" development the IAEA says ""underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"".  President Volodymyr Zelensky described Russian actions around the plant as a menace.  ""Russia has put Ukrainians as well as all Europeans one step away from radiation disaster,"" he said in his nightly address.  President Joe Biden, in a telephone call with Zelensky, called for Russia to return full control of the plant and let in UN nuclear inspectors, the White House said.  Zelensky said earlier on Thursday he had spoken with Biden and thanked him for the United States' ""unwavering"" support.  ""We discussed Ukraine's further steps on our path to the victory over the aggressor and importance of holding Russia accountable for war crimes"", Zelensky said on Twitter.  Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to increase the headcount of his country's army to more than two million, including 1.15 million servicemen, from next January, according to the document published on a government portal.   Putin last set the army headcount in 2017 at around 1.9 million people with 1.01 million soldiers.  Ukraine state operator Energoatom said the Zaporizhzhiaplant was severed from the national network after a power line was twice disconnected by ash pit fires in an adjacent thermal power plant.  The three other power lines ""were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks"" by Russian forces, the operator said.  ""The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) from the power grid -- the first in the history of the plant,"" Energoatom added on Telegram.  It added that ""start-up operations are under way to connect one of the reactors to the network"".  Kyiv officials have said they believe Moscow has seized the station in order to divert power to the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.  Energoatom could not be immediately reached for comment on whether the supply had been diverted, the cause of the ash pit fires, or the number of those without electricity.  However, the mayor of the city of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov said ""Russian occupiers cut off the electricity in almost all occupied settlements of Zaporizhzhia"".      - Independence day deaths -    Meanwhile on Thursday the death toll from an air strike on a train station in central Ukraine rose to 25, as the EU warned those ""responsible for Russian rocket terror will be held accountable"".  Russia issued a counter-claim saying it targeted soldiers and killed 200 Ukrainian servicemen in the attack Wednesday on a rail hub in Chaplyne city of the Dnipropetrovsk region.   The attack struck six months to the day since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine and also on the day Ukraine celebrated its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union.  On Thursday, state rail operator Ukrainian Railways said the toll had risen overnight from 22 to 25, and included two children with a further 31 people injured.  In a daily press briefing, Moscow's defence ministry said the train was ""en route to combat zones"" in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, which Russia seeks to fully control.  But EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell ""strongly"" condemned ""another heinous attack by Russia on civilians"".  The UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown said the strike ""is just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine"".  Ukraine claimed Thursday to have repatriated 53 children it said were illegally taken to Russia for adoption but gave no details about the operation.  bur-jts/cdw/lcm/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The election has been overshadowed by Angola's many woes -- a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought, compounded by the death of a former strongman president.  The People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which has ruled the oil-rich nation for nearly five decades, is facing its most serious challenge since the first multiparty vote in 1992.  Eight political parties are running, but the real contest lies between the MPLA and its long-standing rival and ex-rebel movement the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  Opinion polls suggest that support for the MPLA -- which won 61 percent of the vote in 2017 elections -- will dwindle, while the UNITA -- which has entered an electoral pact with two other parties -- will make gains.   But UNITA's inroads might not be enough to unseat Lourenco, 68, who succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago.  Dozens of voters lined up at polling stations in the early morning, but by midday they were just a trickle.  After casting his ballot at the capital's Lusiada University, Lourenco urged Angolans to come out and vote to ensure ""it is democracy that wins"".  Voting in the working-class Nova Vida district, his rival Costa Junior called for ""full turnout and for all ballots to be counted.""    - 'Closer than ever' -    Costa Junior, 60, is popular among youth -- a significant and growing voting bloc -- and has pledged to ""eradicate poverty"" and create jobs.  Analyst Justin Pearce said the race looked ""very competitive"".  ""The further we've gotten from the civil war, the less currency... the MPLA has had,"" said the history lecturer at South Africa's Stellenbosch University.  But ""the opposition has become more organised and found some synergy with society.  ""The outcome looks like it's going to be closer than ever before.""   The MPLA traditionally wields a grip over the electoral process and state media in Angola, but the opposition is urging supporters not to be intimidated.  Opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering, and social media is rife with claims of dead people registered to vote.  The opposition has asked supporters to peacefully monitor the counting process and stage sit-ins outside polling places after voting closes.  In the working-class district of Cazenga, 57-year-old Miguel said he would accept the vote's outcome, whatever it was.  ""We have to accept the results, it's the democratic game,"" he said, without giving his surname.  But Alberto Bernardo Muxibo, who described himself as a civil society activist, disagreed.   ""We don't have a real democracy. The government oppresses the people,"" he said.    - Poverty and graft -    Lourenco, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised a new era for Angola when he was first elected, has trumpeted a list of achievements.  He is credited with making far-reaching reforms in one of southern Africa's economic powerhouses.  They include boosting financial transparency and efficiency in parastatal organisations, and promoting business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors.  Johannesburg-based analyst Marisa Lourenco said Lourenco's handling of the debt racked up by his predecessor had been ""remarkable"".  ""The West would not mind an MPLA victory -- even with concerns of vote rigging,"" she said.  ""Governments and companies abroad prefer stability over change"".  But little has changed for most of Angola's 33 million people, for whom life is a daily grind.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza also nurtured corruption and nepotism under dos Santos, who died in Spain last month.  The low-key, night-time repatriation of his remains in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre touch to the election.   Dos Santos will be buried on Sunday, which would have been his 80th birthday.  Some 14.7 million people are registered to vote at 13,200 polling stations across the vast southern African nation.  Angolans living overseas are for the first time able to cast ballots from abroad.  Results are expected within a few days. In past elections, results have been contested, in a process that can take several weeks.  bur-sn/ub/ah","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q108516285', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112262515', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113614207']"

The statements came on a shocking day for the United States, which saw mobs overrun Congress after a rally by Trump, who had sought to thwart the process of lawmakers certifying election results.  That was the final administrative step before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden enters the White House later this month, but the normally ceremonial affair spiraled into mayhem.  ""Today marks a sad and shameful chapter in our nation's history,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Twitter late Wednesday.   ""Those responsible for this insurrection should be held to account, and we must complete the transition to President-elect Biden's administration. It's especially when they are challenged that our ideals matter most.""  The Business Roundtable issued a statement calling on ""the president and all relevant officials to put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power.""  The lobbying group, which represents over 200 chief executives, blamed the events on ""unlawful efforts to overturn the legitimate results of a democratic election. The country deserves better.""   US Chamber of Commerce CEO Thomas J. Donohue said: ""The attacks against our nation's Capitol Building and our democracy must end now,"" and Congress should ""conclude their Constitutional responsibility"" to certify the winner of the presidential vote.  Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers went further, calling on Vice President Mike Pence to ""seriously consider"" invoking the US constitution's 25th amendment, which would allow him to temporarily become president after Trump is deemed incapacitated.  The group has been viewed as supportive of Trump's agenda of protecting American manufacturers, but Timmons said, ""The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy.""    - 'Coup' attempt -    Without referring to the assault on the Capitol, Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Twitter, ""Violence is always unacceptable. We must respect our constitution and democratic process.""  The attack saw flag-waving Trump supporters break down barricades outside the iconic white-domed building and swarm its halls, sending sessions of the House and Senate into an emergency recess.  That interrupted the effort by some lawmakers from Trump's Republican party to mount a quixotic attempt to delay certification of Biden's win.  In extraordinary images, armed security personnel were seen barricading the chamber with weapons drawn, while lawmakers huddled inside wearing gas masks.  Labor leader Richard Trumka, president of the powerful AFL-CIO, called the unrest ""one of the greatest assaults on our democracy since the Civil War"" from 1861 to 1865.  ""Today's attempted coup has been years in the making as Donald Trump consistently spews venom, conspiracies, hate and lies to his supporters,"" he said in a statement.  While avoiding Trump's name, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said ""our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transfer of power.""   Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat, said he was ""disgusted"" by the attack, but added, ""While these scenes are very difficult to watch, I have faith in our Democratic process... and that people will be held accountable for their actions.""  Arvind Krishan, chairman and CEO of technology giant IBM, said the company ""condemns today's unprecedented lawlessness and we call for it to end immediately.

""I've decided not to meddle in political affairs. I therefore announce now my definitive retirement,"" said Sadr, a longtime player in the war-torn country's political scene, though he himself has never directly been in government.  He made the announcement on Twitter, where he added that ""all the institutions"" linked to his Sadrist movement will be closed, except the mausoleum of his father, assassinated in 1999, and other heritage facilities.  His latest statement came two days after he said ""all parties"" including his own should give up government positions in order to help resolve the months-long political crisis.  Since legislative elections in October last year, political deadlock has left the country without a new government, prime minister or president, due to disagreement between factions over forming a coalition.  His bloc emerged from last year's election as the biggest, with 73 seats, but short of a majority. In June, his lawmakers quit in a bid to break the logjam, which led to a rival Shiite bloc, the pro-Iran Coordination Framework, becoming the largest in the legislature.   Since then, Sadr has engaged in other pressure tactics, including a mass prayer by tens of thousands of his followers on August 5.    - Millions of followers -    His supporters have been calling for parliament to be dissolved and for new elections, but on Saturday he said it is ""more important"" that ""all parties and figures who have been part of the political process"" since the 2003 US-led invasion ""no longer participate"".  ""That includes the Sadrist movement,"" he said, adding that he was willing to sign an agreement to that effect ""within 72 hours"".  The grey-bearded preacher has millions of devoted followers and once led a militia against American and Iraqi government forces, following the toppling of dictator Saddam Hussein in the invasion.  Over the years, the chameleon-like figure has taken various positions and then reversed them.  Sadr's supporters have for weeks been staging a sit-in outside Iraq's parliament, after initially storming the legislature's interior on July 30, to press their demands.  They were angered after the Coordination Framework nominated a candidate they saw as unacceptable for prime minister.  The Framework wants a new head of government to be appointed before any new polls are held.  Caretaker Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi earlier this month convened crisis talks with party leaders, but the Sadrists boycotted.  Iraqis say the political infighting has nothing to do with their day-to-day struggles.  Iraq has been ravaged by decades of conflict and endemic corruption.  Oil-rich but blighted by ailing infrastructure, unemployment, power cuts and crumbling public services, Iraq now also faces water shortages as drought ravages swathes of the country.   As a result of past deals, the Sadrists have representatives at the highest levels of government ministries and have been accused by their opponents of being as corrupt as other political forces.   But supporters of Sadr view him as a champion of the anti-corruption fight.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113646367']

Hundreds were also injured when the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours, triggering panic among the terrified residents of the island, which was hit by a huge quake and tsunami two and a half years ago that killed thousands.  So far, 34 bodies have been hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of about 110,000 in West Sulawesi province, while another eight were killed south of the area after the quake struck.  ""We don't know how many more are missing,"" said Arianto from the rescue agency in Mamuju, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.  ""There are still people trapped beneath the rubble.""  Rescuers were searching for more than a dozen patients and staff trapped under a levelled Mamuju hospital.   ""The hospital is flattened -- it collapsed,"" Arianto said.  Earlier Friday, rescuers said they were also trying to reach a family of eight who were under their destroyed home.  At least one hotel had partially collapsed, while the regional governor's office also suffered extensive damage after the quake struck at 2:18 am local time Friday (1818 GMT Thursday).  A Mamuju resident said damage across the city was severe.  ""Roads are cracked and many buildings collapsed,"" said 28-year-old Hendra, who also goes by one name.  ""The quake was very strong... I woke up and ran away with my wife.""  - Tsunami panic -    Images from the scene showed residents trying to flee the seaside city in cars and motorbikes as they drove past corrugated metal roofs and other building debris scattered on the roadside.   But landslides triggered by heavy rains and the quake blocked the main access road out of Mamuju.  The meteorological agency warned residents that the area could be hit by strong aftershocks and to avoid the beachfront in case of a tsunami.  ""The aftershocks could be as strong, or stronger, than this morning's quake,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, chief of the meteorological agency.  ""There is potential for a tsunami from subsequent aftershocks... Don't wait for a tsunami first because they can happen very quickly,"" she added.  The warning sparked more fear in the quake-jolted city.  ""(Everyone) is panicking,"" Mamuju resident Zulkifli Pagessa told AFP.  The city's airport had also been damaged, authorities said.  The Indonesian Red Cross said it was rushing medical and relief supplies to the scene, with its teams working to help find trapped residents.  ""Our first priority is to search for survivors and tend to the wounded,"" said Sudirman Said, secretary general of the local Red Cross.   ""These hours are critical for saving lives. We are working double time to help injured survivors, keep them safe from Covid-19 and provide relief to the thousands who have been displaced from their homes,"" he added.  The quake's epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and it had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres, the United States Geological Survey said.  ""The wall of my house collapsed,"" said Hanafi, a 47-year-old who lives in nearby Majene, which also suffered damage and casualties.  ""The refrigerator, the cupboard all tumbled onto the floor.""  Images supplied by the search-and-rescue agency showed rescue workers checking on two young girls who were trapped under the rubble of one structure.   Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.   In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.   On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.  bur-pb/rma/reb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

""In keeping with my campaign promise, my administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room,"" Biden said in a statement issued less than three months before midterm congressional elections, where the issue is seen as a vote winner for Democrats.  The proposed debt relief falls far short of some Democrats' goal of securing complete forgiveness, but is opposed by Republicans who argue that shaving any amount from graduates' loans is unfair to those who have spent years saving to pay off their own debts.  US colleges can often cost anywhere between $10,000 and $70,000 a year, leaving graduates with crushing debt as they enter the workforce. According to government estimates, the average debt for US college students when they graduate is $25,000, a sum many spend years or even decades to pay back.  In total, some 45 million borrowers nationwide owe a collective $1.6 trillion, according to the White House.  Under the relief plan, $10,000 will be cut from all loans owed by people earning a salary of less than $125,000. For former students who went to university with need-based government assistance known as Pell grants, the relief will be $20,000.    - 'Giant step forward' -    Meanwhile, a moratorium on loan repayments that was instituted during the Covid pandemic will be extended to the end of the year, with installments restarting on December 31.  The plan was announced after months of consideration in the White House on how to thread the needle on an issue that has bedeviled successive administrations. Among the worries is that the program will feed already rampant inflation in the wake of the Covid-19 shutdown and subsequent economic recovery.  But Biden has been under heavy pressure for months from the senior Senate Democrat, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and lawmakers from the left of the party to take action.  ""With the flick of a pen, President Biden has taken a giant step forward in addressing the student debt crisis by cancelling significant amounts of student debt for millions of borrowers. The positive impacts of this move will be felt by families across the country, particularly in minority communities,"" said a joint statement by Schumer and leading liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren.  Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel called the plan a ""bailout for the wealthy. As hardworking Americans struggle with soaring costs and a recession, Biden is giving a handout to the rich.""  ""Biden's bailout unfairly punishes Americans who saved for college or made a different career choice, and voters see right through this short-sighted, poorly veiled vote-buy,"" she said.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112811646']

Instead the world watched in shock and horror on Wednesday as a mob of Donald Trump supporters, encouraged by the president, stormed the US Capitol in a bid to thwart lawmakers from their constitutional duty.  Here's how a day of unprecedented chaos unfolded in Washington.    - Trump speaks -    Shortly after 11 am Trump took the stage at a rally at the Ellipse park, south of the White House fence, to address thousands of cheering supporters wearing ""Make America Great Again"" gear and tell them he would ""never concede.""  He repeated calls for his loyal Vice President Mike Pence, set to preside over the events in Congress, to refuse to certify Biden's win.  A number of Republican congressmen had already vowed to object to the certification, but they were outnumbered, making Pence -- as Trump and his supporters saw it -- the last line of defense.  ""Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country,"" Trump told the crowd, promising he would ""be there with you"" as they marched on Congress.    - Pence rebuffs the president -    But even as he was speaking on stage Pence, who has no authority to do as Trump was asking, issued a statement publicly defying his boss for the first time in four years.  ""The Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,"" Pence said.    - Congress begins certifying Biden's win -    Moments later Pence launched the Congressional proceedings, with television networks showing extraordinary split screens of the vice president beginning to certify Biden's victory inside the Capitol as the president, still on stage in the park, continued to rail against it.   Before the president finished talking, however, his supporters had begun to drift away -- headed for the Capitol.    - Trump supporters storm Capitol -    Inside, Arizona had become the first state to object to the certification, forcing a debate. Top Republican senator Mitch McConnell was warning of a democratic ""death spiral"" if Biden's win was overturned.  The first sign of trouble came as some Congressional offices were evacuated with pro-Trump protesters demonstrating outside. Shortly after, the mob began storming the Capitol itself.   Thousands descended on the building. Photos emerged of Capitol police with guns drawn at the door of the debating chamber as terrified lawmakers took cover under chairs and camouflaged protesters smashed windows, and Washington's mayor ordered a nighttime curfew.     - Pence, others call for calm -    Trump tweeted a call for the mob to ""stay peaceful."" Minutes later the first reports of one person being shot and wounded inside the US Capitol emerged. The victim, a woman, died several hours later.  Pence, also on Twitter, issued his own -- much more forceful -- call for the violence to ""stop now."" Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle as well as foreign leaders watching in horror began following suit.     - Biden takes the stage -    With the president holding back from forcefully condemning the violence it was his successor, Joe Biden, who was the first to go on television and brand it an ""insurrection.""  ""I call on President Trump to go on national television now to... demand an end to this siege,"" the veteran Democrat said in Wilmington, Delaware.   ""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, the floor of the United States Senate... threatening the safety of duly elected officials? It's not a protest, it's insurrection.""    - Trump to protesters: 'We love you' -    Minutes after Biden spoke, Trump tweeted a video in which he told supporters to ""go home"" -- but repeated his incendiary claim the election was ""stolen"" and told them ""We love you.""  ""I know your pain,"" Trump said in a one-minute video on Twitter. """"We had an election that was stolen from us.  ""But you have to go home now,"" he said. ""We have to have peace. We have to have law and order.""  Inside the Capitol more photos were emerging of rioters inside the debating chamber, occupying the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, posing for selfies and carrying away souvenirs.     - Riot police push mob back -    But -- as Facebook and Twitter began limiting and removing both Trump's posts and other posts stoking violence -- police in riot gear and backed by the National Guard set up a perimeter around the Capitol building.  Using more tear gas they finally began to push the mob back.   As the 6:00 pm curfew began, thousands were still surrounding the grounds and streets outside the Capitol.    - Congress vows to resume -    US media quoted the sergeants-at-arms of the House of Representatives and the Senate as saying the Capitol was finally secure about four hours after it first came under attack.  House Speaker Pelosi said the Biden win certification would resume ""tonight,"" once the Capitol was secure.   The senior lawmaker blasted the storming of the Capitol as a ""shameful assault"" but said ""it cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden.""  Shortly after 8:00 pm, lawmakers resumed their task.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104705419']

Flight tracking data showed the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport.  Sixty-two passengers and crew were on board, including 10 children, the nation's transport minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, told reporters.  The suspected crash site is near tourist islands just off the coast of Indonesia's sprawling capital.  Sriwijaya Air flight SJ182 was bound for Pontianak on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  Distraught relatives waited nervously for news at the city's airport.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and my three children,"" Yaman Zai said as he sobbed.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby today...How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  The plane took off on Saturday afternoon and a search and rescue operation began with no official results available on Saturday night.  ""We deployed our team, boats and sea riders to the location suspected to be where it went down after losing contact,"" Bambang Suryo Aji, a senior official at the search-and-rescue agency, told reporters after nightfall.    - Sudden plunge -    Data from FlightRadar24 said the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  ""Sriwijaya Air flight #SJ182 lost more than 10,000 feet of altitude in less than one minute, about 4 minutes after departure from Jakarta,"" the tracking agency said on its official Twitter account.  Broadcaster Kompas TV quoted local fishermen as saying they had found debris near islands just off the coast of the capital Jakarta, but it could not be immediately confirmed as having belonged to the missing jet.  Authorities and the airline gave no immediate indication as to why the plane suddenly went down.  The budget airline, which has about 19 Boeing jets that fly to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and a subsequent fatal flight in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  The Boeing jet thought to have crashed Saturday is not a MAX model.  ""We are aware of media reports from Jakarta, and are closely monitoring the situation,"" the US-based planemaker said in a statement.  ""We are working to gather more information.""  Indonesia's aviation sector has long suffered from a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane crashed with the loss of 162 lives.   Domestic investigators' final report on the AirAsia crash showed a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance and the pilots' inadequate response were major factors in what was supposed to be a routine flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.  A year later, in 2015, more than 140 people, including people on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/jfx   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

Here is a summary of what we know:    - Accident or attack? -  Russia said the air base was not targeted by an attack, but new satellite images from Wednesday appear to contradict that.  The images show the base was ""hit with something"" and at least nine planes were destroyed, according to analyst Oliver Alexander.  ""If it was an accident, it would have required 4-5 people throwing cigarettes on the same spot or hitting bombs with a hammer -- incredibly unlikely,"" Alexander told AFP.  The exact cause of the explosions -- special forces sabotage or missile strike -- is still unclear, he said.  Eliot Higgins, a founder of the investigative journalism group Bellingcat, said the images showed three craters and evidence of ""a massive fire across the base"".  ""One way to interpret those craters is precise strikes from a long range munition,"" he wrote on Twittter.    - Strategic target -  Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 in the wake of massive nationwide street demonstrations that led to the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president.  Those protests precipitated fighting between the army and Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, which would lay the groundwork for Moscow's full-scale assault on February 24 this year.  Russia has used the peninsula as a major base to attack Ukraine. But Crimea has rarely been targeted, and this would represent an escalation in the war.  ""I can't think of a time Russia has lost this many air assets in one day in recent memory, and they have to be deeply concerned about Ukraine's ability to do similar strikes elsewhere, especially the Kerch Strait Bridge,"" Higgins said.    - Holidaymakers forced to flee -   The Kerch Strait Bridge, linking Crimea to Russia, was full of traffic jams on Tuesday, video on social media showed.  Hundreds of holidaymakers were also seen fleeing a local beach in the popular tourist destination -- with large plumes of smoke rising over the horizon.  Crimea's Moscow-appointed governor Sergei Aksyonov attempted to reassure holidaymakers in a video statement saying, ""All necessary measures have been tightened to ensure the safety of infrastructure facilities and the population.""    - Ukraine behind the attack? -  Ukrainian officials cited anonymously by the New York Times and Washington Post have said Ukraine was behind the blasts but there has been no public acknowledgement by Kyiv's forces.  Ukraine's military has sarcastically commented on Russia's ""technical difficulties"", saying they may have been caused by smokers in unauthorised areas.  On Wednesday morning, Mykhaylo Podolyak, Adviser to the Head of the Ukranian Presidency, tweeted that ""the epidemic of technical accidents at military airfields in Crimea and Belarus should be considered by Russian military as a warning"".  ""Forget about Ukraine, take off the uniform and leave.... Karma finds you anywhere,"" he continued.  In his nightly address following the attack, President Volodymyr Zelensky did not directly mention the blasts but said ""Crimea is Ukrainian"" and the ""Russian war against Ukraine and against all of free Europe started with Crimea and should end with Crimea, by its liberation.""  brw/dt/bp   THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

The US Treasury announced sanctions on Putin associate and billionaire Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev, who owns the Witanhurst estate, the second-largest estate in London after Buckingham Palace.   Guryev is the founder and former deputy chairman of PhosAgro, a major supplier to global fertilizer markets.  He and his son were hit with financial sanctions, which ban US businesses -- including banks with US branches -- from transactions with them, and freeze their assets under US jurisdictions.  The Treasury also blacklisted Guryev's Caribbean-based 81-meter (267 feet) yacht Alfa Nero, which puts it at risk of seizure.  However, the Treasury said Alfa Nero ""has reportedly shut off its location tracking hardware in order to avoid seizure.""  The Treasury also imposed sanctions on Alina Kabaeva, a former Olympic gymnast widely described as Putin's girlfriend, and Natalya Popova, the wife of Kirill Dmitriev, the manager of the Russian government's massive sovereign wealth fund.   The Treasury said Popova works for the technology firm Innopraktika, which is run by one of Putin's daughters.  ""As innocent people suffer from Russia's illegal war of aggression, Putin's allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.   ""The Treasury Department will use every tool at our disposal to make sure that Russian elites and the Kremlin's enablers are held accountable for their complicity in a war that has cost countless lives,"" Yellen said.  Viktor Filippovich Rashnikov, one of Russia's largest taxpayers, and two subsidiaries of his MMK, which is among the world's largest steel producers, also were hit with sanctions.  In a joint action, the State Department imposed sanctions, including visa restrictions, on oligarchs ""running massive revenue-generating companies,"" including Dmitry Aleksandrovich Pumpyanskiy, Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko and Alexander Anatolevich Ponomarenko.   In addition, nearly 900 Russian officials were placed on a US visa ban list, as were 31 unnamed non-Russian officials who have supported Russia's occupation of Crimea, the State Department said.

Police had failed to stop the underground event, which drew around 2,5000 people from Thursday night in two disused warehouses in Lieuron, south of the city of Rennes in Brittany.  Such mass gatherings are banned across France to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and a nationwide 8 pm curfew -- which was not lifted for New Year -- applies across the country.   Techno music had blared out during the night from the warehouses, which had been transformed into illegal nightclubs for partygoers who had flocked to the site from across France and even from abroad.  The local prefecture said Saturday the music had been switched off and sound systems dismantled after two nights, and the first revellers began leaving the site before dawn.  By 10:15 am it was under the control of police, the local prefecture said.  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a tweet that police had booked more than 1,200 people and seized a truck, sound equipment and generators from the site of the ""illegal raveparty.""  He said the large police presence at the site had led to the breakup of the event ""without violence"".  The regional prefect, Emmanuel Berthier, said 800 people had been booked for failing to respect the curfew restrictions or wear masks or for participating in an illegal assembly.  He told a press conference that police fined several hundred others for use of narcotics.  Police on access roads were checking all those leaving the site, on foot or in vehicles, using torches to check their eyes for signs of drugs use, an AFP photographer said.    - 'Fierce hostility' -    Police reinforcements continued to arrive and close off the site in a calm atmosphere Saturday morning, the photographer said.  French authorities have been worried about mass rave parties throughout the pandemic, but New Year's Eve was a particular concern.  On Thursday night the police had tried to ""prevent the event but faced fierce hostility from many partygoers"" who set one of their cars on fire and threw bottles and stones, the prefecture said Friday.  First aid workers had distributed hand gel and masks at the event to try and limit the spread of the coronavirus.  The regional health authority in Brittany noted the ""high risk of the spread of Covid-19"" at the event, and called on those who took part to undergo coronavirus tests and self-isolate immediately for seven days.  The prefecture said in a tweet that a testing centre had been set up in a gymnasium in Lieuron.  ""They have put their lives in danger, their health, they must now protect those around them,"" it said.  The French government, facing the threat of a new wave of Covid-19 infections, announced on Friday it was bringing forward its nighttime curfew by two hours in 15 regions to help combat the virus.  The country recorded around 20,000 new cases and 133 deaths on Friday, bringing the total number of fatalities to almost 64,800.  lg-gvy-cbo/lp/wdb/dl   Twitter",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104641253']

Dramatic amateur footage shared on social media appeared to show panicked holidaymakers fleeing a Crimean beach with young children, as ballooning clouds of grey smoke rose over the horizon.  The blasts rocked the Saki airfield on the 167th day of Moscow's invasion.  Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and has used the region as a staging ground for its attacks on Ukraine, but it has rarely been a target for Ukrainian forces.  The Russian defence ministry said ""several aviation munitions detonated"" at the base in an incident the head of the region said had left one person dead.   Local health officials earlier said five people, including one child, had been injured.  The defence ministry said it was looking to establish the reason for the explosions but indicated the airfield was not targeted in an attack.  There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv.  Ukraine's army, which for months pleaded for long-range artillery from Western allies, has been hitting targets deeper in Russian-held territory since some started arriving in recent weeks.   Kyiv has also taken credit for several acts of sabotage inside Russian-held territory.  Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine in the wake of massive nationwide street demonstrations that led to the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president.  Those protests precipitated fighting between the army and Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, which would lay the groundwork for Moscow's full-scale assault on February 24 this year.  The invasion has left thousands dead, forced millions in Ukraine from their homes, and littered the country with land mines.  On Tuesday, the United States announced that it will provide $89 million for demining efforts in Ukraine.  ""Russia's unlawful and unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine has littered massive swaths of the country with landmines, unexploded ordnance, and improvised explosive devices,"" the State Department said in a statement.  ""These explosive hazards block access to fertile farmland, delay reconstruction efforts, prevent displaced communities from returning to their homes, and continue to kill and maim innocent Ukrainian civilians,"" it said.     - Mandatory evacuations -    The Russian invasion has led to a deep rupture in economic ties between Moscow and the West.  In response to sanctions for the invasion, Russia has squeezed gas supplies to Europe.  It announced on Tuesday that its oil deliveries through Ukraine had been halted.  Transneft, the Russian pipeline operator, said the Ukrainian side had stopped flows because it was ""not receiving funds for these services"".  The Ukrainian side did not comment.  One of the impacted countries, Slovakia, confirmed flows had been halted for several days, and a spokesman for Bratislava refinery Slovnaft cited ""technical problems at the bank level in connection with the payment of transit fees from the Russian side"".  The Kremlin lashed out after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview that Europe should close their borders to Russians in response to the war.   The Ukrainian leader told The Washington Post that current Western sanctions against Moscow were too weak, in a call that has been echoed by Russia's neighbours Estonia and Finland.  ""The irrationality of thinking in this case is off the charts,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.  On the frontlines, Ukraine said Russia was pursuing a campaign of bombardment of the east of the country that has left much of the industrial Donbas region in ruins.  Kyiv said Tuesday it had transported at least 3,000 people out of the battle-scarred eastern region of Donetsk since it ordered evacuations ahead of winter.   The Ukrainian authorities are asking people to leave the area, as they do not expect to be able to provide it with heat during the cold winter months.  The presidency earlier said that three people had been killed and 19 more wounded in Russian shelling across the Donetsk region on Monday.  The head of the central region of Dnipro, meanwhile, said that 11 medical facilities had relocated there from the battle-torn Kharkiv and Lugansk regions further east.  ""Those facilities transferred over 100 pieces of equipment and 10 ambulances,"" Dnipro regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.  ""The hospitals are restarting work. They are mostly receiving displaced people.""  bur-jbr/wd/md",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

Police said a male suspect stormed the stage and attacked Rushdie and an interviewer, with the writer suffering ""an apparent stab wound to the neck.""  Rushdie was rushed by helicopter to hospital and taken into surgery, his agent Andrew Wylie said in a statement on Twitter, pledging to provide an update on his condition as soon as possible.  Social media footage showed people administrating emergency medical care onstage immediately after the attack. The interviewer also suffered a head injury.  A suspect was taken into custody by state police, who gave no immediate details about his identity or probable motive.   The attack occurred as Rushdie was about to give a speech at the Chautauqua Institution, which holds arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo city.  New York governor Kathy Hochul condemned the stabbing and hailed Rushdie as ""an individual who has spent decades speaking truth to power.""  ""We condemn all violence, and we want people to be able to feel (the) freedom to speak and to write truth,"" she said.    - A decade in hiding -    Rushdie, 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" brought attention beyond his imagination when it sparked a fatwa, or religious decree, calling for his death by Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of the Prophet Mohammed.  Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practicing Muslims and today identifies as an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head -- which remains today.  He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell his children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.    - An 'essential voice' -    Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"" -- which runs to more than 600 pages -- has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  ""Just hours before the attack, on Friday morning, Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face,"" Nossel said in a statement.   ""Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman, wishing him a full and speedy recovery. We hope and believe fervently that his essential voice cannot and will not be silenced.""  Chuck Schumer, a senator representing New York, called the assault ""an attack on freedom of speech and thought, which are two bedrock values of our country.""  ""I hope Mr. Rushdie quickly and fully recovers and the perpetrator experiences full accountability and justice,"" he said.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

The blaze, blamed on an electrical fault, hit the Abu Sifin church in densely populated Imbaba, a working class district west of the Nile River, part of Giza governorate in greater Cairo.   Witnesses described people rushing into the multi-storey house of worship to rescue those trapped but the rescuers were soon overwhelmed by heat and deadly smoke.   ""Everyone was carrying kids out of the building,"" said Ahmed Reda Baioumy, who lives next to the church. ""But the fire was getting bigger and you could only go in once or you would asphyxiate.""  Another witness, Sayed Tawfik, told AFP that ""some threw themselves out of windows to escape the fire."" He pointed to a car bearing dents ""left by a person who is now lying in the hospital with a broken arm and back.""  A resident of the area, Mina Masry, said emergency services were slow in responding. Ambulances took ""over an hour to arrive"" and fire trucks ""nearly an hour, though their station is five minutes away.""  Masry added: ""If the ambulances had come on time, they could have rescued people.""   The Egyptian Coptic Church and the health ministry reported 41 dead and 14 injured in the blaze before emergency services said they had brought the blaze under control.  A statement from the public prosecution service indicated that asphyxiation caused the deaths, as there were ""no visible injuries"".   Copts are the largest Christian community in the Middle East, making up at least 10 million of Egypt's 103 million Muslim-majority population.    - Power surge -    The interior ministry said ""forensic evidence revealed that the blaze broke out in an air-conditioning unit on the second floor of the church building"" which also houses social services.  Father Farid Fahmy, of another nearby church, told AFP a short circuit caused the fire.  ""The power was out and they were using a generator,"" he said. ""When the power came back, it caused an overload.""  In the morning, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on his Facebook page that he had ""mobilised all state services"" in response. He later said he had ""presented his condolences by phone"" to Pope Tawadros II, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church.  He also directed the Armed Forces Engineering Authority to ""take over the reconstruction and renovation"" of the church, the presidency said in a statement.  Christian communities often complain that reconstruction of churches after devastating fires is marked by long delays and bureaucratic hurdles.  Giza's governor ordered ""urgent aid of 50,000 pounds (around $2,600) for the families of the deceased and 10,000 pounds for the injured"".  The grand imam of Al-Azhar, Egypt's foremost Muslim institution, expressed his condolences for ""the tragic accident"" and affirmed ""the readiness of Al-Azhar hospitals to receive the injured"".  Accidental fires are not uncommon in the sprawling megalopolis of Cairo, where millions live in informal settlements.   Baioumy, the neighbour, told AFP that firefighters were hampered by the church's location ""on a very narrow street"".  Egypt, with its often dilapidated and poorly maintained infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.    - Religious minority -    The Coptic minority has endured attacks and complained of discrimination in the north African country, the Arab world's most populous.  Copts have been targeted in deadly attacks by Islamist militants, particularly after Sisi overthrew former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, with churches, schools and homes burnt down.   Copts also complain they have been left out of key state positions and they have deplored restrictive legislation for the construction and renovation of churches.   Sisi, the first Egyptian president to attend the Coptic Christmas mass every year, in February appointed the first ever Coptic judge to head the Supreme Constitutional Court, the country's highest.  sar/sbh/bha/fz/it   Meta",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113514635']

Demonstrators gathered at Moscow's central Pushkin Square and nearby streets despite a heavy police presence and detentions, holding signs that read ""Russia will be free"" and chanting ""Putin is a thief.""  Some then marched towards the Kremlin, while others blocked Tverskaya Street, the Russian capital's main thoroughfare.  Navalny, 44, called on his allies to take to the streets after he was detained in a Moscow airport last weekend. He was arrested moments after arriving from Germany, where he had been flown in August to recover from a near-fatal poisoning with the Soviet-designed nerve agent Novichok.  Moscow police, which the opposition says downplays turnout at anti-government demonstrations, reported that around 4,000 people had gathered in the centre of the capital.  AFP journalists saw protesters throw snowballs at heavily armed riot police, who responded by drawing their batons on the demonstrators.   Police detained nearly 400 people in cities in the Far East, Siberia and the Urals earlier Saturday where demonstrators braved icy temperatures and official warnings, said OVD Info, which tracks opposition arrests.

Thierry Breton, Brussels' top official for the EU internal market, told MEPs that Facebook had been wrong to kick Australian media off its service in a row about paying for news.  Separately, US tech titan Microsoft joined European media in calling for EU members states to follow Australia in setting up a mechanism to ensure that news publishers are paid.  Last week Facebook blanked out the pages of media outlets for Australian users and blocked them from sharing any news content, rather than submit to the proposed legislation.  The European Union has also passed a rule requiring Internet ""gatekeepers"" like Google or Facebook to negotiate fees for including news stories and links.  But the news industry wants the upcoming Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act to include tougher regulations to strengthen its position against the dominant platforms.

The fire broke out around 1:00 am (1800 GMT Thursday) at the Mountain B nightspot in Chonburi province's Sattahip district, about 150 kilometres (90 miles) southeast of Bangkok.  Video footage posted by a rescue service showed desperate revellers fleeing the club screaming, their clothes ablaze, as a huge fire raged in the background.  The Sawang Rojanathammasathan Rescue Foundation said 13 people were killed and more than 40 injured, 14 of them seriously.  The service said the blaze was accelerated by flammable acoustic foam on the walls of the club, and it took firefighters more than three hours to bring it under control.  Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha offered condolences to the victims' families and said he had ordered a probe into the fire.  The dead -- four women and nine men -- were found mostly crowded by the entrance and in the bathroom, their bodies severely burned, the service said.   They were aged between 17 and 49 and all are believed to have been Thai.  ""There is not death related to foreigners,"" police lieutenant colonel Boonsong Yingyong of the Phlu Ta Luang police station, which oversees the area where the blaze occurred, told AFP by phone.    - Charred wreck -    One of the victims was the singer of the band playing at the club, his mother told local media.  ""I don't know what to say. The death came all of a sudden,"" Premjai Sae-Oung told reporters.  She said a musician friend who managed to escape had told her the fire broke out in front of the band and spread rapidly.  Images of the aftermath showed how the fire had turned the inside of the club into a blackened wreck, with the charred metal frames of furniture scattered among ashes.   Engineers are inspecting the one-storey building amid fears it could collapse.  Interior minister Anupong Paochinda told reporters it appeared the Mountain B was operating ""without permission"" to run as an entertainment venue.  Concerns have long been raised about Thailand's lax approach to health and safety regulations, particularly in its countless bars and nightclubs.  A massive inferno erupted at a New Year's Eve party at Bangkok's swanky Santika club in 2009, killing 67 people and injuring more than 200.  The Santika owner was jailed for three years over the blaze, which began when fireworks were let off as a rock band called Burn played on stage.  More recently, four people were killed in a fire caused by an electrical fault at a club on the holiday island of Phuket, a magnet for foreign tourists, in 2012.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113449657']

""This is where your favourite programme was supposed to be,"" read a white message on a black background on the TVN24 news channel.  In a statement to AFP, the channel, owned by the US group Discovery, said the government proposal had ""the intention of restricting their pluralism and freedom of expression"".  The front pages of dozens of national newspapers including the most widely read dailies Fakt and Gazeta Wyborcza had a message in white on a black background reading ""Media Without Choice"".  Their websites were also blacked out.  Radio stations also suspended service, with Radio Zet informing its listeners that the tax would mean ""liquidation for some media businesses"".  ""There is no free country without independent media. There is no freedom without freedom of choice,"" the radio station said.  The new tax, which is expected to take effect later this year, imposes a levy on advertising revenues of television and radio broadcasters, print outlets and internet media companies.  State media are exempt from the tax.  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said the tax is part of Europe-wide efforts to tax global tech giants like Google or Facebook but many independent media outlets say they would be unfairly targeted too.  Morawiecki has said it is a ""solidarity fee"" that will ""create better conditions for the development of free media"" and help fund public healthcare and the culture sector.  But the tax comes at a time when many media companies are already hit by shrinking advertising income and a loss of revenue from other business because of the pandemic.  dt/mas/jxb   DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105427021']

Militants from Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab stormed the Hayat Hotel in the Somali capital on Friday evening, setting off bombs and firing indiscriminately before claiming to take control of the building.  Scores of people were trapped when the assault began and although officials said dozens had been rescued, including children, it is not known how many remain inside.  Sporadic gunfire and explosions could be heard as darkness fell, with reports that police had moved into the building and that there was widespread damage throughout.  Details remain difficult to verify in the chaos and a wide security cordon has been thrown up around the hotel area, with roads blocked off.  The government has yet to make any public comment on the attack, the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June after months of political instability.  Al-Shabaab, which has been waging a deadly insurgency for 15 years against the fragile government in the Horn of Africa nation, has claimed responsibility.   Security commander Mohamed Abdikadir told AFP that the number of civilians confirmed to have died was 13, while police officer Ibrahim Duale said more than 10 had been killed.  ""The security forces rescued dozens of civilians including children who were trapped in the building,"" said Abdikadir.  The director of Mogadishu's main trauma hospital, Mohamed Abdirahman Jama, said it was treating at least 40 people wounded in the hotel attack and a separate mortar strike on another area of the capital.    - Children found hiding in toilet -     One woman, Hayat Ali, said three young relatives aged between four and seven were found by security forces hiding in a hotel toilet in a state of shock but were later reunited with their family.  Another survivor told AFP he and some colleagues had performed evening prayers before taking tea in one of the hotel's open spaces when they heard the first explosions.  ""I managed to run to a nearby exit gate away from the gunmen,"" Hussein Ali told AFP. ""The gunmen started firing and I could hear the shots behind me, but thanks to God... we managed to escape.  ""Those who preferred to take cover inside the building including one of my colleagues died,"" he added.   Somalia's allies including the United States, Britain and Turkey as well as regional grouping IGAD have strongly condemned the attack, with the US embassy saying it pledged ""continued support for Somalia to hold murderers accountable & build when others destroy"".  In another incident, a volley of mortar shells hit the seafront neighbourhood of Hamar Jajab, district commissioner Mucawiye Muddey told AFP.  ""Among those critically wounded are a newlywed bride and her groom and a family of three children, a mother and their father,"" he said.  Witnesses had reported at least two powerful explosions on Friday as gunmen burst into the hotel, a popular spot for local officials and lawmakers.  Police said the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with other gunmen.  Witnesses said a second explosion occurred just minutes later, inflicting more casualties as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to the scene.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces were still in control of the building and that they had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  The jihadists have carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopia border, raising concerns about a possible new strategy.  Earlier this week, the United States announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - Decades of chaos -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Al-Shabaab was driven out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force, but still controls swathes of countryside and continues to launch deadly strikes on political, civilian and military targets, with popular hotels and restaurants often hit.  Earlier this month, new Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre announced the appointment of the group's former deputy leader and spokesman, Muktar Robow, as religion minister.  Robow, 53, defected from Al-Shabaab in 2017, with the US government at one point offering a $5 million bounty for his capture.  Somalia has been mired in chaos since the fall of president Siad Barre's military regime in 1991.  His ouster was followed by a civil war and the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in a bustling commercial district of Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  As well as the insurgency, Somalia is also in the grip of a devastating drought that has driven one million people from their homes and left the country in the shadow of famine, according to the United Nations.  nur-txw/jj",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

The announcement came as divers pulled body parts, wreckage and clothing from waters off Indonesia's capital Jakarta.  ""We have located the position of the black boxes, both of them,"" said Soerjanto Tjahjanto, head of Indonesia's transport safety agency.  ""Divers will start looking for them now and hopefully it won't be long before we get them.""  The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 went into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport in Jakarta on Saturday afternoon.  Indonesia's President Joko Widodo expressed his ""deep condolences"", and called on citizens to ""pray together so that victims can be found"".  But the frantic search involving helicopters and a flotilla of warships appeared to offer no hope of finding any survivors.  The search and rescue agency said it had so far collected five body bags with human remains as well as debris from the crash site in the Java Sea.  A piece of child's clothing, a broken tyre and wheel, life jackets and wreckage from the plane's body were found, according to authorities and AFP reporters on the scene.  Among the passengers was Beben Sofian, 59, and her husband Dan Razanah, 58.  ""They took a selfie and sent it to their kids before taking off,"" the couple's nephew Hendra told AFP.  All 62 people on board, passengers and crew, were Indonesian, authorities said. The count included 10 children.    - 'Torn into pieces' -    Distraught relatives waited nervously for news at the airport in Pontianak, the city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island which had been flight SJ182's destination, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and three children,"" Yaman Zai said on Saturday evening as he sobbed.  ""(My wife) sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""  Data from FlightRadar24 indicated that the airliner reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  The transport minister said Saturday that the jet appeared to deviate from its intended course just before it disappeared from radar.  Poor weather, pilot error or a technical problem with the plane were potential factors, said Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman.  ""But it's way too early to conclude anything,"" he added.  ""After the black box is found we can start putting the puzzle together.""  Sriwijaya Air, which operates flights to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  It did not immediately comment when contacted by AFP again on Sunday.    - Reputation for poor safety -    In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.  That crash -- and another in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  The 26-year-old 737 that went down Saturday was not a MAX variant.  ""Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families,"" Boeing said in a statement, adding that it was in contact with the airline.  Indonesia's aviation sector has long had a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.  Domestic investigators' final report on that crash said major factors included a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance, and the pilots' inadequate response.  A year later, in 2015, more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.  bur-pb/leg   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

The British author was stabbed approximately 10 times, prosecutors said during an arraignment of the New Jersey man, according to the New York Times.   The assault on Rushdie, author of ""The Satanic Verses"" and ""Midnight's Children"", triggered international outrage but drew applause from Islamist hardliners in Iran and Pakistan.  Rushdie, who lived in hiding for years after Iran's first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his killing, underwent emergency surgery and was placed on a ventilator in a Pennsylvania hospital following Friday's assault.   He will likely lose an eye, according to his agent, Andrew Wylie, who said Saturday the author had started to talk again, according to the Times.  President Joe Biden on Saturday called it a ""vicious"" attack and offered prayers for Rushdie's recovery.  ""Salman Rushdie -- with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced -- stands for essential, universal ideals. Truth. Courage. Resilience,"" Biden said in a statement.  The 24-year-old alleged assailant, Hadi Matar, rushed onstage on Friday where Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture and stabbed him in multiple places, including the face, neck and abdomen.  Beyond Rushdie's eye injury, the nerves in one of his arms were severed and his liver was damaged, according to his agent.  Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon, according to the Times.  Police provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.  He appeared in a New York court on Saturday, and pleaded not guilty during his arraignment.    - Effective death sentence -    The 75-year-old novelist had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran's then-supreme leader Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.  The fatwa followed the publication of the novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" which sparked fury among some Muslims who said it was blasphemous for its portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.  In a recent interview with Germany's Stern magazine, Rushdie spoke of how, after so many years living with death threats, his life was ""getting back to normal.""  ""For whatever it was, eight or nine years, it was quite serious,"" he told a Stern correspondent in New York.  ""But ever since I've been living in America, since the year 2000, really there hasn't been a problem in all that time.""  Rushdie moved to New York in the early 2000s and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  Security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community near Buffalo.  Witnesses said Rushdie was seated onstage and preparing to speak when Matar sprang up from the audience and managed to stab him before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators.  Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.  An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there. Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.  Matar was ""born and raised in the US,"" the head of the local municipality, Ali Qassem Tahfa, told AFP.    - Outrage -    ""The Satanic Verses"" and its author remain deeply inflammatory in Iran. When asked by AFP on Saturday, nobody in Tehran's main book market dared to openly condemn the stabbing.  ""I was very happy to hear the news,"" said Mehrab Bigdeli, a man in his 50s studying to become a Muslim cleric.  The message was similar in Iran's conservative media, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""  In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan -- a party that has staged violent protests against what it deems to be anti-Muslim blasphemy -- said Rushdie ""deserved to be killed.""  Elsewhere there was widespread shock and outrage.  British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack ""reprehensible"" and ""cowardly.""  Messages also flooded in from the literary world, with Joyce Carol Oates calling it ""terrible, tragic news"" and Rushdie's close friend Ian McEwan calling him an ""inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world.""  Rushdie was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel, ""Midnight's Children,"" in 1981, which won international praise for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But ""The Satanic Verses"", published in 1988, transformed his life. The resulting fatwa forced him into nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell even his children where he lived.  bur/bbk-sst/bfm/sw/ser   THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

The comments from the incoming administration reflect an unusual area of common ground with outgoing President Donald Trump, who over the past four years unleashed an aggressive and costly trade war that imposed billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on Chinese goods.  Janet Yellen, Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, and Antony Blinken, who was tapped to lead the State Department, nonetheless emphasized areas of difference, particularly the incoming administration's commitments to working with US allies and promoting investments to make American firms and workers more competitive against Beijing.  Responding to questions from the Senate Finance Committee at her confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Yellen called China ""our most important strategic competitor.""  She accused Beijing of ""undercutting American companies"" by offering illegal subsidies, dumping products at below-market prices, stealing intellectual property and erecting barriers to US exports.  ""We need to take on China's abusive unfair and illegal practices,"" she said, adding ""we're prepared to use the full array of tools"" to address those issues.  Speaking the day before Biden is due to take office, she also vowed to be watchful of the national security implications of China's theft of ""trade secrets"" and ""illegal efforts to acquire critical technology.""  Biden's transition team pushed for her ""swift confirmation"" in a statement after her testimony, saying Yellen ""demonstrated that she is the bold, experienced leader needed at the helm of the Treasury to begin building our economy back better.""  Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ""President Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China,"" but added, ""I disagree very much with the way he went about it in a number of areas.""    - Investing in America -    Unlike Trump, who pulled back from multilateral organizations and attacked the trade policies of US partners and adversaries alike, Yellen stressed that it will be important ""to work with our allies"" to combat the challenge posed by China.  Democrats have for years complained bitterly about the exodus of jobs and manufacturing to the Asian country. Trump, a Republican, doubled down on those complaints and won the support of many workers.  In a farewell address Tuesday, the outgoing president defended his record, saying he had brought unprecedented international pressure on Washington's communist rival.  ""We revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before,"" Trump said, according to excerpts released by the White House.  But he in fact consistently acted unilaterally, while both retreating from and crippling the World Trade Organization, which enforces global commerce rules.  Biden, a Democrat, also has pledged to defend American workers and manufacturing, and under his slogan ""Build Back Better"" is expected to soon propose a stimulus plan that includes massive infrastructure investments.  Yellen said that policy would help fend off Beijing's economic challenge.  Washington needs to ""make investments that allow us to compete with China... by investing in our infrastructure, investing in our people and creating a more competitive economy,"" she said.    - Currency manipulation -    Trump, like other administrations before him, also accused China of keeping its currency artificially low as a way to make its products cheaper and gain a trade advantage, and Yellen underscored Washington's opposition to that practice.  The US dollar's value against other currencies ""should be determined by markets,"" Yellen said, while also promising ""to oppose any and all attempts by foreign countries to artificially manipulate currency values to gain an unfair advantage in trade.""

At least 13 civilians have been killed and dozens wounded since militants from the Al-Qaeda affiliate unleashed a gun and bomb attack on the popular Hayat Hotel on Friday evening, according to Somali officials.   ""The security forces have ended the siege now and the gunmen are dead, we've had no incoming gunfire from the building in the past hour,"" the commander told AFP on condition of anonymity.  He gave no further information about the total number of civilian or security casualties, or how many Al-Shabaab fighters had been killed, saying the government would give a press briefing on Sunday morning.  The building still needed to be cleared of any explosives that may have been planted, he added.  The attack was the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June, and underscored the challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist militant group.  The hotel, a popular spot for government officials, was destroyed after security forces pounded it with heavy weapons late Saturday in a bid to eliminate assailants who were holed up there for a second straight night.  Witnesses watching the drama from the rooftop of another building said they saw flames tear through the hotel during the bombardment by security forces, with heavy explosions and gunfire reported.  Scores of people were trapped when the assault began and although officials said dozens had been rescued, including children, it is not known how many were still inside when the siege ended.  Al-Shabaab, which has carried out numerous deadly attacks in its war against the fragile government in the Horn of Africa nation, has claimed responsibility.   Security official Mohamed Abdikadir had told AFP earlier the number of civilians confirmed to have died was 13.  The director of Mogadishu's main trauma hospital, Mohamed Abdirahman Jama, said it was treating at least 40 people wounded in the hotel attack and a separate mortar strike on a seaside area, Hamar Jajab.    - Children found hiding in toilet -     One woman, Hayat Ali, said three children aged between four and seven were found by security forces hiding in a hotel toilet in a state of shock but were later reunited with their family.  Another survivor told AFP he and some colleagues had performed evening prayers before taking tea in one of the hotel's open spaces when they heard the first explosions on Friday, the start of the weekend in the mainly Muslim country.  ""I managed to run to a nearby exit gate away from the gunmen,"" Hussein Ali said. ""The gunmen started firing and I could hear the shots behind me, but thanks to God... we managed to escape.""  Somalia's allies, including the United States, Britain and Turkey, as well as the UN, have strongly condemned the attack. So did ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  ""We express our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost loved ones, wish a full recovery to those injured, and commend Somalia's security forces,"" the US State Department said, while reiterating ""steadfast"" support for the country's counterterrorism efforts.  ATMIS expressed ""solidarity"" with the Somali government, while the UK's embassy in Mogadishu said the country stood ""alongside Somalia as it confronts those who seek to destroy what has been achieved"".  Witnesses had reported at least two powerful explosions on Friday as gunmen burst into the hotel. Police said the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel with other gunmen.  A second explosion occurred just minutes later, witnesses said, inflicting more casualties as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to the scene.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  In a statement by the group's news agency cited by the SITE Intelligence monitoring group, the jihadists claimed to have held hostages during the siege, including government and security officials.    - No negotiations yet -    Al-Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office, and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopian border.  Earlier this week, the United States announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.  Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  Al-Shabaab was driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, but still controls swathes of countryside and is able to launch deadly strikes, with hotels and restaurants often hit.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  nur-txw/jj/smw/lb",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

Hospitals were overrun with hundreds of injured after the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Friday, triggering panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  Rescuers have spent days hauling corpses from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province, where a hospital was flattened and a shopping mall lay in ruins.  Others were killed south of the city.  The official death toll stood at 60 -- up from 46 on Saturday -- but the count could still climb.  Aerial images from the devastated seaside city showed buildings reduced to a tangled mass of twisted metal and chunks of concrete, including the regional governor's office.  It was unclear how many more bodies could be under the debris, or if there was anyone still trapped but alive more than two days after the disaster.  Authorities have not given a figure for how many survivors have been rescued.  A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.  Meanwhile, corpses were recovered from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.    - Running low on food, supplies -    The thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with whole families -- that were lashed by heavy monsoon downpours.  They said they were running low on food, blankets and other aid, as emergency supplies were rushed to the hard-hit region.  Many survivors are unable to return to their destroyed homes, or were too scared to go back fearing a tsunami sparked by aftershocks, which are common after strong earthquakes.  ""It's better to take shelter before something worse happens,"" said Mamuju resident Abdul Wahab, from a makeshift tent with his wife and four kids, including a baby.  ""We hope the government can deliver aid soon like food, medicine and milk for the children,"" he added.  Worried about an outbreak of Covid-19 in the crowded camps, authorities said they are trying to separate high- and lower-risk groups.  ""The situation in Indonesia is urgent,"" said NGO Project HOPE.   ""(But) Covid-19 further complicates emergency response.""    - Disaster-prone -    In neighbouring Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo island, at least five people had died in heavy flooding while dozens more were missing, according to reports, while floods have killed at least five people in Manado, hundreds of kilometres north of the quake disaster in Sulawesi.  Landslides in West Java killed at least 28 this week as the rainy season heaps misery on parts of the sprawling nation.  At the eastern end of Java island, rumbling Mount Semeru erupted late Saturday, shooting a plume of ash and debris some 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) into the sky, as bright red lava flowed down its crater. There were no immediate reports of casualties.  Disaster-prone Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.  In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  And on December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

Washington is becoming increasingly alarmed that the Russian government and businesses are using Turkey to evade Western financial and trade restrictions imposed in response to the six-month-old war.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to step up economic cooperation at a summit in the Black Sea resort of Sochi earlier this month.  Official data show the value of Turkish exports to Russia between May and July growing by nearly 50 percent from last year's figure.  Turkey's imports of Russian oil are ballooning and the two sides have agreed to transition to ruble payments for the natural gas exported by the Kremlin-tied giant Gazprom.  US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo paid a rare visit to Ankara and Istanbul in June to express Washington's worries that Russian oligarchs and big businesses were using Turkish entities to evade Western sanctions.  NATO member Turkey -- on good terms with both Moscow and Kyiv -- has tried to stay neutral in the conflict and refused to join the international sanctions regime.    - 'Risk of US sanctions' -    Adeyemo followed that up with a letter to Turkey's TUSIAD business association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Turkey warning that companies and banks were in danger of being sanctioned themselves.  TUSIAD said in a statement late Tuesday that it had passed on the letter to Turkey's foreign ministry as well as finance and trade officials.  The letter's contents were first reported by The Wall Street Journal this week.  ""Any individuals or entities providing material support to US-designated persons are themselves at risk of US sanctions,"" Adeyemo wrote.  ""Turkish banks cannot expect to establish corresponding relationships with sanctioned Russian banks and retain their corresponding relationships with major global banks as well as access to the US dollar and other major currencies.""  The economic cooperation agreement sealed by Erdogan and Putin includes a deal for more Turkish banks to start processing Russia's Mir payments system.  Broader cooperation with Russia could help support Turkey's ailing economy in the run-up to next year's general election.  Adeyemo raised US concerns again in a phone call to Turkey's Deputy Finance Minister Yunus Elitas last Friday.  ""Underlining that it has deep economic and political relations with Ukraine and Russia, Elitas said that Turkey's position (on joining) the sanctions has not changed,"" Turkey's finance ministry said in a statement about the call.  The finance ministry added that ""it will not allow any institution or individual"" to use Turkey to evade the sanctions regime.  Erdogan has previously argued that Ankara cannot join Western sanctions on Moscow because of Turkey's heavy dependence on Russian oil and natural gas imports.  Some analysts believe that TUSIAD and the American Chamber of Commerce in Turkey -- largely made up of big business with a global reach -- are unlikely to violate the regime because they place more value on open access to US financial markets.  Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management in London told AFP ""smaller, domestically focused"" companies were more likely to strike deals with sanctioned Russian entities that opened the way to two-way trade.  ""It worries me though that the message from the top in Turkey seems to be that it's fine to do more business with Russia, and it's important to try and exploit opportunities to counterbalance costs from sanctions, even prosper from them.""  zak/fo/jj   GAZPROM",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

""I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the US-Israel alliance, to continue expanding peace between Israel and the Arab world and to confront common challenges, chief among them the threat posed by Iran,"" Netanyahu said.  The Israeli leader was speaking in a video congratulating Biden moments after he was sworn in as US president, replacing Donald Trump.  Netanyahu, who has referred to Trump as the ""best friend"" Israel has had in the White House, noted Wednesday that he had ""a warm personal friendship going back many decades"" with Biden.  Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said it was ""not sorry"" to see Trump depart, calling him ""the world's main source and sponsor of oppression, violence and extremism"" and partner in ""Israeli aggression"" against the Palestinians.  Biden ""must correct the wrong historical path of American policy which is oppressing our people,"" and end policies aiming at ""destroying the Palestinian cause"", said Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum.  The Palestinian presidency lashed out at Netanyahu, who on Sunday announced that Israel approved 780 new settler homes in the occupied West Bank, ahead of a March general election.  All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by much of the international community.    - 'Welcoming Biden with settlements' -    But Trump's administration, breaking with decades of US policy, declared in late 2019 that Washington no longer considered settlements as being in breach of international law.  ""Netanyahu is welcoming Biden with settlements,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, on Wednesday.  ""His only aim is to destroy the two-state solution.""  Under Trump, the United States also recognised Jerusalem as Israel's ""undivided"" capital and moved its embassy there, sparking Palestinian outrage.  In his own reaction to Biden's inauguration, Abbas said in a statement that ""we are impatient to work together for the peace and stability of the region and the whole world,"" declaring he was ready to open a peace process that meets the aspirations of the Palestinian people.  Jibril Rajub, a senior official from Abbas' Fatah party, earlier said ""we hope that the presence of Biden will be a chance to apply international law and resolve the conflict, establishing an independent Palestinian state and putting an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people.""  Trump's administration also withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed tough new sanctions on the Islamic republic, Israel's arch foe -- another move welcomed by the Jewish state, which encouraged Europe to follow suit.  But Biden's nominee for Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said Tuesday the incoming administration was ready to return to the deal as long as Iran respects its commitments.  The Jewish state has also reached a series of normalisation agreements with its Arab neighbours under the Trump administration.  gl/par/dwo/dv",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

By a lopsided vote of 81-13, well more than the two-thirds of the 100-member chamber required, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the $740.5 billion National Defense Authorization Act to fund the military for fiscal year 2021.   The Democratic-led House of Representatives had voted 322 to 87 on Monday to override Trump's veto.   Both houses of Congress had easily passed the legislation in early December by strong majorities, but Trump, citing a litany of objections, vetoed it on December 23.  ""It's time for us to deliver this bill,"" Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said at the start of Friday's session.   ""It's our chance to remind brave service members and their families that we have their backs.""  The vote completed a stunning rebuke in the waning weeks of Trump's presidency.   It came in an extraordinary New Year's Day session necessitated by his veto, possibly the final act of the outgoing Congress.   New members will be sworn in on Sunday, just 17 days before Democrat Joe Biden is inaugurated to succeed Trump.    - Trump's complaints -    Breaking with members of his party, Trump had criticized the defense bill on numerous grounds.  He called it a ""gift"" to China and Russia and said it restricted his ability to lower troop numbers in Afghanistan, South Korea and elsewhere.  Trump had bristled at language to rename military installations that currently honor leaders of the breakaway Civil War-era, pro-slavery Confederacy.   He also insisted the bill should include a repeal of a federal law, known as Section 230, that provides liability protection to internet companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, which he regularly accuses of anti-conservative bias.  ""Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies,"" Trump tweeted after the vote. ""Pathetic!!!""  Referring to the Senate's refusal to vote first on a motion to increase pandemic aid checks, he added, ""Now they want to give people ravaged by the China Virus $600, rather than the $2000 which they so desperately need,"" using a term he applies to the coronavirus that has been widely decried as racist and fanning conspiracy theories.  But members of the president's own Republican Party -- which traditionally prides itself as strong on defense -- underscored the importance of the bill.  ""It's absolutely vital to our national security and our troops,"" said Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  ""Our men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform shouldn't be denied what they need -- ever.""  Democrats in both chambers had slammed Trump's veto.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hailed the ""resounding rebuke"" that both houses of Congress delivered by overwhelmingly overriding Trump's veto.  ""Instead of keeping Americans safe, the President continues to use his final moments in office to sow chaos and undermine our security,"" she said in a statement.  Senator Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said Friday on the Senate floor that the bill was ""essential"" in bolstering the nation's cybersecurity against the type of widespread targeted attack that recently hit both the government and some private companies.  As to Trump's remark that Moscow and Beijing might approve of the bill, Reed said that any such suggestion was ""completely baseless.""  On the Senate floor Friday, Inhofe and Reed repeatedly congratulated each other for their months-long collaboration on the sweeping bill -- a rare instance of cross-aisle cooperation in the deeply divided Congress.  bur-acb/to","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55636588', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60528249']"

In a televised address, Biden said the strike in Kabul, Afghanistan had been carried out on Saturday. ""I gave the final approval to go get him,"" he said, adding that there had been no civilian casualties.  ""Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said.  A senior administration official said Zawahiri had been killed on the balcony of a house in Kabul in a drone strike, and that there had been no US boots on the ground in Afghanistan.   The official said that Zawahiri's presence in the Afghan capital Kabul was a ""clear violation"" of a deal the Taliban had signed with the US in Doha in 2020 that paved the way for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.  It was the first known over-the-horizon strike by the United States on an Al-Qaeda target in Afghanistan since American forces withdrew from the country on August 31, 2021.   Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon who grew up in a comfortable Cairo household before turning to violent radicalism, had been on the run for 20 years since the 9/11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in the United States.  He took over Al-Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011, and had a $25 million US bounty on his head.   Over the weekend the Afghan interior ministry denied reports circulating on social media of a drone strike in Kabul, telling AFP a rocket struck ""an empty house"" in the capital, causing no casualties.  Early Tuesday in Kabul, however, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that an ""aerial attack"" was carried out on a residence in the Sherpur area of the city.  ""The nature of the incident was not revealed at first. The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found in their preliminary investigations that the attack was carried out by American drones,"" his tweet said.  In recent months the Taliban have largely barred media from covering the aftermath of security incidents and frequently deny or downplay any casualties.  The news comes a month before the first anniversary of the final withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, leaving the country in the control of the Taliban insurgency that fought Western forces over the preceding two decades.  The US withdrew after the Taliban signed the deal in Doha in 2020 in which they promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for international jihadism, but experts believe the group never broke their ties with Al-Qaeda.    - Doctor turned jihadist    Zawahiri, 71, lacked the potent charisma that helped bin Laden rally jihadists around the world, but willingly channelled his analytical skills into the Al-Qaeda cause.  He was believed to be the main strategist -- the real mastermind who steered operations, including the September 11 attacks, as well as bin Laden's personal doctor.  Zawahiri's father was a renowned physician and his grandfather a prayer leader at Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, the highest authority for Sunni Muslims.  He became involved with Egypt's radical Muslim community at a young age and published several books on Islamic fundamentalism, which came for many to symbolize the radical Islamist movement.  He left Egypt in the mid-1980s and headed for Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar where the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based.  It was at that time, when thousands of Islamist fighters flooded into Afghanistan during the 1980s, that Zawahiri and bin Laden met.  In the early 1990s Zawahiri is believed to have lived in Europe before joining bin Laden in Sudan or Afghanistan.  In 1998 he was one of five signatories to bin Laden's ""fatwa"" calling for attacks against Americans and he began appearing regularly at the Al-Qaeda leader's side.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']

Hadi Matar, 24, was arraigned in court in New York state, with prosecutors outlining how Rushdie had been stabbed approximately 10 times in what they described as a planned, premeditated assault.  After the on-stage attack on Friday, Rushdie had been helicoptered to hospital and underwent emergency surgery.  His agent Andrew Wylie had said the writer was on a ventilator and in danger of losing an eye, but in an update on Saturday he told the New York Times that Rushdie had started to talk again, suggesting his condition had improved.  Author of ""The Satanic Verses"" and ""Midnight's Children"", Rushdie had lived in hiding for years after Iran's first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his killing.   And while Friday's stabbing triggered international outrage, it also drew applause from Islamist hardliners in Iran and Pakistan.  President Joe Biden on Saturday called it a ""vicious"" attack and offered prayers for Rushdie's recovery.  ""Salman Rushdie -- with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced -- stands for essential, universal ideals. Truth. Courage. Resilience,"" Biden said in a statement.  Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon. Police provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.    - Effective death sentence -    The 75-year-old novelist had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran's then-supreme leader Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer.  The fatwa followed the publication of the novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" which enraged some Muslims who said it was blasphemous for its portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.  In a recent interview with Germany's Stern magazine, Rushdie spoke of how, after so many years living with death threats, his life was ""getting back to normal.""  ""For whatever it was, eight or nine years, it was quite serious,"" he told a Stern correspondent in New York.  ""But ever since I've been living in America, since the year 2000, really there hasn't been a problem in all that time.""  Rushdie moved to New York in the early 2000s and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  Security was not particularly tight at Friday's event at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community near Buffalo.  Witnesses said Rushdie was seated on stage and preparing to speak when Matar sprang up from the audience and managed to stab him before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators.  Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.  An AFP reporter who visited the village Saturday was told that Matar's parents were divorced and his father -- a shepherd -- still lived there.   Journalists who approached his father's home were turned away.  Matar was ""born and raised in the US,"" the head of the local municipality, Ali Qassem Tahfa, told AFP.    - Outrage -    ""The Satanic Verses"" and its author remain deeply inflammatory in Iran. When asked by AFP on Saturday, nobody in Tehran's main book market dared to openly condemn the stabbing.  ""I was very happy to hear the news,"" said Mehrab Bigdeli, a man in his 50s studying to become a Muslim cleric.  The message was similar in Iran's conservative media, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""  In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan, a party that has staged violent protests, said Rushdie ""deserved to be killed.""  Elsewhere there was shock and outrage.  British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack ""reprehensible"" and ""cowardly.""  Messages also flooded in from the literary world, with Rushdie's close friend Ian McEwan calling him an ""inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world.""  Rushdie was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel, ""Midnight's Children,"" in 1981, which won international praise for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But ""The Satanic Verses"", published in 1988, transformed his life. The resulting fatwa forced him into nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell even his children where he lived.  bur/bbk-sst/bfm/sw/ser   THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Kansans rejected an amendment that would have scrapped language in the state constitution guaranteeing the right to the procedure and could have paved the way for stricter regulations or a ban.  The vote was widely seen as a test case for abortion rights nationwide, as Republican-dominated legislatures rush to impose strict bans on the procedure following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Results showed that votes in favor of keeping abortion in the state constitution far surpassed the votes against. This reflects that fact that a majority of Americans support abortion access, multiple studies have shown.  When polls closed at 7:00 pm (0000 GMT), Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab said turnout was as high as 50 percent on this referendum, local media reported, a number usually expected for a general election.  Poll worker Marsha Barrett said some 250 voters had come to a station in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe by noon -- the same number it might see all day in a presidential election.   ""This election is crazy,"" Barrett told AFP. ""People are determined to vote.""  Other states including California and Kentucky are set to vote on the hot-button issue in November, at the same time as Congressional midterm elections in which both Republicans and Democrats hope to use it to mobilize their supporters nationwide.  In Kansas, the ballot centered on a 2019 ruling by the state's supreme court that guarantees access to abortion.   In response, the Republican-dominated state legislature introduced an amendment known as ""Value Them Both"" that would have scrapped the constitutional right -- with the stated aim of handing regulation of the procedure back to lawmakers.  In the opposing camp, activists said the campaign was a barely masked bid to clear the way for an outright ban -- one state legislator had already introduced a bill that would ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest or the mother's life.   For Ashley All, spokeswoman for pro-abortion rights campaign Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the amendment would have dealt a blow to ""personal autonomy.""  But voter Sylvia Brantley, 60, said she voted in favor of the change because she believes ""babies matter, too.""  She said she wants to see more regulations, in the hope that ""Kansas will not be a marketplace for killing babies.""  Activists complained that the phrasing of the ballot question was counterintuitive and potentially confusing: voting ""Yes"" to the amendment meant abortion rights would be curbed, while people who wished to keep those rights intact must vote ""No.""     - All eyes on Kansas -    While abortion rights advocates in Kansas could breathe a sigh of relief in their own state, they still are looking nervously to neighboring Oklahoma and Missouri, which are among at least eight states to have passed near-total bans -- the latter making no exceptions for rape or incest -- while Midwestern Indiana adopted its own rigid ban on Saturday.  Voter Chris Ehly, in Prairie Village, said he voted ""no"" because his daughter and wife ""are very adamant about the decision.""  ""I want to respect them,"" he said.   Another Prairie Village voter, who declined to give her name, said she struggled to decide which way to vote.   ""I've gone back and forth the whole time,"" she told AFP, saying she ultimately chose to vote ""no.""  ""I feel like women should have a choice, but I also don't want full-term babies aborted,"" she said.   The outcome in Kansas means that abortion will remain permitted up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.  Kansas leans heavily toward the Republican Party, which favors stricter abortion regulations, but a 2021 survey from Fort Hays State University found that fewer than 20 percent of Kansas respondents agreed that abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest.  caw/to/jta",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113334565']

No casualties have been reported after the late-night quake in the Pacific, which did not trigger a tsunami, and no abnormalities were observed at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant.  But residents preparing to mark the 10th anniversary of the triple disaster said they were frightened by Saturday's jolt -- which the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said was considered an aftershock of the massive tremor on March 11, 2011.  ""I was at home... the shaking was so strong I became truly afraid for my physical safety,"" Masami Nakai, a municipal official in Soma city in northern Fukushima, told AFP.  Images posted online showed a car crushed by a rock lantern in the car park of a Shinto shrine, while another showed broken glass and items thrown from the shelves at a shop.  The disaster agency said 114 injuries -- six classed as ""serious"" -- were reported in the region and also around Tokyo, where the quake was felt strongly just after 11 pm on Saturday.  Authorities were assessing the impact of a landslide on a highway, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said, and aerial TV footage showed another landslide at a remote race circuit.  The government reported partial damage to eight structures, mostly houses, while local media said dozens of buildings had suffered broken ceilings and broken water pipes.  Kato warned residents about the possibility of strong aftershocks in the next week and further landslides due to heavy rain forecast.  ""Particularly for the next two to three days, there might be very strong earthquakes,"" Kato said.    - Socially distanced shelters -    The quake came as Japan attempts to contain the spread of Covid-19 while preparing for the pandemic-postponed Tokyo Olympics, due to start in July.  Kato said that by early Sunday more than 250 people were at 173 emergency shelters in Fukushima and surrounding regions, with social distancing measures in place such as tents for each family. Many may now have returned home, he added.  Pfizer, whose coronavirus vaccine is set to become the first to be approved in Japan on Sunday, told the government that the quake did not affect facilities storing its jabs, Kato said.  The JMA said the earthquake hit at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles). The US Geological Survey registered the quake at a revised magnitude of 7.1 with a depth of 51 kilometres.  It briefly caused around 950,000 homes to lose power, and Kato said water outages were affecting 4,800 households, with self-defence troops heading to affected areas to deliver water.  Tomoko Kobayashi, who works at a traditional inn in Fukushima's Minamisoma city, told Kyodo news agency that ""the initial jolt felt more powerful than the one I experienced in the Great East Japan Earthquake"" of 2011.  Renowned author Yu Miri, who also lives in Minamisoma, tweeted a photo of her home, showing books, potted plants and other belongings strewn across the floor.  Japan sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.  The country is regularly hit by quakes, and has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong tremors.  More than 18,000 people were left dead or missing in the March 2011 natural disaster.  And in September 2018, a 6.6-magnitude quake rocked northern Hokkaido, triggering landslides, collapsing houses and killing more than 40 people.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105477226']

Excavators and cranes were deployed across the devastated seaside city of Mamuju, where buildings were reduced to a tangled mass of twisted metal and chunks of concrete, including a hospital and the regional governor's office.  It was unclear how many people -- dead or alive -- could still be under mountains of debris in the aftermath of Friday's 6.2-magnitude quake.  ""The rain poses risks because damaged buildings could collapse if it gets too heavy...and aftershocks could move them too,"" said rescuer Octavianto.  Excavating debris too fast with heavy equipment could crush and kill any buried survivors, he added.  ""All the victims we've found so far were dead,"" said Octavianto, 37, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.  ""It is most likely any more victims are already dead if 24 hours has passed,"" he added.  Scores of rescuers combed through the destruction, filling body bags with corpses, while police on Sunday deployed a K-9 unit of sniffer dogs to help in the search at a badly damaged hospital.  ""We also use our own sense of smell to find possible victims,"" said rescuer Kustang Firman at the hospital scene.  ""If there's a strong scent (of decay), we'll focus on that spot.""  - 'Roaring sound' -    Most victims were found in Mamuju, but some were also recovered south of the city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province.  Friday's tremor triggered panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.  ""We heard a roaring sound and the house started shaking,"" said survivor Jumardi, 50, from a shelter where he and six family members took refuge.  ""All I had in my mind was that I would die... Everyone was panicking.""  Authorities have not given a figure for how many survivors have been rescued.  A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.  Meanwhile, corpses were recovered from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.  - Running low on food, supplies -    Doctors treated patients with broken limbs and other injuries at a makeshift medical centre, set up outside the only hospital in Mamuju that survived relatively intact.  Wawan, who was buried under his house until neighbours pulled him to freedom, initially didn't want to go into a hospital to treat his broken foot, fearing another quake.  ""I was traumatised,"" the 27-year-old said.  ""But people convinced me that the doctors were treating patients outside the building, so I agreed to go.""  Thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with whole families.  They said they were running low on food, blankets and other aid, as emergency supplies were rushed to the hard-hit region.  Many survivors were unable to return to their destroyed homes, or were too scared to go back, fearing a tsunami sparked by aftershocks, common after strong earthquakes.  ""It's better to take shelter before something worse happens,"" said Mamuju resident Abdul Wahab, from inside a tent with his wife and four children, one of whom is just a baby.  Fearing an outbreak of coronavirus in the crowded camps, authorities were trying to separate high and low risk groups.  - Disaster-prone -    Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of nearly 270 million, has been hit by a series of natural disasters this week.  Landslides sparked by torrential rains killed at least 32 on Java island, while dozens are dead or missing after severe flooding pounded another part of Sulawesi and Kalimantan, Indonesia's section of Borneo.  Volcano Mount Semeru shot a plume of ash and debris some 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles) into the sky Saturday night as bright red lava flowed down from its crater. There were no reports of casualties.  Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.  In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  And on December 26, 2004, a massive 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including 170,000 in Indonesia -- among the worst recorded disasters in history.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104828966']

The deal, due to come into effect at 11:30 pm (2030 GMT) on Sunday, raises hopes of an imminent cessation of the worst fighting in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the impoverished Palestinian coastal territory.  But minutes before the truce was due to come into force, the Israeli army said it was ""striking terror targets"" inside Gaza, while multiple air raid sirens warning of militant rocket attacks sounded in southern Israel.  Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid's office thanked ""Egypt for its efforts"" and confirmed the truce would come into effect, but warned it that ""if the ceasefire is violated, the State of Israel maintains the right to respond strongly.""  Islamic Jihad member Mohammad al-Hindi had earlier confirmed the militants had accepted the truce, but the group added in a statement that it also ""reserves the right to respond"" to any aggression.  Since Friday, Israel has carried out heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of Islamic Jihad positions in Gaza, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets in retaliation.  Buildings in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, while Israelis have been forced to shelter from a barrage of rockets.  In addition to the 43 people killed in Gaza, including 15 children, more than 300 people have been wounded in the Palestinian enclave, which is run by the Islamist group Hamas.  Three people in Israel have been wounded by shrapnel over the same period, while 31 others have been lightly hurt, emergency services said on Sunday.  Islamic Jihad's Hindi said the ceasefire deal ""contains Egypt's commitment to work towards the release of two prisoners"".  The pair were named as Bassem al-Saadi, a senior figure in the group's political wing who was recently arrested in the occupied West Bank, and Khalil Awawdeh, a militant also in Israeli detention.  Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas also welcomed the truce in a statement from his office, thanking the ""tireless efforts"" made by Egypt.  - 'Terrifying' -    Nour Abu Sultan, who lives in the west of Gaza, said earlier Sunday that she was ""awaiting the declaration of the ceasefire on tenterhooks"".  ""We haven't slept for days (due to) heat and shelling and rockets, the sound of aircraft hovering above us... is terrifying,"" the 29-year-old said.  Dalia Harel, a resident in the Israeli town of Sderot close to the Gaza border, said she was ""disappointed"" at news of a truce despite her five children being ""traumatised"".  ""We're tired of having a military operation every year,"" she said. ""We need our military and political leaders to get it over with once and for all... we're not for war, but we can't go on like this.""  An AFP photographer saw two rockets being intercepted in the centre of Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv on Sunday evening.  Two Islamic Jihad rockets earlier in the day had targeted Jerusalem, but they were shot down by the Israeli army.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.  The Israeli army has said the entire ""senior leadership of the military wing of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza has been neutralised"".  Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.  ""Every minute we receive injured people,"" he said earlier Sunday.    - Top militants killed -    The army said it had struck over a hundred Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing hundreds of rockets and mortars, some of them falling short inside Gaza.  Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Gaza's northern Jabalia area on Saturday.  An AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the hospital there, including three minors.  ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   Amid the high tensions, Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.  Some Palestinians shouted ""God is greatest"" in response, and an AFP photographer was briefly detained by Israeli police, but commemorations passed without major incident.  Israel has said it was necessary to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation Friday against Islamic Jihad, which it said was planning an imminent attack.  The army has killed senior leaders of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, including Taysir al-Jabari in Gaza City and Khaled Mansour in Rafah in the south.  bur-pjm/lg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Residents in several suburbs south of Perth have been warned to be on watch as around 150 firefighters battled a blaze which has razed more than 230 hectares since Saturday.  The local emergency department downgraded the fire from earlier ""emergency"" level, but warned there was still ""a possible threat to lives and homes as a fire is burning in the area and conditions are changing"".  It is not known what triggered the fire.  Hazardous and reeking fumes emanating from a burning rubbish tip are also causing concern, with locals told to ""shelter in place for safety"".  Several roads were forced to close and motorists have been told not to travel to the fire-stricken area.  There are other wildfires in and around the Perth metropolitan area too, including one that forced the evacuation of a retirement village on Sunday in the southeast suburb of Gosnells.  About 60 people were moved to safety and an evacuation centre has been set up in the area.   Hot and windy conditions -- pushing 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) -- are forecast for Perth this week.  Western Australia was spared the brunt of last summer's devastating climate change-fuelled wildfires, which mostly ravaged the country's two most populous states New South Wales and Victoria.

Rain and cooler conditions brought some relief to hundreds of firefighters battling to protect the 8,000-person town of Yreka, but the human cost of the inferno was already mounting.  ""We have four fatalities confirmed, and that number could change,"" Siskiyou County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Courtney Kreider told AFP.  Two of the dead were found in a car on Sunday, apparently caught in the flames as they tried to flee.  There were no details about the other deaths.  At least 3,000 people have been told to leave their homes in and around the town of Klamath River, with 100 structures already destroyed.  ""Our goal today is to effectively communicate with people, and we're asking them to obey the evacuation orders,"" Kreider said.  ""Our priority is to protect life and property.""  State fire department CalFire said better weather overnight had helped limit the spread of the so-called McKinney Fire, but vegetation remained extremely dry and vulnerable to lightning strikes.  ""The continued threat of thunderstorms and the associated strong, erratic winds could result in increased fire behavior,"" CalFire said.  The fire, which is burning in the Klamath National Forest near the border with Oregon, is California's largest this year, having consumed around 56,000 acres (22,600 hectares).  Firefighters were working to contain its spread, using bulldozers to create firebreaks around Yreka.  They were also battling spot fires, which erupt as sparks shoot off from the main blaze and ignite some distance away.  Those who had fled the flames spoke of the speed with which they were spreading.  ""When we left, everything was on fire,"" Sherri Marchetti-Perrault told the Los Angeles Times of her home.  ""It happened so fast. We left with the clothes on our back. We couldn't breathe and we couldn't see.""    - 'Holding out' -     Some were not prepared to go until absolutely necessary.  ""I'm holding out trying not to leave too soon because I'm helping out my mom,"" said Rafael Franco, who lives inside the mandatory evacuation area.  ""She's not in the best physical health to get around,"" Franco told AFP.  ""At the last minute if I see the fire cross the ridge where we are, we are going to head out and grab what we can and get going and hope for the best.""  California, along with much of the western United States, is in the grip of its worst drought in more than 1,000 years.  The drought, exacerbated by man-made climate change, has left the countryside parched and vulnerable to naturally occurring wildfires, making the blazes hotter, faster and more destructive.  Dennis Burns, a fire behavior analyst with the California Interagency Incident Management Team, said there was a potential for thunderstorms and heavy downpours on Tuesday that could give firefighters the edge they were looking for.  ""We're not expecting any significant movement of the fire but we could still see active flaming,"" he said.  ""For today we have a very moist atmosphere and are expecting some severe thunderstorms.  ""With the weather we have we're pretty confident that we're going to see some success.""  The McKinney Fire comes just days after the Oak Fire near Yosemite National Park destroyed dozens of buildings and forced thousands to evacuate.  California still has months of fire season ahead of it.  Other parts of the world have also faced intense wildfires this year, as scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent and more intense, increasing the risk of fires.  bur-hg/bfm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113954165']

Politician Yevgeny Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, was detained for ""discrediting"" the Russian army in comments about Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.  ""The suspect was detained in Yekaterinburg and will be taken to Moscow for investigation,"" the Moscow branch of Russia's interior ministry said in a statement.   It said he faces criminal charges of ""discrediting"" the Russian army and will be brought to Moscow as part of the investigation.  The charges are punishable by up to 10 years in jail.  A dozen armed police in camouflage on Wednesday burst into the 59-year-old's home, according to a video posted on the Mash Telegram channel, reputed to be close to the Russian security services.  His lawyer Vladislav Idamzhapov later told state news agency TASS that Roizman had been placed in custody for 48 hours.  The Moscow police said Roizman posted a video online, ""the contents of which discredited the use of"" the Russian armed forces.  A police source quoted earlier by TASS said the video was published on the politician's YouTube channel.  In a video filmed outside his apartment on Wednesday, Roizman told reporters he was being charged for using the word ""invasion"" to describe what Russia calls its military operation in Ukraine.  Roizman has already been fined three times for criticising Russia's offensive in Ukraine.  In a recent interview with AFP, Roizman said he has ""no illusions"" and understood that he could face arrest for his views.  ""But I also have no fear,"" he said.  Roizman was a lawmaker between 2003 and 2007. In 2013, he became Russia's highest-profile opposition mayor and held the position for five years.  Last year he was sentenced to nine days in jail for urging people to join demonstrations in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.

The Philippines, ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Ballot counting began after polls closed on Wednesday in the oil-rich nation, where multi-party polls were only introduced in 1992.  Preliminary results published overnight by Angola's electoral commission gave the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) 60.65 percent of the vote with 33 percent of ballots counted.   The main opposition the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by charismatic leader Adalberto Costa Junior was at 33.85 percent.  The MPLA has ruled Angola for nearly 50 years after the country gained independence from Portugal.  Lourenco, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised a new era for the southern African nation when he succeeded veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos five years ago, has trumpeted a list of achievements.  He is credited with making far-reaching reforms, including boosting financial transparency and efficiency in parastatal organisations, fighting sweeping nepotism and corruption, and promoting business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors.  But UNITA's deputy leader Abel Chivukuvuku said the party own tally showed it was ahead.  - Economic woes -    ""Our poll counting centres ... give us clear provisional indication of a winning trend for UNITA in all provinces of the country,"" he told a live streamed night conference. ""We are confident, calm and tranquil"".    The MPLA traditionally wields a grip over the electoral process and state media and opposition and civic groups have raised fears of voter tampering.  Results in past elections have been contested, in a process that can take several weeks.  The election has been overshadowed by Angola's many woes -- a struggling economy, inflation, poverty and drought, compounded by the death of a former strongman president.  More than 14 million people were registered to vote.  Angola is Africa's second largest crude producer, but the oil bonanza also nurtured corruption and nepotism under dos Santos, who died in Spain last month.  The low-key, night-time repatriation of his remains in the final leg of campaigning has added a macabre touch to the election.

""To safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics -- ever,"" she told the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is vetting her nomination.  ""The DNI must prioritize transparency, accountability, analytic rigor, facilitating oversight and diverse thinking -- not as afterthoughts, but as strategic imperatives that bolster our work and our institutions.""

Iran's Telecommunications Minister Issa Zarepour, who also attended the launch of the Khayyam satellite, called the event ""historic"" and ""a turning point for the start of a new interaction in the field of space between our two countries"".  Nasser Kanani, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said on Twitter that ""the brilliant path of scientific and technological progress of the Islamic republic of Iran continues despite sanctions and the enemies' maximum pressure"".  Iran, which has maintained ties with Moscow and refrained from criticism of the Ukraine invasion, has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to spy on Ukraine.  Last week, The Washington Post quoted anonymous Western intelligence officials as saying that Russia ""plans to use the satellite for several months or longer"" to assist its war efforts before allowing Iran to take control.  Less than two hours after the satellite was launched on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket, the Iran Space Agency (ISA) said ""ground stations of the Iran Space Agency"" had already received ""first telemetric data"".   The space agency stressed on Sunday that the Islamic republic would control the satellite ""from day one"" in an apparent reaction to the Post's report.  ""No third country is able to access the information"" sent by the satellite due to its ""encrypted algorithm"", it said.  The purpose of Khayyam is to ""monitor the country's borders"", enhance agricultural productivity and monitor water resources and natural disasters, according to the space agency.    - 'Long-term cooperation' -    Khayyam, apparently named after the 11th-century Persian polymath Omar Khayyam, will not be the first Iranian satellite that Russia has put into space.   In 2005, Iran's Sina-1 satellite was deployed from Russia's Plesetsk cosmodrome.  Iran is currently negotiating with world powers, including Moscow, to salvage a 2015 deal aimed at reining in Tehran's nuclear ambitions.  The United States -- which quit the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump -- has accused Iran of effectively supporting Russia's war against Ukraine while adopting a ""veil of neutrality"".  Russian President Vladimir Putin met Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran last month -- one of his few trips abroad since Moscow's February 24 invasion.   Iran's Khamenei called for ""long-term cooperation"" with Russia during their meeting, and Tehran has refused to join international condemnation of Moscow's invasion of its pro-Western neighbour.  Iran insists its space programme is for civilian and defence purposes only, and does not breach the 2015 nuclear deal, or any other international agreement.   Western governments worry that satellite launch systems incorporate technologies interchangeable with those used in ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, something Iran has always denied wanting to build.  Iran successfully put its first military satellite into orbit in April 2020, drawing a sharp rebuke from the United States.  On the eve of the Khayyam launch, ISA praised ""the high reliability factor of the Soyuz launcher"".  Borisov, who last month replaced bombastic nationalist Dmitry Rogozin as head of the Russian space agency, had acknowledged that the national space industry is in a ""difficult situation"" amid tensions with the West.  Russia will continue its space programme but end activities at the International Space Station -- an outlier of cooperation between Moscow and the West -- after 2024, he said.  cr-bur/jj",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

The debacle forced the resignations late Thursday of Capitol Police chief Steven Sund and the top security officials of the two chambers of Congress, the sergeants-at-arms.  As dust settled on the extraordinary scenes of a besieged seat of power, voices were quickly raised to ask why the 2,300-strong Capitol Police force so easily gave way to protesters, appearing not to try to arrest them.  And the ease with which they breached security barriers to rampage through the white-domed building at the center of Washington -- terrorizing lawmakers and briefly shutting down Congress -- laid bare a serious security threat two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.  Top lawmakers in the House and Senate demanded investigations into the breach, saying it exposed a weakness that should not be have been there since the September 11, 2001 attacks.  ""It was well known that extremist groups, some of whom desire to foment civil war, were planning violence,"" said Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.  ""Nearly 20 years after 9/11, we still clearly have massive gaps in the Federal government's terrorism preparedness and response capabilities,"" he said.    - 'Robust plan' -    The images of hundreds of Trump supporters easily pushing into the main building of Congress despite a lockdown, striding through the halls and climbing on statues while guards had guns drawn to protect lawmakers, have never been seen before by Americans.  Police and defense officials said they had been planning for the January 6 rally of violent Proud Boys and other militia, QAnon conspiracy theorists, and other die-hard Trump followers for weeks.  It was timed for the day Congress was to confirm Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the November 3 election -- a verdict Trump and followers have refused to accept.  Despite many planning meetings and tracking the likely attendees, officials said they didn't expect the group to besiege the Congress.    ""The USCP had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities,"" said Sund, referring to protests protected by the US constitution's guarantee of free speech.  ""But make no mistake -- these mass riots were not First Amendment activities; they were criminal riotous behavior.""    - Nobody called -    The unique structure of policing in Washington, the US capital with broad swathes of federal government property but also a city unto itself, fed into the disastrous attack on Congress.  The Capitol Police control the area around the Congress, and the city's larger, better-trained force can't go there unless asked.  The siege of the Capitol building was well underway when they were called in at about 1.00 pm (1800 GMT) Wednesday, said metropolitan Washington police chief Robert Contee.  ""Things were already pretty bad at that point,"" he told a press conference Thursday.  The city government also directs local National Guard forces which had been called up to help with the demonstrations.   But Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was never asked for their help Wednesday.  ""The Capitol Police and the leadership at the Capitol, they did not make the decision to call in guard support. I cannot order the army, National Guard to the United States Capitol grounds.""  In fact, said Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, through multiple meetings with all the stakeholders including Capitol Police, Sund's team repeatedly rejected offers of provisional support.  ""There was no request and it was necessary to have requests for planning and coordination of any sort to be conducted in the event of a crisis situation,"" said McCarthy, who oversees the national Guard in the US capital.    - Michigan kidnap plot    The breach was embarrassingly easy and clearly dangerous.   Capitol Police had their weapons drawn at several points but didn't stop the breach. At one point, however, one officer fired his weapon at the demonstrators, hitting and killing a woman.  Several protesters were arrested with weapons and two pipe bombs and a car laden with Molotov cocktails were also discovered by the Capitol.  Among the crowd of Trump fans were a number of members of armed militia groups known to be a threat.   Some were from Michigan, where last summer a similar pro-Trump group heavily armed with assault rifles, invaded the Michigan state capitol to protest Covid-19 controls.  In October the FBI arrested 13 in a plot to kidnap and possibly execute Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a critic of Trump.  And the FBI has called right-wing extremists the biggest threat of domestic terrorism.  But Contee admitted they didn't know what the protesters had planned.  ""There was no intelligence that suggested there would be a breach of the US Capitol,"" he said.  Bowser and Biden both pointed out that the Trump administration treated the Black Lives Matter protesters who descended on Washington last year much more harshly than those rioting on Wednesday.  McCarthy said the Interior and Homeland Security departments which sent in law enforcement last summer for leftist protests didn't request any forces this time.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104705419', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104717056']"

But White House spokesman John Kirby said a US aircraft carrier task force, sailing east of Taiwan, would remain in the region to monitor the situation after China conducted military live-fire exercises.  ""China has chosen to overreact and use the speaker's visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,"" Kirby told reporters.  Kirby called China's actions part of a ""manufactured crisis"" but also said that Beijing was attempting to alter the regional power balance.  ""It's also a pretext to try to up the ante... and to actually try to set a new status quo, to get to a new normal where they think they can keep things at,"" Kirby said.  ""And my point coming out here today was  making clear that we're not going to accept a new status quo.""  ""The temperature's pretty high,"" Kirby said.  Tensions ""can come down very easily by just having the Chinese stop these very aggressive military drills and flying missiles in and around the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.  Kirby confirmed reports that the Pentagon had postponed a scheduled test launch of a nuclear-capable ballistic missile to avoid stoking tensions.  ""We do not believe it is in our interests, Taiwan's interests, the region's interests, to allow tensions to escalate further,"" Kirby said.  ""As China engages in destabilizing military exercises around Taiwan, the United States is demonstrating instead the behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation.""

According to a Chinese military-backed research group, South China Sea Probing Initiative, the Reagan was about 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) due east of Taiwan on Wednesday.  Kirby said the carrier group has been ordered by the Pentagon to ""remain on station in the general area to monitor the situation.""

Even though Moscow has been able to pull in billions of dollars from continued energy sales at elevated prices, largely unpublished data shows that much of its domestic economic activity has stalled since the February 24 invasion, according to the report released in late July.  ""The findings of our comprehensive economic analysis of Russia are powerful and indisputable: Not only have sanctions and the business retreat worked, they have thoroughly crippled the Russian economy at every level,"" said the report from the Yale School of Management.  ""Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent,"" the 118-page report said.  The report was produced by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, and other members of the institute, a mix of economists and business management experts.  With Moscow having halted or pared the release of official economic statistics, including crucial trade figures, Sonnenfeld's group tapped into data held by companies, banks, consultants, Russian trading partners and others to build a picture of Russian economic performance.  They also said they obtained unreleased data from experts on the Russian economy, and data in other languages which supported their conclusions.  Even if Russia is able to earn more foreign exchange on gas and oil exports, that has not offset the impact of Western sanctions.  And, they argue, the country's dependence on Europe to buy 83 percent of its energy exports leaves it under a greater medium-term threat.  ""Russia is far more dependent on Europe than Europe is on Russia,"" they said.    - Car industry crashes -    Russia largely survived Western economic sanctions after Moscow's 2014 seizure of the Ukraine region of Crimea.  President Vladimir Putin pushed a program of replacing some imports with domestic products and built up a cushion of financial reserves.  But the country's industry remained heavily driven by foreign capital investment and the import of higher-tech inputs that Russia had not mastered, like semiconductors.  The barrage of deeper sanctions after the invasion took aim at both of those vulnerabilities, the report said.  Some 1,000 foreign companies halted their activities in the country, potentially impacting up to five million jobs, according to the report.  Industrial output plunged, and Russian retail sales and consumer spending have fallen at an annual rate of 15-20 percent.  Imports have plunged across the board, the report said; crucial imports from China fell by more than half.  A key example of Russian problems, according to the report, is the automobile sector.  Car sales went from 100,000 a month to 27,000 a month, and output has stalled due to a lack of parts and machinery.  Without access to imported components, Russian producers are putting out cars without airbags or modern anti-lock brakes, and only with manual transmissions.    - Threat to gas revenues -    The report challenged the belief that the Russian economy was surviving thanks to the tens of billions of dollars the country reaps each month from oil and gas exports.  Last week the IMF said the Russian economy, though contracting, was doing better than expected due to its energy and commodity export income.  The Yale report said data indicates energy revenues have been falling for the last three months.  If Western Europe succeeds in cutting itself off from Russian natural gas, Moscow faces an ""unsolvable"" situation with a lack of a market for its output, according to the report.  ""Any decrease in oil and gas revenues or oil and gas export volumes would immediately put a strain on the Kremlin's budget,"" it said.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96016136']

Dramatic amateur footage shared on social media appeared to show panicked holidaymakers fleeing a Crimean beach with young children, as ballooning clouds of grey smoke rose over the horizon.  The blasts rocked the Saki airfield on the 167th day of Moscow's invasion.  Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and has used the region as a staging ground for its attacks on Ukraine, but it has rarely been a target for Ukrainian forces.  The Russian defence ministry said ""several aviation munitions detonated"" at the base in an incident the head of the region said had left one person dead.   Local health officials earlier said five people, including one child, had been injured.  The defence ministry said it was looking to establish the reason for the explosions but indicated the airfield was not targeted in an attack.  There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv.  Ukraine's army, which for months pleaded for long-range artillery from Western allies, has been hitting targets deeper in Russian-held territory since some started arriving in recent weeks.   Kyiv has also taken credit for several acts of sabotage inside Russian-held territory.  Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine in the wake of massive nationwide street demonstrations that led to the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president.  Those protests precipitated fighting between the army and Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, which would lay the groundwork for Moscow's full-scale assault on February 24 this year.  The invasion has left thousands dead, forced millions in Ukraine from their homes, and led to a deep rupture in economic ties between Russia and the West.    - Mandatory evacuations -    In response to economic sanctions against Moscow for the invasion, Russia has squeezed gas deliveries to Europe.  It announced on Tuesday that its oil deliveries through Ukraine had been halted.  Transneft, the Russian pipeline operator, said the Ukrainian side had stopped flows because it was ""not receiving funds for these services"".  The Ukrainian side did not comment.  One of the impacted countries, Slovakia, confirmed flows had been halted for several days, and a spokesman for Bratislava refinery Slovnaft cited ""technical problems at the bank level in connection with the payment of transit fees from the Russian side"".  The Kremlin lashed out after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview that Europe should close their borders to Russians in response to the war.   The Ukrainian leader told The Washington Post that current Western sanctions against Moscow were too weak, in a call that has been echoed by Russia's neighbours Estonia and Finland.  ""The irrationality of thinking in this case is off the charts,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.  On the frontlines, Ukraine said Russia was pursuing a campaign of bombardment of the east of the country that has left much of the industrial Donbas region in ruins.  Kyiv said Tuesday it had transported at least 3,000 people out of the battle-scarred eastern region of Donetsk since it ordered evacuations ahead of winter.   The Ukrainian authorities are asking people to leave the area, as they do not expect to be able to provide it with heat during the cold winter months.  The presidency earlier said that three people had been killed and 19 more wounded in Russian shelling across the Donetsk region on Monday.  The head of the central region of Dnipro, meanwhile, said that 11 medical facilities had relocated there from the battle-torn Kharkiv and Lugansk regions further east.  ""Those facilities transferred over 100 pieces of equipment and 10 ambulances,"" Dnipro regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.  ""The hospitals are restarting work.

A devout Catholic, the 78-year-old Biden is as apt to quote Scripture as he is his beloved Irish poets.  Just the second Catholic president in US history -- John F. Kennedy was the first -- Biden wears his faith on his sleeve.  Literally.  Around his left wrist he often sports a rosary from the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico that his son Beau was wearing the day he died of brain cancer in 2015.  He frequently credits his working-class Irish Catholic roots with shaping his values on social and economic issues.  Biden rarely misses a Sunday mass when at home in Delaware, attending services at St. Joseph on the Brandywine, a small, quaint church in an affluent suburb.  It is there that Biden's parents are buried along with Beau. Also there are the graves of Biden's first wife, Neilia, and their daughter Naomi, who were killed in a 1972 traffic accident.  Beau and his brother Hunter survived the crash.  Biden took the oath of office on Wednesday as the 46th president of the United States with his left hand on a colossal 19th-century family Bible held by his wife, Jill.  His inauguration address included several biblical references and he paused his speech for a moment of silent prayer for the 400,000 people in the United States who have died of coronavirus.  Biden started his first full day at work in the White House on Thursday by watching a virtual prayer service at the National Cathedral with Vice President Kamala Harris.    - 'Understanding, reconciliation, peace' -    Biden made it clear from the outset that as president he will not hesitate to use the power of religion to help bridge the gaping chasm between Republicans and Democrats left by Donald Trump's attempts to subvert the presidential election.  He invited congressional leaders -- including top Republicans -- to attend services at St. Matthew's Cathedral, a Catholic Church in Washington, on the morning of his inauguration.  Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, respective Republican leaders in the Senate and House, both accepted the invitation instead of attending departure ceremonies for Trump.  The political divide is not the only one Biden faces as he takes office.  His inauguration was met with mixed messages from Pope Francis and the president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).  Francis, in a message warmly congratulating Biden, expressed hope that his decisions ""will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom.""  Recognizing that Biden has his work cut out for him, the pontiff wished him success in fostering ""understanding, reconciliation and peace within the United States.""  Jose Gomez, Archbishop of Los Angeles and president of the USCCB, said he was inspired by how Biden's faith has ""brought him solace in times of darkness and tragedy.""  ""He is our first president in 60 years to profess the Catholic faith,"" Gomez said in a statement.  ""In a time of growing and aggressive secularism in American culture, when religious believers face many challenges, it will be refreshing to engage with a president who clearly understands, in a deep and personal way, the importance of religious faith and institutions,"" he said.  Gomez stressed, however, that the USCCB has differences of opinion with Biden on several issues important to the Church, particularly abortion.  Biden supports the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decision which affirmed a woman's right to an abortion -- a position that led most evangelical Christians to support the anti-abortion Trump in the November election along with nearly 50 percent of Catholics.  ""Our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage and gender,"" Gomez said.  The USCCB president's statement was in sharp contrast to that of the Pope and came under fire from some other prominent figures in the US Catholic Church.  The archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Blase Cupich, called it ""ill-considered"" and a ""surprise to many bishops.""",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The internet went down on the eve of the vote, with some parts of the country reporting complete disruptions or significant slowdowns, after one of the most violent campaigns in years.  Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, having ruled for almost four decades, against singer-turned-MP Bobi Wine, 38, whose popularity among a youthful population has rattled the former rebel leader.  Wine said several of his party's polling agents had been arrested during the morning, as he cast his vote on the outskirts of Kampala alongside his wife to a crowd of dancing and singing supporters.  ""In 22 districts our teams are on the run because they are being surrounded and pursued by police and soldiers as if they are criminals,"" he said.  Soldiers marched in Kamwokya, the crowded Kampala slum where Wine grew up and is hugely popular, while convoys of riot police patrolled the capital.  Early reports from some districts outside the capital indicated voting was proceeding smoothly amid a heavy security presence.  Museveni's office said the president would vote later in the afternoon but were already confident of the outcome.  ""We are sure of the win,"" Don Wanyama, the presidential spokesman, told AFP.  - Delayed voting -    Wine is the strongest of 10 opposition contenders. But Museveni has never lost an election, and most observers expect he and his ruling National Resistance Movement to emerge victorious.  Nevertheless optimism was high in the opposition heartland of Kamwokya, where voters jostled into tight queues despite efforts to impose social distancing after weeks of rising coronavirus cases.  ""I am here to change the leadership of this nation because for years, they've been telling me they will secure my future. They have not done that,"" said driver Joseph Nsuduga, 30.  Some 18 million voters are registered for the presidential and parliamentary vote, and results are expected by Saturday.  ""I continue to encourage all Ugandans to turn out and vote,"" Wine said.  Voting was delayed in several locations in Kampala and queues snaked for hours, with Wine complaining of problems with the biometric machines used to confirm voter identities.  ""People have been waiting for so long,"" said Kyazike Eva, 50.  The opposition frontrunner has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen.  - Generation gap -    Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  He has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  But he is still held in high regard by older Ugandans who remember the relative stability and security that Museveni returned to the country.  ""These young people, they want change, but they don't know what Museveni did for us,"" said Faith Florence Nakalembe, 58.  But her children, also standing in line in Kamwokya to vote, desperately want change.  Sophie Mukoone, 34, said she spent months trying to change her mother's mind, but at least her brother Saad was out voting for the first time.  ""For 23 years I have never seen a different president, and I want someone else,"" said Saad Mukoone, a 23-year-old student throwing his vote behind Wine.  ""Most of the people in government are old, and they don't want to leave.""  - Crackdown -    The runup to polling day was marred by a sustained crackdown on Museveni's rivals and government critics, and unprecedented attacks on the nation's media and human rights defenders.  In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces loyal to Museveni during protests against one of Wine's numerous arrests.  The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  On Tuesday, Museveni announced the suspension of social media networks and messaging services like Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp in response to Facebook closing accounts linked to government officials the tech giant said were spreading misinformation.  str-np/fb/ri         FACEBOOK    Twitter","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

The lightning hit Lafayette Square, a small park across the street from the White House, shortly before 7:00 pm (2300 GMT) Thursday, leaving two men and two women with ""critical life-threatening injuries,"" according to a statement from Washington's fire and emergencies department.  All the victims were taken to local hospitals, but on Friday morning the Metropolitan Police confirmed that two of them -- 75-year-old Donna Mueller and 76-year-old James Mueller, both from Janesville in Wisconsin -- had been pronounced dead.   The other two adults remain in critical condition, police said.  A White House spokeswoman said the Biden administration was ""saddened by the tragic loss of life.""  ""We are praying for those still fighting for their lives,"" added Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement.  US Secret Service and park police rushed to help the four after witnessing the strike, fire and emergency services department spokesman Vito Maggiolo said in a statement posted on social media.  Photos posted by the department on social media showed multiple ambulances and at least one fire truck with flashing lights working at the scene.  Witness David Root told NBC he heard a ""horrific boom.""  ""I just couldn't believe it,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Was surreal. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.""  He said he had been sheltering beneath a tree when he saw the lightning strike across the park.   The people ""weren't moving,"" he said, so he and others ran over to give help.  The Washington Post said the four were found some 100 feet from the statue of former US president Andrew Jackson which marks the center of the square.  The strike was part of a severe thunderstorm that hit the American capital on Thursday evening.  ""Trees are not safe places,"" Maggiolo told the Post.

Biden, who himself has suffered deep personal tragedy of his own and who is known for his public displays of emotion, has stressed the need to unite the country after President Donald Trump's chaotic four years in office.  ""It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" Biden said in somber remarks at the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial.  Inauguration eve is normally a time of massive crowds gathering in the capital, but Biden, joined by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, were almost alone on the empty National Mall due to Covid restrictions and heightened security after the deadly riot at the US Capitol.  On the Mall's grassy expanse, some 200,000 flags have been planted to represent the absent crowds at the inauguration ceremony on Wednesday.  Trump, who has not appeared in public for a week, broke days of silence with a pre-recorded farewell video address.  For the first time he asked Americans to ""pray"" for the success of the incoming administration -- a change from months spent persuading his Republican followers that the Democrats cheated their way to election victory.    - Trump snub -    Trump, whose efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and console its victims have been widely criticized, will snub Biden by not attending the inauguration.  He has also yet to personally congratulate Biden on his win or invite him for the customary cup of tea in the Oval Office.  In one of his last acts before he flies to Florida on Wednesday morning, Trump is expected to issue scores of pardons, with speculation rife over who might make the list.  The latest indications are that Trump will not take the legally dubious step of issuing himself and his children preemptive pardons.  Outside the White House fence, central Washington has taken on a dystopian look ahead of Biden's inauguration, swarming with National Guard troops and largely emptied of ordinary people.  Fears of right-wing attacks in the wake of the pro-Trump riot in the Capitol building on January 6 have triggered unprecedented deployment of armed personnel, concrete barriers and secure areas dubbed ""green"" and ""red"" zones.  Adding to the tension, the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.    - Biden comes to town -    Earlier on Tuesday, tears rolled down Biden's cheeks at a farewell ceremony in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where he paid tribute to his late son Beau, a rising politician who died of brain cancer in 2015 aged 46.  ""I only have one regret, that he's not here,"" Biden said.  Biden, a veteran Democratic senator who also served as vice president to Barack Obama, is staying overnight with his wife Jill in Blair House, a residence for heads of state and other important visitors across the street from the White House.  His inaugural speech will last between 20-30 minutes, according to a source familiar with preparations, and ""he will reach out to all Americans, and call on every citizen to be part of meeting the extraordinary challenges facing all of us.""  To symbolize the new spirit, Biden has invited the two top senators -- Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell -- and other congressional leaders to attend a church service with him on Wednesday before the inauguration.  A person familiar with McConnell's plans confirmed to AFP the Republican congressional leader would join Biden, a longtime Senate colleague, in church.    - Pardons -    According to CNN and other US outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he may grant clemency to.  After what The New York Times reports has been an intense lobbying effort, these are expected to be a mix of white-collar criminals and people whose cases have been championed by criminal justice activists.  More controversial possible pardons that have been the subject of speculation for months would be for the likes of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Trump's influential advisor Steve Bannon.  But Trump has, according to latest US media reports, moved away from the temptation to issue himself a preemptive pardon. This would anger his Republican backers in the Senate right ahead of the start of the impeachment trial.  Although Trump was easily acquitted thanks to party support in his first impeachment last year, this time it may not go as well.  Senior Senate Republican McConnell said in blistering comments Tuesday that Trump had ""provoked"" his supporters and that the ""mob was fed lies"" before embarking on the assault against Congress.  sms-mlm/bgs/jm   THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Mahdi Mujahid's split with the Taliban leadership in June is the highest-profile public division seen in the hardline Islamist group since they returned to power in August last year.  He was appointed intelligence chief of Bamiyan province at the time, but months later was sacked following a dispute local media attributed to control of the lucrative coal trade.  Mujahid went on the run in June after the Taliban sent thousands of troops to crush his loyalists.  Days of fighting raged, with the United Nations estimating at least 27,000 people were displaced by the violence.   Afghanistan's mostly Shiite ethnic Hazaras have faced persecution for decades, and Mujahid's appointment was initially seen as supporting the Taliban's claim of being more inclusive to non-Pashtuns.   On Wednesday, officials said border forces identified Mujahid in Herat province, near the frontier with Iran, and ""punished him for his deeds"".  ""He didn't have anyone with him,"" provincial information officer Naeemul Haq Haqqani told AFP, adding he was ""killed after a conflict"".  Pictures circulating on social media, however, purported to show Mujahid alive and in custody. Haqqani dismissed those reports.  ""Rumours that this person was captured alive are lies,"" he said.  The Taliban were accused of abuses against the Hazaras when they first ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.  The Hazaras are also the target of attacks by the Sunni Islamic State group, which considers them heretics.  bur-fox/jd/aha","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113551461', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113550033']"

Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Moscow-installed regional administration, said Ukrainian forces ""once again struck the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant"" in southern Ukraine on messaging app Telegram.  According to Rogov, Ukrainians used multiple launch rocket systems and heavy artillery to carry out the strikes.

Out of 20 people detained in the latest sweep, ""19 of them are Islamic Jihad,"" the army said.   The latest deadly escalation in Gaza was sparked by Israel's arrest earlier this week in the West Bank of Bassem al-Saadi, a key Islamic Jihad member Israel blamed for orchestrating a spate of attacks.  Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed Islamist group, has a strong presence in Gaza and the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967.

The group initially set up by students at the Islamic University of Gaza is seen as a sister organisation to Hamas, the Islamists who have controlled the Palestinian enclave since 2007.   Both were born out of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that was established in Egypt last century.  While primarily based in Gaza, Islamic Jihad also has a strong presence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.   Israel insists the group's ties with Iran, the Jewish state's top foe, have deepened.   Prime Minister Yair Lapid noted that Islamic Jihad's leader, Ziad al-Nakhala, was in Iran when he authorised ""pre-emptive"" strikes against the group on Friday, citing the threat of attacks.   ""The head of Islamic Jihad is in Tehran as we speak,"" Lapid said, just hours after Israeli jets killed Taysir al-Jabari, one of the group's key military leaders in Gaza.  Major General Hossein Salami, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, told Nakhala on Saturday during a meeting in Tehran: ""We are with you on this path until the end.""  In 1992, Islamic Jihad's armed wing, known as the Al-Quds Brigade, was founded.  The group was led by enigmatic writer and doctor Fathi Shaqaqi until 1995, when he was assassinated in Malta by a hit squad sent by Israel's spy agency, Mossad.   Designated as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the European Union among others, Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for many suicide bombings targeting Israelis, notably through the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, from 2000 to 2005.  One of the group's most prominent attacks was in 1989 on a bus travelling between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem that killed 16 people.   Many of the group's senior leaders have been based in Damascus, Syria.  They reject any negotiations with Israel and staunchly opposed the Oslo peace accords.   While the group regularly operates in coordination with Hamas, notably during an 11-day conflict with Israel last May, the ongoing conflict further highlights its independence.   Hamas has not fired rockets at Israel since the flare up began on Friday.  In 2019, Hamas sat out of fighting between Israel and Islamic Jihad that was triggered by Israel's assassination of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor.  gb-az/bs/lg",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Israel has said it was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, insisting the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the Gaza border.  Health authorities in Gaza, a Palestinian enclave controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said 12 people have been killed by Israel's bombardment, including a five-year-old girl, with more than 80 others injured.   Israel's closure of a key goods crossing four days ago resulted in Gaza's sole power plant shutting down on Saturday.  Israel and Islamic Jihad have both confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key leader of the militants, in a Friday strike on a building in the west of Gaza city.   Islamic Jihad, a group that is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently, said that initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"" and unleashed a barrage of rockets towards Israel.  The rocket fire and Israeli strikes were continuing on Saturday, risking a repeat of an 11-day conflict in May 2021 that devastated Gaza and forced countless Israelis to rush to bomb shelters.  Daily life in the enclave has come to a standstill, with streets largely deserted and most shops closed.   Mohammed Thabet, spokesman for the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company, said Saturday the power station shut down ""due to the fuel shortage"".  Diesel for the plant is usually trucked in from Egypt or Israel, which closed its two border crossings with Gaza on Tuesday citing security concerns.    - Escalation, mediation -    ""Israel isn't interested in a wider conflict in Gaza, but will not shy away from one either,"" Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in a nationally televised address on Friday.   Air raid sirens sounded across southern Israel on Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.  The Israeli military said the vast majority of 160 rockets fired from Gaza had either fallen within the Palestinian territory, or been intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defence system.  Officials in border areas urged people to stay close to shelters, which have also been opened in the coastal city of Tel Aviv.   Egypt, a historic broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, was seeking to mediate and may host an Islamic Jihad delegation later Saturday, Egyptian officials told AFP in Gaza.  But sources within Islamic Jihad denied a ceasefire was on the cards, with one saying: ""there is no talk whatsoever of Egyptian mediation and for the movement the focus is on the battlefield.""  The Arab League ""condemned in the strongest possible terms the ferocious Israeli aggression against Gaza.""  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.   A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that episode.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.    - Five-year-old girl -    Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza City's main hospital, said medics are facing ""acute shortages of medical supplies"".   On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among those killed.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border, after the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.   The measures followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people it said were members of the group in the occupied West Bank.   Israel has conducted a near relentless wave of often deadly raids inside the West Bank since mid-March in response to lethal attacks on Israeli citizens.   bur-rsc/dwo",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Cuban-born Alejandro Mayorkas told a Senate panel that the reforms would include a path to citizenship for millions of longtime US residents without papers, and the possibility of asylum to others escaping abuse and violence.   ""President-elect Biden has committed to presenting Congress, on day one, with an immigration reform bill that, once and for all, fixes I think what we all can agree is a broken immigration system,"" Mayorkas told the Senate Homeland Security Committee.  Biden ""has spoken of the need for a path to citizenship for the individuals who have been in this country for many years, who have contributed to our communities and to this nation's economic prosperity,"" he said.  The Washington Post reported that Biden will unveil broad immigration reforms Wednesday just after he is inaugurated president.   According to the Post, they will include an eight-year track to gain citizenship for immigrants without legal status, and an increase in admissions, which Trump slashed to a trickle.  ""I would be privileged to work with Congress to pass immigration reform legislation that provides that path, and provides a permanent solution to what is clearly a broken system,"" said Mayorkas.     - Asylum -    Mayorkas told the committee, which is vetting his nomination, that if approved as secretary of Homeland Security he would roll back departing Trump's tough measures to seal the southern US border.  Arriving migrants would be permitted to apply for asylum and have their cases reviewed -- a process the Trump administration virtually ended, with the effect of sharply reducing migrant entry into the country, Mayorkas said.  Under Biden, ""There is a commitment to follow our asylum laws, to enforce our asylum laws,"" he said.  ""That means to provide humanitarian relief for those individuals who qualify for it.""  But, he added, ""it will take time to build the infrastructure and capacity.""  Mayorkas could face his first challenge, if approved, with thousands of migrants who set out from Honduras to reach US-Mexico border.  On Monday, security forces broke up the caravan which had amassed in the Guatemalan town of Vada Hondo and on Tuesday thousands were returned to Honduras on buses and trucks, halting their northward march.  Pressed on what he would do if they eventually reach the US border, Mayorkas said the asylum law would be applied.  ""This is not the first caravan, that has apparently approached the border over the last four years or ... over the last 12 years,"" he said.  ""When people present themselves at our border we apply the laws of our nation to determine whether they qualify for relief under our humanitarian laws, or whether they don't.""  ""If they do not qualify to remain in the United States, then they won't.""    - Halt to wall building -    Mayorkas, 61, is a former federal prosecutor who ran US immigration services and then was DHS deputy secretary during Barack Obama's administration.  He oversaw the implementation of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, meant to offer a way to citizenship for millions of longtime US residents who entered the country illegally.  If confirmed, Mayorkas said he did not envision radical changes to the sprawling, 240,000-strong DHS bureaucracy, whose mission is focused firstly on protecting the country from terror and cyber attacks and natural disasters.  He rejected calls by some Democrats and human rights groups to eliminate the DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which Trump used to round up tens of thousands of people without legal resident papers.  Mayorkas said Biden plans to halt Trump's program to build a wall along the long southern border, but said alternatives to slow illegal immigration include more electronic measures and possibly more personnel in some ares.  But his confirmation could run into some bumps.  After the hearing, Republican Senator Josh Hawley said he would hold up any push for fast confirmation.  ""Mr. Mayorkas has not adequately explained how he will enforce federal law and secure the southern border given President-elect Biden's promise to roll back major enforcement and security measures,"" he said in  a statement.  ""Given this, I cannot consent to skip the standard vetting process and fast-track this nomination when so many questions remain unanswered.""  pmh/jm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The Warner Bros biopic starring Daniel Kaluuya, out in theaters and on HBO Max streaming February 12, re-examines the life of young Black Panther leader Fred Hampton alongside the FBI informant who betrayed him.  Produced by Ryan Coogler -- director of Marvel superhero film ""Black Panther"" -- the film follows Hampton's attempts to galvanize Chicago activists against police violence, and an establishment that viewed the real-life Panthers as ""the single greatest threat to our national security.""  ""Our goal was to really make a movie that captured 1968. But so little has changed between 1968 and 2021, that we don't really have to draw parallels to the present,"" director Shaka King told a virtual press event.  The film -- which premiered at the Sundance film festival this week -- does not shy away from Hampton's incendiary speeches, including his infamous rallying cry: ""Kill a few pigs, get a little satisfaction... kill them all, get complete satisfaction.""  Kaluuya devoured Black Panther literature and Hampton's speeches to prepare for the role, hiring a singing coach to achieve the leader's fiery cadence.  But the film also spotlights the sometimes deadly harassment the Panthers faced, and shows the leader's more private, bashful side, employing his son and fiancee as consultants.  ""I collected and just read and took everything in, and trained, got myself bigger -- I did all that I can do to get into the spirit space of him,"" said the British actor known for ""Get Out"" and Marvel's ""Black Panther.""  ""They would die to protect their own, and to liberate their own,"" said Kaluuya, of Hampton's followers. ""That deeply inspired me.""    - 'Departed' meets Hoover -    With its double agents and biblical betrayal, King's film is billed by its director as ""'The Departed' inside the world of Cointelpro"" -- a reference to Martin Scorsese's 2006 crime thriller, and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's controversial network to spy on ""radical"" political groups.  Hoover's agents monitored domestic protesters against the US war in Vietnam, the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, and the black militant Panthers, until the program was officially scrapped in 1971.  Early in the film, petty Chicago criminal William O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) is caught trying to boost a car, and is convinced to infiltrate the self-styled revolutionaries to avoid prison.  The film is bookended with a real interview O'Neal gave decades later in which he clumsily sought to justify his actions, through a series of convoluted lies about his role in sabotaging the fledging movement.  ""It's a movie that's about the dangers of being apolitical, and how a lot of times, what can feel like inaction can be quite dangerous,"" King said.  Jesse Plemons stars as FBI agent Roy Mitchell, who coerces the film's ""Judas"" into ever greater deceit, but all the while finding ways to morally justify his actions.  ""The Panthers and the Klan are one and the same -- their aim is to sow hatred and inspire terror,"" he tells O'Neal.  Mitchell stands as a cautionary tale, because his politics of ""decency being prescriptive"" are ""not dissimilar to white liberal politics now,"" said King.  ""You saw this summer, all these companies rushing to put together Black Lives Matter hashtags and murals,"" the director said. ""But what is that really doing for US Black people in the long run?    - 'Propaganda' -    The movie follows hot on the heels of ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" -- Netflix's retelling of the city's 1968 anti-war riots -- and Amazon's civil rights-themed adaptation ""One Night in Miami.""  Real-life Black leaders including Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Bobby Seale, Hampton and even Muhammad Ali repeatedly feature or are quoted across the movies.  The films have emerged in the wake of the modern Black Lives Matter movement, which led global anti-racism protests last summer.  All three are seen as major contenders for April's Oscars.

Biden was sworn in as the 46th US president on Wednesday, delivering a calming call to heal a nation riven by festering divisions that had grown deeper under four years of Donald Trump.  Biden took the presidential oath standing on the steps of the US Capitol, the building complex that had been attacked two weeks earlier by a pro-Trump mob seeking to overturn his victory. Moments earlier Kamala Harris had taken the oath to officially become America's first female vice president.  ""Democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,"" Biden said before a National Mall that was virtually empty due to the ultra-tight security and a raging Covid-19 pandemic that he vowed to confront swiftly.  Absent from the ceremony was Trump, who had earlier left Washington for Florida, breaking 152 years of tradition by refusing to attend his successor's inauguration.  Trump has not publicly conceded defeat and spent the months since November's election falsely claiming he was cheated out of a second term.   Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama did however attend the inauguration.  ""I think if Americans would love their neighbor like they would like to be loved themselves, a lot of the division in our society would end,"" said Bush, a Republican.  Shortly after walking into the White House, his wife Jill by his side, Biden signed a flurry of executive orders, starting with rejoining the 2015 Paris climate accord from which the US withdrew under Trump.  ""We are going to combat climate change in a way we have not done so far,"" the new US leader said, speaking in the Oval Office as he signed papers on the Paris deal which was negotiated when Biden was Obama's vice president.  Biden's spokeswoman Jen Psaki said his first call to a foreign leader would be Friday to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- after Biden blocked the Keystone XL pipeline fiercely opposed by environmentalists but backed by Ottawa.  Biden also halted the US exit from the World Health Organization, stopped construction of Trump's cherished wall on the Mexican border, and rescinded a ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority nations.    - A full in-tray -    Biden's presidency will initially be shaped by his response to Covid-19, which has killed more than 400,000 people in the US, and the associated economic emergency.  He will look to move quickly on coordinating a federal plan to combat the virus, which for months ran rampant across the country as the Trump administration bungled its response.  Biden is expected to outline his administration's plans later Thursday after he is briefed by his Covid-19 team.  Whereas Trump seldom acknowledged the tragic toll the virus was inflicting on Americans, Biden paused in his inaugural address to offer a moment's silent prayer for the victims.  The veteran Democrat also appealed to supporters of Trump, who shattered political norms by ruthlessly belittling rivals, denouncing entire ethnic groups and trying to cast doubt on basic facts.  ""I will be a president for all Americans,"" Biden said.   Still, he confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as evidenced during Trump's presidency by the Capitol assault, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants, and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.  The United States faces ""a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat,"" Biden said.  Biden's inauguration ceremony, while steeped in pomp and tradition, was different from previous events, with no crowds and the National Mall closed.  Washington normally parties hard after an inauguration, but the US capital stayed quiet Wednesday.  A-listers made a valiant effort to keep up the energy at a mostly virtual, pre-produced show dubbed ""Celebrating America.""   At 78, Biden is the oldest-ever US president, a job he first sought in 1987, and is only the second Roman Catholic president after John F Kennedy.   Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history, and the first Black person and first person of Asian heritage as the nation's number two.   She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever ""second gentleman"" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who became a hero by luring away the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers.  bur-wat/ch",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Israel has said it was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, saying the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza.  Health authorities in the Palestinian enclave, which is controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said a five-year-old girl was among 15 people killed in the Israeli bombardment, adding that more than 120 others have been wounded.  In Jabalia, in the north of Gaza, Fouad Farajallah was on Saturday surveying what remained of his home, hit by an Israeli strike the day before.  ""I was sitting here on the sofa, with my wife and children, and suddenly it all fell on us,"" he said, surrounded by debris from a partially collapsed roof in a strike he said wounded his wife and son.  Israel's ongoing strikes are being met with barrages of rockets from the Palestinian side, stoking fears of a repeat of an 11-day conflict that devastated Gaza in May 2021.   Daily life in the enclave has come to a standstill, while the electricity distributor said the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Civilians on the Israeli side meanwhile took refuge in air raid shelters, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.   In Kibbutz Nahal Oz, an Israeli community beside the Gaza border, resident Nadav Peretz said he has been ""in the bomb shelter or around it"" since Friday.   ""We recognise that on the other side too there is an uninvolved civilian population, and on both sides children deserve to enjoy their summer vacation,"" the 40-year-old said.    - 'Declaration of war' -    An Israeli military spokesman said its forces were ""preparing for the operation to last a week,"" and told AFP that the army is ""not currently holding ceasefire negotiations"".  Sources within Islamic Jihad ruled out a ceasefire soon, with one saying: ""for the movement, the focus is on the battlefield"".   Israel and Islamic Jihad confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key commander of the militant group, in a Friday strike.  The Israeli bombardment has been condemned by Islamic Jihad's top backer Iran.  Israel has ""once again showed its occupying and aggressive nature to the world,"" said a statement from President Ebrahim Raisi's office.  Jamal al-Fadi, a political science professor at Gaza's Al-Azhar University, said he expected the violence to end ""within days"".  ""Islamic Jihad is reacting in a limited manner and by doing so is preventing the occupation (Israeli military) from intensifying its air strikes,"" he told AFP.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. Both are blacklisted as terrorist organisations by much of the West.  Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   A flare-up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that conflict.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial.  Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, said Hamas currently has an interest in staying on the sidelines as it has recently won more economic aid for Gazans.   ""But if more civilians are killed, then it will feel obligated to respond,"" she told AFP.    - Five-year-old girl -    Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza city's main hospital, said medics are facing ""acute shortages of medical supplies"".   On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among those killed.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said Friday ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  The Gaza strikes followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people in the West Bank it said were members of the group.   Israel has conducted a wave of often deadly raids inside West Bank towns and cities since mid-March in response to lethal attacks on Israelis.  bur-rsc/kir",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

""When I ended our military mission in Afghanistan almost a year ago, I made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan,"" Biden told the nation late Monday as he announced the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri.  ""I made a promise to the American people that we'd continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations... We've done just that.""  Announcing jihadist leader deaths has become a ritual -- both somber and highly political -- for presidents ever since the attacks of September 11, 2001.  Barack Obama's 2011 revelation of the daring operation to kill Osama bin Laden in his home in Pakistan electrified the nation. On hearing Obama, a skilled orator, people poured into the streets, chanting ""USA!""  Donald Trump took a different approach in 2019, using gory language to deliver news of a raid to kill Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi in Syria -- and to bolster his own strong man image.  ""He died like a dog,"" Trump said.  For Biden, the setting was inauspicious. Isolating from a case of rebound Covid-19, battered in the polls and facing the anniversary this month of the traumatic August 2021 exit of US troops from Kabul, the Democrat is in a weak position.  In a nod to Covid ventilation measures, his speech was delivered from the noisy balcony of the Blue Room. As he touted American resilience, Washington police sirens wailed in the background.  Yet the timing of the speech could not have been better for a president seeking to change the narrative.  While steering clear of triumphalism, Biden noted that Zawahiri had been on the wanted list ""for years under presidents (George W.) Bush, Obama and Trump.""  The implication -- that the country is safe in Biden's hands -- was clear.  ""No matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out,"" Biden said.    - Afghan strategy debate -    Critics on the right and left see last year's US withdrawal from Kabul as a show of ineptitude that, in addition to being a humiliating spectacle, will make Afghanistan a hotbed of anti-American Islamic groups, similar to the time of 9/11.  Biden argues he had the courage to pull the plug on a failed war conducted by three previous presidents and that there simply was never going to be a neat ending to the debacle.  Dismissing skeptics, he also promised that American ""over the horizon"" capabilities meant there'd be no more need to risk US lives on the ground.  Now with the Zawahiri killing, Biden has a golden opportunity to say that he's been proved right.  Afghanistan ""can't be a launching pad against the United States,"" Biden said in his speech. ""This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can, and we'll always make good on the solemn pledge.""    - Downsides -    There was instant praise from even unlikely quarters, with the anchor on the often hostile Fox News' evening broadcast calling it ""President Biden's bin Laden moment"" and ""a huge, huge win for the US.""  Some experts, however, caution against the White House spin.  James Jeffrey, a former US ambassador to Iraq and now chair of the Wilson Center think tank's Middle East Program, applauded the demonstration of ""excellent intelligence, an operational strike capability and decisiveness.""  However, that expertise does not outweigh the ""chaos"" of last year's Afghan withdrawal, which Jeffrey blamed on poor coordination and Biden's ""handicapping"" of staff through his refusal to accept there could be any downsides to pulling out -- or to plan for them.  Nathan Sales, another former diplomat who works at the Atlantic Council, said Zawahiri's mere presence in Kabul was a failure for the United States, suggesting ""as feared, the Taliban is once more granting safe haven to the leaders of Al-Qaeda.""  And it's too early to say whether one spectacular drone strike ""can be replicated against other terrorist targets,"" he said.  ""Until we know more, we should resist the urge to see the strike as a vindication of 'over the horizon' counterterrorism.""  sms/sw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113620994']

The resulting wall of water and debris barrelled down a tight valley in India's Himalayan north on Sunday morning, destroying bridges, roads and hitting two hydroelectric power plants.  ""There was a cloud of dust as the water went by. The ground shook like an earthquake,"" local inhabitant Om Agarwal told Indian TV.  The Uttarakhand state government said on Monday 18 bodies have been recovered, and chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said at least 200 people were still unaccounted for.  Most of those missing were working at the two power plants. Some were trapped in two tunnels cut off by the floods and by mud and rocks.  ""If this incident happened in the evening, after work hours, the situation wouldn't have been this bad as labourers and workers in and around the work sites would have been at home,"" Rawat told reporters.  Twelve people were rescued from one of the tunnels on Sunday but 25-35 more were still trapped in the second one, state disaster relief official Piyoosh Rautela told AFP.  With the main road washed away, paramilitary rescuers had to scale down a hillside on ropes to reach the entrance. Emergency workers were using heavy machinery to remove tonnes of rocks.  ""Approximately 80 metres (260 feet) inside the tunnel is cleared and accessible. It appears that approximately 100 metres of debris inside the tunnel is yet to be cleared,"" said Vivek Kumar Pandey, another disaster official.  Several hundred rescue workers resumed their search operation at first light on Monday including national and state disaster response teams, the army and navy diving teams.    - Disaster movie -    Scores of social media users captured the disaster, with footage showing water tearing through the narrow valley with terrifying force.  ""We were 300 meters inside the tunnel working. Suddenly there was whistling and shouting telling us to get out,"" said survivor Rajesh Kumar, 28.  ""We started running out but the water gushed in. It was like scenes from a Hollywood movie. We thought we wouldn't make it,"" he told AFP.  Authorities said initially that the cause was a chunk of glacier breaking off into a river, but the trigger may instead have been a phenomenon called a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF).  This is when the boundaries of a glacial lake -- formed when a glacier retreats -- are breached, releasing large amounts of water downstream.   It is possible that this in turn was caused by an avalanche. The incident may also have been triggered by water pockets inside a glacier bursting.  Glaciers in the region have been shrinking rapidly in recent years because of global warming, but experts say that the construction of hydroelectric plants could also be a factor.  Floods in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of projects in Uttarakhand, a state of 10 million people bordering Tibet and Nepal.  Vimlendhu Jha, founder of Swechha, an environmental NGO, said the disaster was a ""grim reminder"" of the effects of climate change and the ""haphazard development of roads, railways and power plants in ecologically sensitive areas"".  A major study in 2019 said that two-thirds of Himalayan glaciers, the world's ""Third Pole"", could melt by 2100 if global emissions are not sharply reduced.  Glaciers in the region are a critical source of water for hundreds of millions of people, feeding many of the world's most important river systems.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105358710']

""A criminal case has been launched,"" lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov told AFP, adding they were now waiting for investigators to decide on a pre-trial measure for the 44-year-old.  In a recent interview with AFP, Ovsyannikova had expressed hope that authorities would not place her in pre-trial detention because she has two children.  Writing on messaging app Telegram earlier in the day, Ovsyannikova said that 10 members of law enforcement raided her home at 6:00 am.  ""They scared my young daughter,"" she added.  In March, Ovsyannikova, then an editor at Channel One television, barged onto the set of its flagship Vremya (Time) evening news, holding a poster reading ""No War"" in English.   Criticism of President Vladimir Putin's decision to send troops to Ukraine has been virtually outlawed in Russia, and her protest made headlines around the world.  French President Emmanuel Macron has offered her asylum or other forms of consular protection.  The criminal probe against Ovsyannikova was launched after two Moscow courts ordered the journalist to pay fines for discrediting the Russian army.  Ovsyannikova said she had been accused of spreading ""fake"" information about the Russian army.  In mid-July, Ovsyannikova staged a one-woman protest near the Kremlin, holding a poster that read ""Putin is a murderer.""  Writing on Telegram on Wednesday, she said that more than 350 children had already died in Ukraine.  ""How many children have to die before you stop?"" she added.   In the months following her protest, Ovsyannikova spent time abroad, working for Germany's Die Welt for three months.

""No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday... they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol,"" Biden said in an address from his hometown  in Delaware.  ""We all know that's true, and it is unacceptable,"" said Biden, who will take over the White House on January 20, after winning November's election in part due to strong support from Black voters.  On Wednesday thousands of protesters -- spurred on by a speech given by President Donald Trump -- marched to the seat of the US legislature, where some broke down barriers and doors to invade the building in an unprecedented act that played out on live television.  But police officers in charge of security held off using tear gas until intruders had reached the heart of the building, where they roamed freely, ransacking offices.   US media reported that some law enforcement officials even opened doors for them.  The scene stood in stark contrast to last year's anti-racism protests in the nation's capital and beyond, which saw demonstrators forcibly dispersed by police, and the National Guard regularly deployed as an early preventive measure.   National Guard reinforcements did not arrive Wednesday until several hours into the chaos, despite participants publicizing their plans to gather days in advance.

The frigid air mass that paralyzed parts of the southern and central United States early in the week claimed more than 70 lives, left millions temporarily without power and froze water lines.  ""All of what happened this week was foreseeable and preventable,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" saying it had long been clear that the independent electric grid in Texas was vulnerable to extreme weather.  Turner said Houston, the fourth-largest US city, still needed both plumbing supplies and plumbers, but was making progress in restoring service.   Both Houston and nearby Galveston on Sunday lifted orders for residents to boil drinking water.   But some 28,000 households remained without electricity on Sunday, the poweroutage.us website said, and many Texans were suffering an added insult: residential electric bills sometimes running into the thousands of dollars, with one as high as $16,000.  While most of the state's utility customers are on fixed-rate plans, some had signed up to variable-rate plans that can save money in fair weather but produce explosive increases in frigid temperatures.  Governor Greg Abbott met with legislators of both parties Saturday to discuss the billing problem and said, ""We have a responsibility to protect Texans from spikes in their energy bills.""   For his part, Turner said ""those exorbitant costs (should be) borne by the state of Texas, and not the individual consumers who did not cause this catastrophe.""  President Joe Biden on Saturday issued a major-disaster declaration for much of the state, providing badly needed financial and administrative aid.  His spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Sunday that Biden hoped to visit Texas ""as early as this week"" if he could do so without interfering with recovery efforts.   Michael McCaul, a Republican congressman from Texas, said the financial impact of the weather crisis could equal that of Hurricane Harvey, a devastating 2017 storm that caused an estimated $125 billion in damages.  He said Biden's emergency declaration could provide funds to help users pay their exorbitant electric bills.   State and local officials have demanded investigations of how the power crisis unfolded so disastrously.  A US senator, Tina Smith, a Democrat of Minnesota, has called for a federal investigation. She said spot prices of natural gas had spiked by up to 100 times normal rates, and utilities passed the higher rates on to customers.  bbk/jm-mdl   CBS CORPORATION",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

The blaze broke out around 1:00 am (1800 GMT Thursday) at the Mountain B nightspot in Chonburi province's Sattahip district, about 150 kilometres (90 miles) south of Bangkok, an official from the Sawang Rojanathammasathan Rescue Foundation told AFP on condition of anonymity.  Video footage posted by the rescue service showed desperate revellers fleeing the club screaming, their clothes ablaze, as a huge fire rages in the background.  The service said the blaze was accelerated by flammable acoustic foam on the walls of the club, and it took firefighters more than three hours to bring it under control.  The dead -- four women and nine men -- were found mostly crowded by the entrance and in the bathroom, their bodies severely burned, the service said.   All the victims are believed to be Thai.  ""There is not death related to foreigners,"" police lieutenant colonel Boonsong Yingyong of the Phlu Ta Luang police station, which oversees the area where the blaze occurred, told AFP by phone.  Concerns have long been raised about Thailand's lax approach to health and safety regulations, particularly in its countless bars and nightclubs.  A massive inferno erupted at a New Year's Eve party at Bangkok's swanky Santika club in 2009, killing 67 people and injuring more than 200.  The Santika owner was jailed for three years over the blaze, which began when fireworks were let off as a rock band called Burn played on stage.  More recently, four people were killed in a fire caused by an electrical fault at a club on the holiday island of Phuket, a magnet for foreign tourists, in 2012.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113449657']

After a grinding year that has seen at least 1.7 million people die from Covid-19, fresh waves of infection have sparked renewed lockdowns and forced would-be revellers to extend their 2020 tradition of watching events from the sofa.  The eagerly awaited first seconds of 2021 fell on the Pacific nations of Kiribati and Samoa from 1000 GMT. The uninhabited Howland and Baker Islands will be the last to tip over into the New Year.  New Zealand, which has won plaudits for its handling of the coronavirus, followed Kiribati and Samoa, with large crowds gathered in Auckland to watch a fireworks display.  In Australia's largest city, Sydney, fireworks lit up the glittering harbour with a dazzling display, but few spectators watched in person.  ""I think everybody is looking towards 2021 as a fresh beginning and a fresh start,"" Karen Roberts, among the lucky few who were allowed past checkpoints around the area, told AFP at a bar nestled under the Sydney Opera House.    - Curfews being enforced -     Some Hong Kongers, despite restrictions, ventured out to mark the start of the year, gathering on the Victoria Harbour waterfront to take selfies.  In Tokyo, where residents face the prospect of a state of emergency being imposed after infections touched new highs, people queued in face masks to offer New Year prayers.  Wuhan in China, where the virus first appeared late last year, saw thousands gather to celebrate -- and Taipei also enjoyed a more traditionally upbeat celebration with crowds massing to watch fireworks.  Elsewhere, the mood was far more downbeat.  In Russia, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged in a New Year's address that a second wave of Covid-19 was battering the nation.  ""The fight against it does not stop for a minute,"" he said.  Italy -- where shocking images of makeshift morgues and exhausted medics awoke the world to the severity of the crisis -- is on a nationwide lockdown until January 7 with a 10 pm curfew in place.  From France to Latvia and Brazil, police and -- in some cases -- military personnel are being deployed to make sure curfews or bans on large gatherings are enforced.  Paris and Athens both featured socially distanced gatherings, with a virtual concert and light show over Notre Dame in the French capital and fireworks over the Acropolis in Greece.  In hard-hit London, 74-year-old American singer-songwriter Patti Smith had been due to ring in the New Year with a tribute to National Health Service workers who have died from Covid-19, projected on the screen at Piccadilly Circus and streamed on YouTube.  But due to alarm at rising infections rates, the big screen projection was cancelled with the tribute viewable instead solely online.  A few dozen revellers did arrive in Parliament Square to watch Big Ben chime 11:00 pm -- midnight in Brussels -- marking the moment that Brexit finally became a reality, with Britain severing its turbulent half-century partnership with Europe.  Police ordered them home well before midnight, however.     - Social gathering -    A fireworks and laser show was held in Dubai at the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, where there has been a slew of new cases. Those watching were required to wear masks and register with identifying QR barcodes.  In Beirut, still reeling from an explosion that devastated the city's port in August, authorities were also cutting loose.   A curfew was pushed back to 3 am and bars, restaurants and night clubs allowed to reopen to host large parties.  On the banks of Lake Baikal in Siberia, where temperatures plummet to as low as -35 degrees Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit), around a dozen Russians emerged invigorated after a New Year's Eve ice dip.  The swimmers, known in Russia as ""walruses"", ran several kilometres (miles) through a snowy forest in swimsuits and festive costumes before plunging into the world's largest freshwater lake.  ""It's invigorating. It stings a little!"" Andrei Bugai told AFP.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel used her New Year greeting to warn the coronavirus crisis would extend into 2021 even if vaccines bring some hope, as police clashed with revellers near the Brandenburg gate in Berlin.  As the final hours of 2020 ticked away in the Americas, authorities in New York City blocked public access to Times Square, where thousands usually gather to watch a crystal ball drop at midnight.  A star-studded celebration will still be televised from the square with performances from the likes of Jennifer Lopez and Gloria Gaynor -- but its confetti will fall onto a largely deserted pavement.  With midnight approaching, the US, the worst-hit country in the world, was also nearing 20 million recorded infections and more than 345,000 deaths.  In Brazil -- which has already recorded more than 193,000 Covid-19 deaths, the second-largest number in the world after the US -- Rio de Janeiro was blocking beach access to prevent the crowds of revellers who traditionally gather.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104641253']

The year-ahead contract for German electricity reached 995 euros ($995) per megawatt hours while the French equivalent surged past 1,100 euros -- a more than tenfold increase in both countries from last year.  In Britain, energy regulator Ofgem said it would increase the electricity and gas price cap almost twofold from October 1 to an average £3,549 ($4,197) per year.  Ofgem blamed the increase on the spike in global wholesale gas prices after the lifting of Covid restrictions and Russian curbs on supplies.  The Czech Republic, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, announced Friday that it would convene an EU energy crisis summit ""at the earliest possible date"".  Energy prices have soared in Europe as Russia has slashed natural gas supplies to the continent, with fears of more drastic cuts in the winter amid tensions between Moscow and the West over the war.  One-fifth of European electricity is generated by gas-fired power plants, so drops in supply inevitably lead to higher prices.  European gas prices on Friday reached 341 euros per MWh, near the all-time high of 345 euros it struck in March.  The war is not the only culprit in France.  The shutdown of several nuclear reactors due to corrosion issues has contributed to the French electricity price increase as power production has dramatically decreased in the country.  Only 24 of the 56 reactors operated by energy giant EDF were online on Thursday.  France, which traditionally exports electricity, is now an importer.  ""Winter is going to be a tough period for all the countries in Europe,"" Giovanni Sgaravatti, research assistant at the Bruegl think tank in Brussels, told AFP.  ""Prices will stay high, possibly they can even go higher,"" he said.    - Recession 'probably unavoidable' -    A Bruegel study found that European Union countries have allocated 236 billion euros from September 2021 to August 2022 to shield households and firms from rising energy prices, which began to increase as countries emerged from Covid restrictions and soared after the war.  In recent days and weeks, countries have announced energy savings campaigns to encourage the public to reduce power consumption during the winter.  Germany announced Wednesday that the temperature of public administrative offices this winter would be capped at 19 degrees Celsius (66 degrees Fahrenheit) while hot water would be shut off.  The German measures also include a ban on heating private swimming pools from September and over the six months that the decree is in place.  Finland is encouraging its citizens to lower their thermostats, take shorter showers and spend less time in saunas, a national tradition.  French households are shielded by an energy price cap until December 31 for now.  Industries are also affected by the soaring energy prices.  Factories that produce ammonia -- an ingredient to make fertiliser -- announced the suspension of their operations in Poland, Italy, Hungary and Norway this week.  HSBC bank warned in a note that ""recession is probably unavoidable"" in the eurozone, with the economy shrinking in the fourth quarter and the first three months of 2023.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

The European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell meanwhile told reporters in Spain that the bloc was considering military training for Ukraine's forces.  General Valeriy Zaluzhny, Ukraine's commander-in-chief, said Ukraine's children needed particular attention ""because their fathers have gone to the front and are maybe among the nearly 9,000 heroes who have been killed"".  Zaluzhny's comments on the Ukrainian death toll, reported by Interfax-Ukraine news agency, were the first indication of Kyiv's military losses since April.  On Wednesday, Ukraine will mark its independence day -- and six months since Russian troops invaded.  After Ukrainian resistance thwarted an early Russian push on the capital Kyiv, Moscow's forces have focused on gaining ground in the country's east.  The shockwaves of the war are being felt around the world with soaring energy prices and food shortages.    - Buying time? -    A Ukraine presidential adviser told AFP that Russia is trying to coax Ukraine into fresh talks in order to buy time to regroup for a fresh offensive.  For weeks, the Kremlin has been ""trying to convince Ukraine to enter into negotiations"", Mykhaylo Podolyak told AFP.  He suggested this was a ploy to ""freeze the conflict while preserving the status quo in the occupied Ukrainian territories.""  Podolyak said Kyiv believes Moscow does not really want serious peace talks but ""an operation pause for its army"" ahead of a new offensive.  Russia's FSB security services earlier accused Ukraine of being behind a car bombing on Saturday in the outskirts of Moscow that killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of hard-line Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin.  ""The crime was prepared and committed by Ukrainian special services,"" the FSB said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.  Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the ""vile crime"" in a message of condolence to her family.  The FSB statement said the person responsible was a Ukrainian woman born in 1979 who had rented an apartment in the same building where Dugina lived.  After the car bombing, she had fled to EU member Estonia, it added.  Dugin, 60, is an outspoken Russian ultranationalist intellectual who enthusiastically backs Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as did his daughter. Russian media reports suggest Dugina had borrowed her father's car at the last minute.  Over the weekend, Podolyak denied any Kyiv link to the bombing.    - Tense Independence Day -    In Spain, Borrell told reporters that EU defence ministers would next week discuss launching a major training operation for Ukrainian forces in nearby countries.  ""It seems reasonable that a war that is lasting and looks set to last requires an effort not only in terms of supplies of material,"" Borrell said.  ""I hope it will be approved,"" said Borrell.  All EU member states would have to agree to step up the training that several are already providing Ukraine under bilateral agreements.  EU defence ministers have a two-day meeting in Prague from next Monday.  With much of Europe preparing for fuel shortages as Moscow cuts back its deliveries to the west in response to sanctions, Bulgaria said Monday it was seeking talks with Russia gas giant Gazprom.  The country is almost totally dependent on Russia for natural gas supplies.  ""We obviously have to turn to them,"" said Energy Minister Rosen Hristov.  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned over the weekend that Russia might mark Ukraine's Independence Day by launching a trial of Ukrainian soldiers captured during the siege of Mariupol.  ""This will be the line beyond which no negotiations are possible,"" he warned in Sunday's nightly address.  The capital Kyiv has already announced a ban on public gatherings around public holiday on Wednesday, and the city of Kharkiv, in the east, has declared a curfew.  Also on Monday, soldiers from Ukraine's Azov regiment captured by Russian forces after the battle for Mariupol said they were beaten in captivity.  The soldiers, released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers that were beaten until their bones were broken.

United, Asiana and Japan's two main airlines confirmed they had already suspended operations of 63 planes fitted with the same family of engine which scattered debris over Denver on Saturday.  The US National Transportation and Safety Board is also investigating the incident, in which no one was hurt.   Boeing warned similarly fitted planes should be taken out of service until the Federal Aviation Authority had determined an inspection procedure.   ""While the NTSB investigation is ongoing, we recommended suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines,"" the company said.   Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) said they had respectively grounded 13 and 19 planes using PW4000 engines but had avoided flight cancelations by using other aircraft.  The Japanese transport ministry said it had ordered stricter inspections of the engine after a JAL 777 plane flying from Haneda to Naha experienced trouble with ""an engine in the same family"" in December.  United said it had voluntarily removed 24 Boeing 777 planes from service and expected ""only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.""  South Korea's transport ministry said it had no immediate plans to ground planes, adding it was monitoring the situation.  But Asiana Airlines, the country's second-largest carrier, said it would not fly any of its seven currently operational 777s.   ""We are still waiting for instructions from South Korea's transport ministry on inspections but we are taking preemptive measures by gradually switching aircraft,"" a spokesman said.  Flag carrier Korean Air added it was awaiting an official directive from South Korean regulators ""and will follow the directions once confirmed"".    The FAA earlier ordered extra inspections of some passenger jets.   Steve Dickson, the head of the regulator, said he had consulted with experts and that some airplanes would ""likely"" be removed from service.  ""I have directed them to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines,"" he said in a statement.  Dickson added that a preliminary safety data review pointed to a need for additional checks of the jet engine's fan blades, which were unique to the engine model and only used on 777 planes.   Officials from the FAA were meeting with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing representatives on Sunday evening, he added.    - Fresh blow for Boeing -    Flight UA328 had been headed from Denver to Honolulu when it experienced an engine failure shortly after departure.   Residents in the Denver suburb of Broomfield found large pieces of the plane scattered around their community.  No one onboard or on the ground was injured.   But the engine failure marks a fresh blow for Boeing after several high-profile aviation accidents.  The manufacturer's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after 346 people died in two crashes -- the 2019 Lion Air disaster in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash the following year.  Investigators said a main cause of both crashes was a faulty flight handling system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.  Boeing was forced to revamp the system and implement new pilot training protocols.  The 737 MAX was a big hit with airlines, becoming Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft until its grounding, which has now been lifted.   After the Covid-19 crisis decimated demand, airlines canceled hundreds of orders for the plane.  wat-to-slb/oho   BOEING    JAPAN AIRLINES    ANA HOLDINGS",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105612231']

Preliminary results broadcast by local media indicate that Deputy President William Ruto and Raila Odinga, the veteran opposition leader now backed by the ruling party, are neck-and-neck, raising the likelihood of a challenge by the losing candidate.  No presidential poll outcome has gone uncontested in Kenya since 2002, and the disputes have led to bloodshed in the past, either involving ethnic clashes or police violence.  The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is under pressure to deliver a free and fair poll after 2017 presidential vote was annulled due to irregularities in the counting process and mismanagement by the election body.   But with the complex process of verifying and tallying votes expected to take days, social media is swamped with disinformation about the results, with rights campaigners and civil society groups accusing both candidates' camps of sharing misleading posts.  Observers from the Commonwealth warned on Thursday that the delay in releasing the results was allowing disinformation to spread rapidly online.  ""The time lag between the announcement of the official results by the IEBC and the provisional, and at times conflicting, results announced by the media is an area of concern,"" Bruce Golding, chairman of the Commonwealth Observer Group, told a press conference in Nairobi.  - 'Need trust in the system' -    At a separate briefing, observers from the United States also voiced concern about misinformation spreading as the counting process entered its third day.  ""It is important that there is timely and accurate information and that all the citizens have access to that information,"" said Donna Brazile of the National Democratic Institute.  ""It is about the citizens having trust in the system and that is working properly. It is not about the continuation of campaigns -- campaigns have ended, and results must be tabulated accurately to ensure confidence in the system.""  The remarks echoed concerns shared by Amnesty International and several Kenyan civil society groups on Wednesday about ""rising levels of false or misleading information"" being shared on social media.  They said in a statement that several posts by candidates and their supporters in the rival camps had ""intentionally sought to misinform the electorate and the public"" on the electoral process and election results.  ""These include distortion, false information shared without malicious intent (misinformation) and those shared to deliberately deceive people (disinformation).""  Kenyans voted in six elections on Tuesday, choosing a new president as well as senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials in polls that were largely peaceful.  The IEBC has yet to publish a final turnout figure but as of Wednesday, turnout was just over 65 percent.  That compares with a final turnout of 78 percent in the disputed August 2017 election.  Observers from the East African Community (EAC) said the lower turnout, especially among Kenyans aged under 35, was worrying.  ""This should concern everyone that young people are not participating in the process,"" said Jakaya Kikwete, head of the bloc's observation mission.  As economic pressures have mounted in the country of 50 million, with food and fuel costs shooting up, many Kenyans said they were fed up with electing leaders who had done little to ease their troubles.  ""I have voted twice in my life and after the last election I decided I won't even vote because it is a waste of time,"" Ruth Musyoki, 40, told AFP in Nairobi.","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said imports fell to £33 million ($39 million) in June -- the lowest level since records began in 1997.  Notably, there were no imports of fuels from Russia in June for the first time ever.  ""This is a decrease of £499 million (100 percent) compared with the monthly average for the 12 months to February 2022,"" the ONS added in a statement.  Before the Ukraine conflict, Russia was the UK's largest supplier of refined oil in 2021, accounting for 24.1 percent of all imports of the commodity.  It also supplied 5.9 percent of the country's crude oil imports and 4.9 percent of gas imports.  ""As a result of the UK government's ambition to phase out imports of Russian oil and gas, there were no imports of refined oil, crude oil, gas or coal, coke and briquettes from Russia by June 2022.  ""This has prompted importers to seek alternatives,"" it added.  Increases in imports of refined oil from Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Belgium and Kuwait have been seen in recent months to compensate, the ONS said.  As well as the phase-out of oil imports by the end of this year, the government in London has targeted sanctions of imports of a range of goods from Russia.  Bans are in place on all iron and steel products, silver, gold, wood products and high-end goods while some goods have been slapped with an additional 35-percent import tariff.  As a result, imports of all commodities decreased compared with the monthly average before the invasion.  Exports increased slightly in June but dropped nearly 70 percent (£168 million) compared with the monthly average for the 12 months to February.  Chemicals were the only commodity exported to Russia that increased in June, driven by medicinal and pharmaceutical products, which are not subject to sanctions.  ""The economic sanctions applied by the UK government are likely to have driven the decreases in imports from and exports to Russia,"" the ONS noted.

Unrest began the day after the October 4 vote, as losing parties took to the streets to decry large-scale vote-buying campaigns that benefited parties close to then-president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.  By night-time the protests had morphed into clashes with police, with one protester killed as several prominent politicians, including ex-leader Almazbek Atambayev and populist Japarov were freed from jail.    The days that followed saw politicians jostle to fill a power vacuum, with Japarov's supporters the largest of the groups insisting on Jeenbekov's immediate resignation despite authorities cancelling the vote results.  Kyrgyzstan is no stranger to volatility, with revolutions unseating successive presidents in 2005 and 2010.  But the sudden nature of the crisis appeared to take even key ally Russia by surprise.   President Vladimir Putin's Deputy Chief of Staff Dimitry Kozak flew to Bishkek to meet with both Jeenbekov and Japarov.   While the visit was seen as bolstering Jeenbekov's position, he resigned just days later, citing the need to avoid bloodshed as a crowd backing Japarov gathered close to his official residence.  Japarov acted as head of state until November when he stepped down from the post to run in Sunday's presidential vote.    - A referendum as well -    In his first televised address to the nation on October 16, the new acting leader pledged ""a real fight against corruption"" and said that organised crime ""will stop dictating its terms"".  But Japarov's critics fear his main aim is to concentrate power in the style of the strongmen who rule in neighbouring post-Soviet countries Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.   On Sunday Kyrgyzstan is also to choose between a presidential form of government championed by Japarov and parliamentary rule.  While work on the new constitution will continue after the vote, it seems likely the new basic law will allow repeat terms for sitting presidents, which was banned in 2010 to curb authoritarianism.  Japarov quit his executive roles in November after seeing loyal allies installed in key positions and a potential electoral rival -- former premier Omurbek Babanov -- rule himself out of the contest.    Since then, the vote favourite has packed stadiums in campaign rallies across the country, basking in the glow of fawning crowds while failing to attend any of the televised debates between candidates.   During one theatrical appearance in his home region of Issyk-Kul, Japarov was ""blessed"" by seven male elders sporting extravagant national garb.    Earlier this week he took to Facebook to criticise small demonstrations against the referendum in the capital Bishkek.  ""From now on, we must learn to reckon with the people,"" Japarov wrote.   ""If someone does not want this, we will teach them.""   tol-cr/jbr/wai     FACEBOOK",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024']

Just hours after Friday's attack at a literary event in western New York state, the British author had undergone emergency surgery for potentially life-threatening injuries.  But his condition, while still serious, has since shown clear signs of improvement and he no longer requires assisted breathing.  ""He's off the ventilator, so the road to recovery has begun,"" his agent Andrew Wylie said in a statement. ""It will be long; the injuries are severe, but his condition is headed in the right direction.""  The prize-winning writer -- who spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders called for Rushdie's killing over his portrayal of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed in his novel ""The Satanic Verses"" -- was about to be interviewed as part of a lecture series when a man rushed the stage and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and abdomen.  The suspected assailant, 24-year-old Hadi Matar from New Jersey, was wrestled to the ground by staff and other audience members before being taken into police custody.  He was later arraigned in court and pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges. He is scheduled to appear again on August 19.  Rushdie's son said the family was ""extremely relieved"" that his father was breathing unaided and had been able to ""say a few words.""  ""Though his life-changing injuries are severe, his usual feisty and defiant sense of humor remains intact,"" Zafar Rushdie said in a statement.  The event host, who was on stage with Rushdie and was also injured in the attack, said he initially thought it was a practical joke -- until he realized his famous guest was bleeding.  ""It was very difficult to understand. It looked like a sort of bad prank and it didn't have any sense of reality. And then, when there was blood behind him, it became real,"" Henry Reese, his face heavily bandaged, told CNN in an interview.    - Questions surround suspect -    Police and prosecutors have provided scant information about Matar's background or the possible motivation behind the attack.  Matar's family appears to come from the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, though he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.  The 75-year-old Rushdie had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989.  That was when Iran's then-supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a religious decree, or fatwa, ordering Muslims to kill the writer for what he deemed the blasphemous nature of ""The Satanic Verses.""  Rushdie moved to New York two decades ago and became a US citizen in 2016. Despite the continued threat to his life, he was increasingly seen in public -- often without noticeable security.  In an interview given to Germany's Stern magazine days before Friday's attack, he had described how his life had resumed a degree of normality following his relocation from Britain.    - 'Appalled' -    ""Ever since I've been living in America ... really there hasn't been a problem in all that time,"" he said.  The stabbing triggered international outrage from politicians, literary figures and ordinary people.  US President Joe Biden called it a ""vicious"" attack and praised Rushdie for ""his refusal to be intimidated or silenced."" British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled.""  But the attack also drew applause from Islamist hardliners in Iran and Pakistan.  Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon.",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

Navalny aides have called for the new nationwide rallies to demand the opposition leader's release from jail where he is awaiting trial, set to start on February 2.  This week several Navalny associates, including lawyer Lyubov Sobol and his brother Oleg, have been placed under house arrest until late March pending charges for violating coronavirus restrictions by calling people to join protests.  Russian authorities have issued several warnings against participating in the upcoming unauthorised rallies and threatened criminal charges against protesters.  In an unprecedented move police in the capital Moscow announced the closure of seven metro stations and said movement of pedestrians would be limited in the city centre.  Moscow authorities also said that some centrally-located restaurants and shops will close and overground transport will be diverted.  Police detained 44-year-old Navalny at a Moscow airport on January 17 as he arrived from Germany, where he had been recovering from exposure to a Soviet-designed nerve toxin.  A makeshift court at a police station ordered the anti-graft campaigner placed in custody until his trial on charges of violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence.  Sunday's Moscow rally is due to take place outside the headquarters of the Federal Security Service, Russia's main security agency, which Navalny says carried out the near-fatal poisoning attack on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.    - 'Wake them up' -    ""The majority is on our side. Let's wake them up,"" Navalny said on Thursday in a message from Moscow's Matrosskaya Tishina, a high-security detention centre.  Tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets of over 100 cities across the country last Saturday to protest Putin's 20-year-rule.  More than 4,000 demonstrators were detained while authorities launched a series of criminal probes.  Authorities are also targeting online platforms demanding they delete posts with calls for rallies or face fines.  The country's media watchdog said Friday it summoned representatives of several social networks, including Facebook and TikTok, over failing to comply.  Russian authorities have launched probes against Navalny's associates both in Russia and abroad.  The Investigative Committee said Friday that Leonid Volkov, head of Navalny's regional network and who is based in Lithuania, was wanted on charges of calling minors to join unauthorised rallies.  On Saturday, investigators launched a fraud probe into Ukraine-based businessman Alexander Khomenko who they say funded Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation that publishes investigations into the wealth of Russia's political elites.   Its most recent video report alleging Putin was gifted a $1.35 billion property on the Black Sea coast garnered over 100 million views on YouTube becoming Navalny's most-watched investigation.  The Kremlin has denied that the Russian president owns the opulent complex, which according to Navalny features an underground ice hockey arena, a private casino and vineyards.  State television on Friday sought to rebut opposition claims the Black Sea property was a luxurious palace by airing footage of it under construction.  Billionaire Arkady Rotenberg -- Putin's former judo partner who is under Western sanctions -- said Saturday he was the owner of the property and that he was building a hotel there.   acl/wdb/   FACEBOOK    GOOGLE",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105082586']

Flight tracking data showed the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged into a steep dive about four minutes after it left Soekarno-Hatta international airport.  Sixty-two passengers and crew were on board, including 10 children, the nation's transport minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, told reporters.  The suspected crash site is near tourist islands just off the coast of Indonesia's sprawling capital.  The plane took off on Saturday afternoon and a search and rescue operation began with no official results available on Saturday night.  ""We deployed our team, boats and sea riders to the location suspected to be where it went down after losing contact,"" Bambang Suryo Aji, a senior official at the agency, told reporters after nightfall.  Sriwijaya Air flight SJ182 was bound for Pontianak on Indonesia's section of Borneo island, about 90 minutes flying time over the Java Sea.  ""I have four family members on the flight -- my wife and my three children,"" Yaman Zai said as he sobbed at Pontianak airport.  ""They haven't arrived. They're not here,"" he was heard saying as he spoke on his mobile phone.    - Sudden plunge -    Data from FlightRadar24 said the plane reached an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) before dropping suddenly to 250 feet. It then lost contact with air traffic control.  ""Sriwijaya Air flight #SJ182 lost more than 10,000 feet of altitude in less than one minute, about 4 minutes after departure from Jakarta,"" the tracking agency said on its official Twitter account.  Broadcaster Kompas TV quoted local fishermen as saying they had found debris near islands just off the coast of the capital Jakarta, but it could not be immediately confirmed as having belonged to the missing jet.  Authorities and the airline gave no immediate indication as to why the plane suddenly went down.  The budget airline, which has about 19 Boeing jets that fly to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, said only that it was investigating the loss of contact.  In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet slammed into the Java Sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on a routine one-hour flight.  That crash -- and a subsequent fatal flight in Ethiopia -- saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the two deadly crashes.  Indonesia's aviation sector has long suffered from a reputation for poor safety, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.  In 2014, an AirAsia plane crashed with the loss of 162 lives.   Domestic investigators' final report on the AirAsia crash showed a chronically faulty component in a rudder control system, poor maintenance and the pilots' inadequate response were major factors in what was supposed to be a routine flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.  bur-pb-kma/axn   BOEING    AIRASIA BHD",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104759345']

The lobbying group DIGI -- representing Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, TikTok and Redbubble -- committed under the code to a range of actions including labelling false content on their platforms, demoting fake content and prioritising credible sources of information.  They also agreed to suspend or disable offending and fake accounts, including ""bots"" that automatically disseminate information across their platforms.  The measures -- which largely codify existing practices -- are said to target paid and political advertising as well as content shared by users.  ""All signatories commit to safeguards to protect Australians against harm from online disinformation and misinformation, and adopting a range of scalable measures that reduce its spread and visibility,"" the group said in releasing the 29-page code.  The voluntary code was developed in response to an Australian government inquiry into the role of online platforms in the spread of misinformation and disinformation.  The problem became particularly acute during historic bushfires that swept the country in late 2019 and 2020 and during the coronavirus pandemic, when social media platforms were flooded with false information on the origins of the disease and efforts to curb its spread.  The government's Communication and Media Authority (ACMA), which will oversee the code's implementation, said Monday that in 2020 more than two-thirds of Australians expressed concern over the extent of online misinformation.  ""False and misleading news and information online -- like that spread through the 2020 bushfires and the Covid-19 pandemic -- has the potential to cause serious harm to individuals, communities and society,"" it said in a statement.  ACMA chair Nerida O'Loughlin welcomed the code as a ""flexible and proportionate approach"" to the risk of harm posed by misinformation.  Signatories agreed to report to the government on initial compliance with the code by the end of June, and then issue annual reports after that.  Communications Minister Paul Fletcher warned the tech firms Monday that the government would be ""watching carefully"" to ensure they follow through on the measures.  The conservative government's pressure for online companies to act against misinformation coincided with a more controversial campaign to force the biggest of them -- Facebook and Google -- to pay for news content they show on their platforms.

Last Sunday, Israel approved 780 new settler homes in the occupied West Bank ahead of a poll where Prime Minister Bejamin Netanyahu is expected to face a fierce challenge from right-wing and pro-settler candidate Gideon Saar.  Peace Now said the government had now published tenders for a further 2,112 units in the West Bank and 460 in East Jerusalem, the eastern part of the city annexed by Israel but which the Palestinians hope to make the capital of a future state.  It accused the government of a ""mad scramble to promote as much settlement activity as possible until the last minutes before the change of the administration in Washington.""  ""By doing so, Netanyahu is signaling to the incoming president that he has no intention of giving the new chapter in US-Israel relations even one day of grace, nor serious thought to how to plausibly resolve our conflict with the Palestinians,"" it said in a statement.  All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by much of the international community.   But Trump's administration, breaking with decades of US policy, declared in 2019 that Washington no longer considered settlements as being in breach of international law.   Biden has indicated that his administration will restore Washington's pre-Trump policy of opposing settlement expansion.  Beyond the change in Washington, experts say Netanyahu also has domestic political reasons for pushing settlement expansion.   Electioneering is intensifying ahead of Israel's March 23 poll, in which Netanyahu is expected to face a fierce right-wing challenge from Saar, a defector from the premier's Likud party.   Saar, a prominent pro-settler voice, split with Likud late last year to challenge Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving premier.   ""Prime Minister Netanyahu is once again putting his personal political interests over those of the country,"" Peace Now said.   Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War.  Following years of settlement expansion, there are currently some 450,000 Jews living in the West Bank amid an estimated 2.8 million Palestinians.  Governments worldwide largely see settlements as an obstacle to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   gl/am/rma/jah",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

The warning came as Russia issued a counter-claim saying it targeted soldiers and killed 200 Ukrainian servicemen in the attack Wednesday on a rail hub in Chaplyne city of the Dnipropetrovsk region.   The attack struck six months to the day since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, which was also the day Ukraine celebrates its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union.  On Thursday, state rail operator Ukrainian Railways said the toll had risen overnight from 22 to 25, and included two children with a further 31 people injured.

Putin had failed to account for the ""strong will of Ukrainians to resist"", Johnson said.  ""You defend your right to live in peace, in freedom, and that's why Ukraine will win,"" he added.  Earlier, Zelensky issued his own defiant morning video address, saying: ""We don't care what army you have, we only care about our land. We will fight for it until the end.""  Referring to Russia, he vowed Ukraine ""will not try to find an understanding with terrorists"".  ""Ukraine is the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. ""All 25 regions, without any concession or compromise.""    - Fresh aid -    The US marked the occasion by announcing $3 billion in fresh military aid.  The new funding will help Kyiv acquire more materiel for its armed forces, locked in a grinding war of attrition with Russian troops in the east and south, with neither side advancing significantly.  Johnson unveiled his own £54 million ($64 million) package of aid, including 2,000 ""state-of-the-art drones"" as well as anti-tank munitions.

With Spain still grappling with a third wave of coronavirus infections, the vote in the wealthy northeastern region was held under tight restrictions to reduce the risk of contagion.  With over 90 percent of the votes counted, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists won the most votes but the three separatist parties together were set to get 74 seats in the 135-seat assembly  That is up from 70 seats won in the last election in December 2017, just months after Catalonia's failed secession bid which led to the jailing of several separatist leaders.  The Socialists had 33 seats, up from 17 in the last election when it finished fourth.  But as separatist parties agreed in writing last week not to reach any post-election agreements with Socialist candidate. former health minister Salvador Illa, the party has no path to govern.  Sanchez had hoped the election -- the fifth in the region in a decade -- would end separatist rule in the region which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy.  He fielded Illa as his candidate in the hope that his high profile in the fight against the pandemic would help win votes.  While separatist parties have been deeply divided over strategy since the failed 2017 secession bid, they were not punished by voters and won just over 50 percent of the vote, against 47.5 percent four years ago.  The more moderate ERC got 33 seats, the hardline JxC got 32 and the radical CUP nine seats.    - 'Amnesia' jibe -    The result leaves the ERC's main candidate, Pere Aragones, best placed to become Catalonia's next leader.  Illa had said it was ""time to turn the page"" after over a decade of Catalan nationalists governments focusing on separatism but Aragones dismissed his approach as ""amnesia"".  He said his party would not turn the page while independence leaders remained in jail over the failed secession bid.  Catalonia is currently governed by a coalition led by JxC, which is prone to confrontation with Madrid, and the ERC, which is open to dialogue and has helped Sanchez's minority government pass laws at the national level.  Voters had to wear face masks, use disinfectant gel provided at polling stations and stand apart while lining up in rainy weather to cast their ballots.  To help spread out voters, polling stations were set up in spacious venues such as food markets, the area around FC Barcelona's football stadium and the bullring in Tarragona.  The final hour of voting was reserved for people infected with Covid-19 or in quarantine.     - 'We are afraid' -    The measures appeared to discourage people from voting.  While some 5.5 million people are eligible to vote, turnout stood at 53.5 percent, down from almost 80 percent in the last election.  ""I hesitated until the last minute whether to come vote or not,"" Cristina Caballero, a 34-year-old child educator, told AFP at a Barcelona polling station.  ""I think these elections should have been postponed.""  The regional government tried to put off the election until the end of May because of the pandemic but the courts blocked that move.  While more than 40 percent of the 82,000 people assigned to help staff polling stations on the day had asked to be recused, all polling stations were operating normally as of noon, according to the Catalan government.  Still, some people tapped for polling station duty expressed concern.  ""Of course we are afraid, I just had cancer and am still on sick leave, but I was called up,"" Eva Vizcaino, a 54-year-old office worker, told AFP at a Barcelona polling station.

She felt comfortable in Ukraine, she said, a country ""100 times more democratic"" than her homeland, whose strongman leader has ruled with an iron fist for more than two decades.   The 31-year-old had fled Belarus six weeks earlier for what she expected to be a safe haven because she was facing arrest for anti-government posts.  Some of her friends were already in jail.  But, within only two weeks, on February 24, Moscow had attacked her new home country -- using Belarus as a staging ground.  Patsiomkina and most of the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Belarusians living in Ukraine watched in horror.  Many assisted Ukraine but are now facing mounting administrative challenges that may force them out of the country.  Again, in March Patsiomkina had to move as the battle for Bucha raged.  The town has since become known around the world for the alleged war crimes carried out by Russian occupiers there.  Patsiomkina and her flatmate decided to leave on March 8 after the gas and electricity were cut.  After a 48-hour trip to Kyiv -- a journey that pre-war would have only taken around an hour -- she spent her last pennies on getting to the western city of Lviv.  As soon as she heard that Bucha had been liberated and that evidence of mass atrocities was emerging, she rushed back and volunteered with a psychological support centre and the Red Cross.  She received an official thank you for her work from Bucha city hall in June.  But, a few days later, when she showed up at migration services to extend her residency permit that had just expired, her passport was confiscated.  It was given back to her with a stamp saying she had to leave the country within 10 days, or she would be expelled.     - 'Massive refusals' -    Many similar cases have come to light, with applicants saying they are given no reasonable explanation for refusals.  A Kyiv-based NGO helping Belarusian political refugees called Free Belarus Centre and other human rights groups have pointed to ""massive refusals"" to issue or extend residency permits.  The refusals are particularly surprising given Kyiv officially says it has not changed its policy towards Belarusian citizens.  Political refugees for the most part, they have mobilised massively to help defend Ukraine.  The 175,000 Russian citizens living in Ukraine -- according to numbers from the Ukrainian interior ministry -- face the same hurdles.  Asked about these claims, Ukraine's migration agency did not immediately comment.  Andrei Sidorkin, a 41-year-old musician and producer, has been living in Ukraine for 17 years.  He was about to get Ukrainian citizenship when the war started.  When he asked for a new residency permit, he was refused.  ""Migration services are refusing to reconsider their decisions,"" Sidorkin told AFP.  Without knowing if it would lead to anything, he still brought his case to court.   In any case, going back to Russia is ""out of the question!"" he said.   ""There's nothing for me there. And I'd be facing 15-20 years in prison,"" he said, referring to his support for the Ukrainian war effort.  He was not accepted into the Ukrainian army when he tried to join at the start of the invasion but has been making molotov cocktails and helping evacuate artwork from museums in Kyiv.      - 'No one needs us' -    On the ""Russians in Ukraine"" chat created on messaging-app Telegram in March, some 1,300 subscribers have been expressing their fears and voicing complaints.  Group moderator Yevgenia, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that ""no one has been expelled yet"" from Ukraine.  But she said that there have been issues ""particularly in small cities near the front lines.""  As for Patsiomkina, the Bucha municipality eventually helped her get her deportation order overturned.  But she is not allowed to work and is stuck in an administrative limbo.   Her patience is running out.  ""We Belarusians have become nobodies, no one needs us,"" she cried, tears running down her cheeks.   ""But we have the same enemy. And we need to fight against that enemy, not run away from it!""  tbm/brw/dt/kjm",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

Sadyr Japarov's journey from prison to presidential frontrunner is an example of the dramatic changes in political fortunes in the Central Asian country that is both more unpredictable and pluralistic than its authoritarian neighbours.  But critics of combative Japarov, who became acting leader during the October unrest, fear his victory could tip Kyrgyzstan towards the strongman rule dominant in the ex-Soviet region.  Voting began at 8:00 am (0200 GMT) with first results expected shortly after polling stations close at 8:00 pm (1400 GMT).  In the capital Bishkek, where cold winters usher in a thick blanket of smog courtesy of polluting heating systems and ageing transport, many voters said they intended to back Japarov at the ballot box.   ""Of course I am for Japarov,"" said 49-year-old Talant Samatov, who owns a small sewing shop.  He said he believes the 11-year sentence that Japarov received in 2017 for taking a government official hostage was unfair.  ""He experienced deep injustice and now he will become a just leader for us,"" Samatov said.    In addition to picking a new president Kyrgyz are choosing between parliamentary and presidential forms of government, with Japarov backing greater powers for the post he is seeking.    - Crime, corruption -    Japarov, who was sprung from jail by supporters during the crisis before a court overturned his conviction, has styled himself as an uncompromising opponent of organised crime and systemic corruption.  He has poured scorn on critics, some of whom have speculated that criminal networks are behind his rise for power.  But he struck a unifying tone in his last campaign appearance on Friday in Bishkek.  ""Let us come together... treat each other with understanding and respect. We are one country, one people,"" he told a crowd of several thousand people.  With a threadbare economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Kyrgyzstan's next leader is likely to be even more dependent on goodwill from allies Russia -- a destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrants -- and neighbouring economic giant China.  Russian President Vladimir Putin recently described the overthrow of the previous government as a ""misfortune"".  At his end of year press-conference Putin chided Kyrgyz politicians for attempting to imitate Western democracies.  Beijing's ambassador met with Kyrgyz officials several times last year to discuss protection for Chinese businesses, some of which were attacked during the unrest.    - Level playing field? -    Mountainous Kyrgyzstan's votes are more competitive than in its ex-Soviet neighbours, but they have rarely offered an even playing field.  The crisis that allowed for Japarov's overnight rehabilitation and rise to power was sparked by vote-buying campaigns favouring parties close to former president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.  Jeenbekov resigned less than two weeks later at the insistence of Japarov's supporters and after agreeing to sign off on Japarov's election as prime minister by parliament.  It was the third time a Kyrgyz head of state has stepped down over street protests since independence in 1991.  While constitutional requirements saw Japarov abandon his positions to compete in Sunday's election, rivals have complained that his campaign has benefited from the resources of the state, where his allies now occupy top posts.   On Friday the national security committee said it was investigating evidence that ""certain presidential candidates and their supporters"" were planning unrest after the vote, but did not name the candidates.  Bekjol Nurmatov, a 77-year-old retiree, accused Japarov of ""plunging the people into chaos"" last year and complained his campaign was using ""administrative resources"" to win votes in the Osh region from which Nurmatov hails.      The pensioner noted that Japarov had failed to show up for televised debates between candidates. He said he would vote instead for presidential rival Adakhan Madumarov, also from the Osh region.   ""Madumarov is a worthy candidate, the retiree said, accusing frontrunner Japarov of ""hiding from the people.""  tol-cr/mtp",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84026024']

But with the race currently too close to call between presidential frontrunners William Ruto and Raila Odinga and what could be a low turnout by Kenyan standards, the risk of yet another contested election is high.  No Kenyan presidential poll outcome has gone unchallenged since 2002, and memories are still raw of the bloodshed that erupted after disputes over two of the last three elections.    - The count -    Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission must announce the results by August 16, but the longer the wait the greater the risk of tensions, analysts say.  ""We call for patience among Kenyans as we undertake this rigorous exercise and also endeavour to complete this exercise as soon as possible,"" IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said late Tuesday.  The process is complicated, with results from more than 46,000 polling stations across the country to be counted, cross-checked and tallied.  In addition to voting for president, Kenyans were also choosing new MPs, senators, women representatives as well as county governors and officials.   Final presidential results will be announced at the IEBC's national tallying centre, based at a tourist village known as the Bomas of Kenya.  It has been transformed into a virtual fortress, with no one admitted without accreditation and armed guards and sniffer dogs ensuring security.  The winner of the presidential race needs to secure 50 percent plus one vote and at least a quarter of the votes in 24 of the 47 counties.  If neither Odinga nor Ruto gets over the threshold, a run-off must be held within 30 days of the original election -- something that would be a first in Kenyan history.    - Court petition -    Any challenge to the results must be made within seven days to the Supreme Court, the country's highest judicial body.     The court has a 14-day deadline to issue a ruling, and if it orders an annulment, a new vote must be held within 60 days.  If no candidate files a petition, the winner takes office two weeks after final results are announced.   One scenario, albeit seen as the most unlikely, suggested that if there were multiple run-offs and petitions, there may not be a new president until late April or early May next year.  Ben Hunter, Africa analyst at risk intelligence group Verisk Maplecroft, said the court system in Kenya was one of the region's most ""robust"".  ""If the result is contested, a candidate filing a petition with the Supreme Court would be a positive step because the alternative is calling supporters out in protest.   ""The court enjoys strong credibility and a legal process would act as a release valve for political tensions.""  The African Union, the European Union and the Commonwealth are among those that have sent observers to monitor the polls, along with several civil society groups.    - Past disputes -    Odinga, 77, ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1997, 2007, 2013 and 2017, claiming to have been robbed of victory in the last three elections.   In a first for Africa, the Supreme Court annulled the August 2017 result after Odinga rejected the results, saying hackers broke into the electoral body's database.  The court declared President Uhuru Kenyatta's win null and void because of widespread ""irregularities and illegalities"" in the counting process and mismanagement by the IEBC.  Dozens of people were killed in what was blamed on police brutality in the chaos and acrimony that followed.  Kenyatta went on to win the rematch after a boycott by Odinga.  In the deadliest election violence, more than 1,100 people were killed and many thousands more displaced in bloodletting between rival tribes after the 2007 vote.  The clashes erupted after Odinga claimed incumbent Mwai Kibaki's victory had been rigged.  Ruto and Kenyatta were charged by the International Criminal Court over the unrest but the cases were later dropped.  txw/amu/ah","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

""It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,"" Biden said in somber, brief remarks near the edge of the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial.  ""Let us shine the lights in the darkness along the sacred pool of reflection and remember all who we have lost,"" the 78-year-old Democrat said as 400 lights lining the water were turned on as a memorial to those who have died.  Church bells pealed across Washington, while lights on New Yorks' Empire State Building glowed red, resembling a beating heart.  Biden, who himself has suffered deep personal tragedy of his own and who is known for his empathy, has stressed the need to unite the nation after the chaos of outgoing President Donald Trump's four years in office.  Inauguration eve is normally a time of massive crowds in Washington.   But Biden, joined by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, visited the reflecting pool under the extraordinary sight of a National Mall virtually empty of people, thanks to Covid-related social gathering restrictions and heightened security alerts in the wake of the deadly riot at the US Capitol on January 6.  On the Mall's grassy expanse, instead of crowds of well-wishers there are thousands of US flags and those of the nation's 50 states, placed to honor the people who can not be in Washington for the inauguration.  ""For many months, we have grieved by ourselves. Tonight, we grieve and begin healing together,"" Harris -- who makes history as the country's first female vice president -- said at the brief reflecting pool ceremony.  ""Though we may be physically separated, we the American people are united in spirit.""  Earlier in the afternoon Biden offered a tearful farewell to residents of his home state of Delaware before flying to the city where he served for decades as a senator, then for eight years as vice president.  mlm/jh",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

Polls point to a first-round win for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator turned approachable head of state known for candid moments like queueing at the supermarket in shorts, plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized or sharing a meal with homeless people.  But observers have their eye on how a far-right challenger will perform -- and whether a plunge in turnout could produce an upset.  At stake is a post with the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power.  Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at braking a surge in coronavirus cases.  The country recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll and number of new infections on Saturday bringing fatalities to over 10,000.  More than 80,000 infections were reported in the past week to Friday, the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its 10.8 million people, according to an AFP tally based on government figures.  Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants.    - Keep it to one round -    In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa -- one of the rare politicians often referred to simply by his first name -- urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round.  That would ""spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks"" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said.  ""An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable,"" the 72-year-old warned.  Lower turnout could also upset the expected easy win for Rebelo de Sousa, with polls giving him 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of socialist challenger Ana Gomes and far-right populist Andre Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent.  A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way.  Nevertheless, in a long political career ""I've seen more failures than victories, so I keep things in perspective"", ""Marcelo"" said recently when asked if he hadn't been campaigning hard enough.  ""When I lost it wasn't the end of the world. And when I won, I didn't think I was the best.""    - Far-right challenge -    Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government.  He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist.  Meanwhile Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- ""Enough"" -- says he is in the running to ""crush the Left"", which is fielding three out of the seven candidates.  Portugal has so far been largely spared the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years.  Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.  tsb/tgb/har",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48861733']

On Sunday, Israel approved 780 new settler homes in the West Bank ahead of a March poll where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to face a fierce challenge from right-wing and pro-settler candidate Gideon Saar.  Peace Now said the government had now published tenders for a further 2,112 units in the West Bank and 460 in East Jerusalem, the eastern part of the city annexed by Israel but which the Palestinians hope to make the capital of a future state.  It accused the government of a ""mad scramble to promote as much settlement activity as possible until the last minutes before the change of the administration in Washington.""  ""By doing so, Netanyahu is signalling to the incoming president that he has no intention of giving the new chapter in US-Israel relations even one day of grace, nor serious thought to how to plausibly resolve our conflict with the Palestinians,"" it said in a statement.  All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by much of the international community.   But Trump's administration, breaking with decades of US policy, declared in late 2019 that Washington no longer considered settlements as being in breach of international law.   Biden has indicated that his administration will restore Washington's pre-Trump policy of opposing settlement expansion.  But on Tuesday his nominee for secretary of state, said the incoming administration will not reverse Trump's landmark recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  ""The only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,"" Antony Blinken said.    - Electioneering -  Beyond the change in Washington, experts say Netanyahu also has domestic political reasons for pushing settlement expansion.   Electioneering is intensifying ahead of Israel's March 23 poll, in which Netanyahu is expected to face a challenge from right-wing candidate Gideon Saar, a defector from the premier's Likud party.   Saar, a prominent pro-settler voice, split with Likud late last year to challenge Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving premier.   Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War and has increasingly expanded the size and number of settlements there, notably under Netanyahu's leadership since 2009.  There are currently some 450,000 Jews living in the West Bank amid an estimated 2.8 million Palestinians.  Governments worldwide largely see settlements as an obstacle to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   gl/am/rma/jfx",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104889772']

Emergency workers have been trying to clear the debris of a gun and bomb attack by the Al-Qaeda-linked group on the popular Hayat hotel which left parts of the building in ruins, with many feared trapped inside the venue.  ""The ministry of health has so far confirmed the deaths of 21 people and 117 people wounded"" in the assault that began on Friday evening and lasted over a day, Adan said.   On Sunday morning, the area surrounding the hotel was quiet and the roads blocked by a heavy security presence as emergency workers and bomb disposal experts sought to clear the premises of any explosives and remove rubble.  The hotel building sustained heavy damage during the gunfight between Somali forces and the insurgent.  It caused some parts of it to collapse and leaving many people frantically searching for their loved ones who were inside when the attack began.  Police commissioner Abdi Hassan Mohamed Hijar told reporters on Sunday that ""106 people including children and women"" were rescued by security forces during the siege which ended around midnight.  As bullets and flames ripped through the hotel, security forces searched the property to bring civilians to safety, including three young children who hid inside a toilet.  ""The casualties mostly happened in the early hours of the attack, after that security forces spent time rescuing people individually and room by room,"" Hijar said.  The attack was the biggest in Mogadishu since Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud took office in June, and underscored the challenge of trying to crush the 15-year insurrection by the Islamist group.    - 'Tense' -    Dozens of people gathered near the road leading up to the hotel on Sunday morning, desperate for news of their family members as security forces guarded the area, not letting anyone through.  Businessman Muktar Adan, whose brother was inside the hotel when the attack started, told AFP he was waiting for permission to enter the premises and look for his sibling.  ""My brother was inside the hotel the last time we heard from him, but his phone is switched off now and we don't know what to expect,"" he said.  Said Nurow, who heard the attack unfold, said he was very worried about his friend who was a guest at the property.  ""I hope... (he) is alive, he stayed in the hotel according to the last information we got from his sister,"" he told AFP, describing the mood as ""tense"".  The hotel was a favoured meeting spot for government officials and scores of people were inside when gunmen stormed the property.   Somalia's allies, including the United States, Britain and Turkey, as well as the UN, have strongly condemned the attack. So did ATMIS, the African Union force tasked with helping Somali forces take over primary responsibility for security by the end of 2024.  Earlier this month, Washington announced its forces had killed 13 Al-Shabaab operatives in an air strike, the latest since President Joe Biden ordered the re-establishment of a US troop presence in Somalia, reversing a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump.    - Twin explosions -    Mohamud said last month that ending the jihadist insurrection required more than a military approach, but that his government would negotiate with the group only when the time was right.  According to police, the attack began with a blast caused by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the hotel along with gunmen.  Minutes later, a second explosion struck as rescuers, security forces and civilians rushed to help the injured, witnesses said.  Al-Shabaab spokesman Abdiaziz Abu-Musab told the group's Andalus radio earlier Saturday that its forces had ""inflicted heavy casualties"".  Al-Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Somalia since Mohamud took office, and last month launched strikes on the Ethiopian border.  The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, but still control swathes of countryside and retain the ability to launch deadly strikes, often targeting hotels and restaurants.  The deadliest attack occurred in October 2017 when a truck packed with explosives blew up in Mogadishu, killing 512 people.  str-amu/ach/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113568279']

The blaze, blamed on an electrical fault, hit the Abu Sifin church in densely populated Imbaba, a working class district west of the Nile River, part of Giza governorate in greater Cairo.   Witnesses described panicked scenes as people rushed into the multi-storey house of worship to rescue those trapped but were soon overwhelmed by the heat and deadly smoke.   ""Everyone was carrying kids out of the building,"" said Ahmed Reda Baioumy, who lives next to the church. ""But the fire was getting bigger and you could only go in once or you would asphyxiate.""  Another witness, Sayed Tawfik, told AFP that ""some threw themselves out of windows to escape the fire."" He pointed to a car bearing dents ""left by a person who is now lying in the hospital with a broken arm and back.""  A resident of the area, Mina Masry, said emergency services were slow in responding. Ambulances took ""over an hour to arrive"" and fire trucks ""nearly an hour, though their station is five minutes away.""  Masry added: ""If the ambulances had come on time, they could have rescued people.""   The Egyptian Coptic Church and the health ministry reported 41 dead and 14 injured in the blaze before emergency services said they had brought the blaze under control.  Copts are the largest Christian community in the Middle East, making up at least 10 million of Egypt's 103 million Muslim-majority population.    - Power surge -    The interior ministry said ""forensic evidence revealed that the blaze broke out in an air-conditioning unit on the second floor of the church building"" which also houses social services.  Father Farid Fahmy, of another nearby church in Imbaba, told AFP a short circuit caused the fire.  ""The power was out and they were using a generator,"" he said. ""When the power came back, it caused an overload.""  In the morning, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on his Facebook page that he had ""mobilised all state services"" in response. He later said he had ""presented his condolences by phone"" to Pope Tawadros II, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church.  The Giza governor ordered ""urgent aid of 50,000 pounds (around $2,600) for the families of the deceased and 10,000 pounds for the injured"".  The grand imam of Al-Azhar, Egypt's foremost Muslim institution, expressed his condolences for ""the tragic accident"" and affirmed ""the readiness of Al-Azhar hospitals to receive the injured"".  Accidental fires are not uncommon in the sprawling megalopolis of Cairo, where millions live in informal settlements.   Baioumy, the neighbour, told AFP that firefighters were hampered by the church's location ""on a very narrow street"".  Egypt, with its often dilapidated and poorly maintained infrastructure, has suffered several deadly fires in recent years.  In March 2021, at least 20 people died in a blaze at a textile factory in an eastern suburb of Cairo.   In 2020, two hospital fires claimed the lives of 14 Covid-19 patients.  Last Monday a church caught fire in the eastern Cairo district of Heliopolis, though no deaths or injuries were reported.    - Religious minority -    The Coptic minority has suffered attacks and complained of discrimination in the north African country, the Arab world's most populous.  Copts have been targeted in deadly attacks by Islamist militants, particularly after Sisi overthrew former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, with churches, schools and homes burnt down.

The British author of ""The Satanic Verses"", which sparked fury among some Muslims who believed it was blasphemous, had to be airlifted to hospital for emergency surgery following the attack.  His agent said in a statement obtained by The New York Times that ""the news is not good.""  ""Salman will likely lose one eye; the nerves in his arm were severed; and his liver was stabbed and damaged,"" said agent Andrew Wylie, who added that Rushdie could not speak.  Carl LeVan, an American University politics professor attending the literary event, told AFP that the assailant had rushed onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and ""stabbed him repeatedly and viciously.""  Several people ran to the stage and took the suspect to the ground before a trooper present at the event arrested him. A doctor in the audience administered medical care until emergency first responders arrived.  New York state police identified the suspected attacker as Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old from Fairfield, New Jersey, adding that he stabbed Rushdie in the neck as well as the abdomen.   The motive for the stabbing remains unclear.  An interviewer onstage, 73-year-old Ralph Henry Reese, suffered a facial injury but has been released from hospital, police said.   The attack took place at the Chautauqua Institution, which hosts arts programs in a tranquil lakeside community 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Buffalo city.  ""What many of us witnessed today was a violent expression of hate that shook us to our core,"" the Chautauqua Institution said in a statement.  LeVan, a Chautauqua regular, said the suspect ""was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued,"" adding that he believed the man ""was trying to kill"" Rushdie.  ""There were gasps of horror and panic from the crowd,"" the professor said.    - A decade in hiding -    Rushdie, 75, was propelled into the spotlight with his second novel ""Midnight's Children"" in 1981, which won international praise and Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.  But his 1988 book ""The Satanic Verses"" transformed his life when Iran's first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or religious decree, ordering his killing.  The novel was considered by some Muslims as disrespectful of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed.  Conservative media in Iran hailed Friday's attack on Rushdie, with one state-owned paper saying the ""neck of the devil"" had been ""cut by a razor.""  Ultra-conservative newspaper Kayhan, whose chief is appointed by current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote: ""Bravo to this courageous and duty-conscious man who attacked the apostate and depraved Salman Rushdie in New York.""   Rushdie, who was born in India to non-practicing Muslims and identifies as an atheist, was forced to go underground as a bounty was put on his head.  He was granted police protection by the government in Britain, where he was at school and where he made his home, following the murder or attempted murder of his translators and publishers.  He spent nearly a decade in hiding, moving houses repeatedly and being unable to tell even his children where he lived.  Rushdie only began to emerge from his life on the run in the late 1990s after Iran in 1998 said it would not support his assassination.  Now living in New York, he is an advocate of freedom of speech, notably launching a strong defense of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after its staff were gunned down by Islamists in Paris in 2015.  The magazine had published drawings of Mohammed that drew furious reactions from Muslims worldwide.  Charlie Hebdo said nothing justified the stabbing of Rushdie.  Global leaders voiced anger over the attack, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying the author ""embodied freedom"" and that ""his battle is ours, a universal one.""  British leader Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled,"" sending thoughts to Rushdie's loved ones and praising the author for ""exercising a right we should never cease to defend.""  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called it a ""reprehensible attack,"" adding that ""all of us in the Biden-Harris Administration are praying for his speedy recovery.""       - An 'essential voice' -    Threats and boycotts continue against literary events that Rushdie attends, and his knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 sparked protests in Iran and Pakistan, where a government minister said the honor justified suicide bombings.  The fatwa and other threats failed to stifle Rushdie's writing and inspired his memoir ""Joseph Anton,"" named after his alias while in hiding and written in the third person.  ""Midnight's Children"" -- which runs to more than 600 pages -- has been adapted for the stage and silver screen, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages.  Suzanne Nossel, head of the PEN America organization, said the free speech advocacy group was ""reeling from shock and horror.""  ""Just hours before the attack, on Friday morning, Salman had emailed me to help with placements for Ukrainian writers in need of safe refuge from the grave perils they face,"" Nossel said in a statement.   ""Our thoughts and passions now lie with our dauntless Salman, wishing him a full and speedy recovery. We hope and believe fervently that his essential voice cannot and will not be silenced.""  bur-mdo/md/ssy/ser/axn     THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113503169']

According to family members quoted by Russian media, Dugin -- a vocal supporter of Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine -- was the likely target of the blast as his daughter borrowed his car at the last minute.  Daria Dugina was killed when a bomb placed in the Toyota Land Cruiser went off as she drove on a highway near the village of Bolshie Vyzyomy, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside Moscow, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.  Dugina, a journalist born in 1992 who herself openly supported the offensive, died on the scene and a homicide investigation has been opened, said the committee, which probes major crime cases in Russia.  In July Britain put her on a list of sanctioned Russians for allegedly spreading online disinformation about Ukraine.  Dugin, 60, sometimes called  ""Putin's Rasputin"" or ""Putin's brain,"" is an outspoken Russian ultranationalist intellectual.  He has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking territories in a vast new Russian empire and wholeheartedly supported Moscow's operation in Ukraine.   He was put on a Western sanctions list after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a move he also backed.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.  The head of one of Ukraine's breakaway separatist regions blamed the blast on Kyiv authorities.  ""The Ukrainian regime terrorists tried to liquidate Alexander Dugin, but blew up his daughter,"" DNR chief Denis Pushilin wrote on Telegram.

The senator from the northeastern state of Vermont, beloved by supporters for his earnest and seemingly grumpy style, was seated alone at the socially distanced event Wednesday where Joe Biden took oath as president.  Social media users quickly pounced on AFP photographer Brendan Smialowski's shot of a bundled-up Sanders sitting cross-legged, superimposing it on a wide variety of images.  One placed Sanders on a bench next to Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"", another put him in detention with the teenagers from ""The Breakfast Club"", and he also made it into numerous ""Star Wars"" scenes.  Some photoshopped him on to the covers of albums by music stars such as Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and Oasis.  ""You know, in Vermont... we know something about the cold. We're not so concerned about good fashion, we want to keep warm. And that's what I did today,"" Sanders said with a snicker on CBS News after the inauguration.  His wife Jane O'Meara Sanders also praised the look, tweeting: ""Vermont jacket, Vermont gloves, Vermont common sense!""  Sanders has been in the political limelight for years -- most recently, he aimed for the White House in the 2020 Democratic primaries, which he lost to the eventual winner Biden.  But some Twitter users decided to whisk him to other moments in history.  One meme showed him, mittens and all, in a black-and-white photo from the WWII Yalta Conference in 1945, seated next to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, US President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.  Another placed him at the table with Jesus Christ and his apostles in Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"".  He even made it to the Moon: one meme showed him seated on the surface of the moon, wearing an astronaut's helmet, next to an American flag.  Sanders's prominent mittens were made from repurposed wool sweaters and fleece made from recycled plastic bottles by a teacher in Vermont, according to fashion magazine Vogue, which described his style as ""anti-fashion"".  Sanders, who had arrived at the Capitol carrying a large brown envelope, was also compared to a grandfather stopping in at the inauguration on the way to the post office, or perhaps he was off to pick up a doctor's prescription.

The internet went down on the eve of the vote, with some parts of the country reporting complete disruptions or significant slowdowns, after one of the most violent campaigns in years.  Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, having ruled for almost four decades, against singer-turned-MP Bobi Wine, 38, whose popularity among a youthful population has rattled the former rebel leader.  Wine said several of his party's polling agents had been arrested during the morning, as he cast his vote alongside his wife Barbie, to a crowd of dancing and singing supporters.  ""In 22 districts out teams are on the run because they are being surrounded and pursued by police and soldiers as if they are criminals,"" he said.  In Kampala's Kamwokya slum, where Wine grew up and is hugely popular, voters streamed to a polling station as police enforced social distancing after weeks of surging coronavirus cases in the East African nation.  A group of about two dozen riot officers marched past, with heavy military and police presence in other parts of the capital.  ""I am here to change the leadership of this nation because for years they've been telling me they will secure my future. They have not done that,"" said driver Joseph Nsuduga, 30, one of the first in line to vote.  Some 18 million voters are registered for the presidential and parliamentary vote, and results are expected by Saturday.  - 'Treason' warning -    ""We know that Ugandans have turned out in large numbers to cast their vote. I continue to encourage all Ugandans to turn out and vote,"" Wine said.  He has vowed non-violent street protests should Ugandans feel the election was stolen, and urged them this week to ""stay and protect your vote"", using their phone cameras.  Museveni has warned that using violence to protest the result would amount to ""treason"".  He has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin.  Once hailed for his commitment to good governance, the former rebel leader has crushed any opposition and tweaked the constitution to allow himself to run again and again.  The run-up to polling day was marred by a sustained crackdown on Museveni's rivals and government critics, and unprecedented attacks on the nation's media and human rights defenders.  In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces loyal to Museveni during protests against one of Wine's numerous arrests.  - 'He's brought security' -  The energetic and often genial Museveni is active on social media such as Twitter -- where he released an exercise video to help citizens stay fit during lockdown -- and retains support among voters such as Ceria Makumbi, 52.  ""He has brought security to our country... He built hospitals, roads and brought Uganda to an international standard,"" the businesswoman told AFP.  The US, EU, UN and global rights and democracy groups have raised concerns about the integrity and transparency of the election.  Only one foreign organisation, the African Union (AU), has sent monitors, along with an AU women's group.  On Wednesday, the United States, a major aid donor to Uganda, announced it was cancelling a diplomatic observer mission after too many of its staff were denied permission to monitor the election.  In a statement, US ambassador Natalie Brown warned the refusal meant the election ""will lack the accountability, transparency and confidence"" brought by independent oversight.  On Tuesday, Museveni announced the suspension of social media networks and messaging services like Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp in response to Facebook closing accounts linked to government officials the tech giant said were spreading misinformation.    - Generation gap -    Wine is the strongest of 10 opposition contenders trying to unseat Museveni.  But most observers expect the ageing president and his ruling National Resistance Movement to emerge victorious.  He has never lost an election, and has been counting down the days to victory in confident campaign advertisements, promising to invest more in infrastructure, health and education and build Uganda's economy.  But Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has accused the president of presiding over corruption and failing to deliver jobs.  The population has a median age of just less than 16, and many Ugandans have never known anyone but Museveni in charge.  In Kamwokya, Cate Nabbale, 20, a primary school teacher, voted for the first time.  ""I am so excited... I want to see Uganda growing, things changing,"" she told AFP.  str-np-fb/txw   FACEBOOK    Twitter","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499718', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101499739', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84038364']"

Government representative Jose Manuel Franco told Spain's public television that the blast occurred as a team of workmen were repairing the building's boiler.  Speaking at the scene, Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said an 85-year-old woman had died along with a man whose age was not immediately clear, while the third victim was still ""under the rubble"".  Another 11 people were injured, one of whom was in serious condition. Church sources told AFP it was a recently-ordained priest.   Despite the force of the blast, no one was hurt in the elderly care home next door, nor in an adjacent school where tonnes of rubble fell into the playground while the children were in lessons, city officials said.   Wednesday was the first day that schools reopened after a nine-day closure due to the heaviest snowfall in Madrid in 50 years.  ""This could have been a massive tragedy,"" said Martinez-Almeida.    Along the street, at least 15 cars were badly damaged by the force of the explosion, which gutted most of the six-storey residential building.

""There were people running and a lot of smoke and when I got there, I saw the building's facade had been completely destroyed.""  Franco confirmed it was a ""gas explosion"" and said there were three dead and one missing, indicating the toll could rise further.  Hundreds of police and rescuers filled the streets around the building, which the archdiocese said housed local priests who worked in the area.    - 'Pray there are no victims' -    ""Please pray there are no victims,"" tweeted the Virgin de la Paloma parish church, saying ""one lay person has not been found"".  ""These were the living quarters for the local parish priests. They are being treated by the ambulance crews and out of danger,"" it said.

Nine fire crews and 11 ambulances were dispatched to the scene which was completely closed off to traffic and pedestrians, AFP correspondents said.   Three hours after the explosion occurred, smoke and flames could still be seen emerging from the building as a police helicopter flew overhead, an AFP correspondent said.     - 'Our wall caved in' -    Aerial footage released by police appeared to show that the top four or five floors had been completely blown out, with the blast also bringing down the wall of a building in Puerta de Toledo square, some 50 metres (165 feet) away, he said.   ""Unfortunately we are mourning the death of several people in the explosion on Calle Toledo,"" tweeted Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, offering his condolences to the families of the dead and the injured.   Lola Lopez Bravo was having lunch with her six-year-old son in their nearby home when the blast occurred, bringing down the wall in her apartment.   ""We were eating, suddenly we heard a noise and the wall in front of us started falling on top of us,"" the 44-year-old told AFP.   ""There was a huge hole in the wall and then the rubble started falling so we ran out of the house and went to a neighbour's place.""

Israel has said it was forced to launch a ""pre-emptive"" operation against Islamic Jihad, insisting the group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the Gaza border.  Health authorities in Gaza, a Palestinian enclave controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, said a five-year-old girl was among 12 people killed by the Israeli bombardment. More than 80 others have been wounded.  The Israeli military warned Saturday it was ""preparing for the operation to last a week,"" while the sole power station in Gaza ground to a halt due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed border crossings.    Israel and Islamic Jihad have both confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a key leader of Islamic Jihad, in a Friday strike on a building in the west of Gaza city.   Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. It said the initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a ""declaration of war"" and unleashed a barrage of rockets towards Israel.  Sources within the militant group ruled out a ceasefire soon, with one saying: ""for the movement the focus is on the battlefield,"" while an Israeli military spokesman told AFP that the army is ""not currently holding ceasefire negotiations"".  The rocket fire and Israeli strikes were continuing on Saturday, risking a repeat of an 11-day conflict in May 2021 that devastated Gaza and forced countless Israelis to rush to bomb shelters.  Daily life in the Palestinian enclave has come to a standstill, with streets largely deserted and most shops closed.     - 'Will not shy away' -    Israel's closure of a key goods crossing four days ago resulted in Gaza's power plant shutting down on Saturday, due to a ""fuel shortage,"" a spokesman for the enclave's electricity distributor said.  Diesel for the plant is usually trucked in from Egypt or Israel, which closed its two border crossings with Gaza on Tuesday citing security concerns.  ""Israel isn't interested in a wider conflict in Gaza, but will not shy away from one either,"" Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in a nationally televised address on Friday.   Air raid sirens sounded across southern Israel on Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.  Officials in border areas urged people to stay close to shelters, which have also been opened in the coastal city of Tel Aviv.   Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.   Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by much of the West.  A flare up with Islamic Jihad came in 2019, following Israel's killing of Baha Abu al-Ata, Jabari's predecessor. Hamas did not join the fray in that episode.  Hamas's moves now could prove crucial, with the group facing pressure from some to restore calm in order to improve economic conditions in Gaza.    - Five-year-old girl -    Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza City's main hospital, said medics are facing ""acute shortages of medical supplies"".   On Friday, the health ministry reported ""a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation"" was among those killed.   The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.  Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said Friday ""we are assuming about 15 killed in action"" in Gaza, referring to Palestinian combatants.  Israeli tanks were lined up along the border, after the military said Thursday it was reinforcing its troops.   The measures followed the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, including Bassem al-Saadi, who Israel accuses of orchestrating recent attacks.   Israel on Saturday broadened its operation against Islamic Jihad, announcing the arrest of 19 people it said were members of the group in the occupied West Bank.   Israel has conducted a near relentless wave of often deadly raids inside the West Bank since mid-March in response to lethal attacks on Israeli citizens.   bur-rsc/dwo",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

Kenyans, some of whom lined up before dawn to cast their ballot, voted in six elections on Tuesday, choosing a new president as well as senators, governors, lawmakers, woman representatives and some 1,500 county officials.  But despite the early show of enthusiasm, turnout was markedly lower than in previous years, suggesting that for some Kenyans at least, patience with the political establishment was running out.  In Ruto's Rift Valley stronghold of Eldoret, Anthony Kemboi, a 24-year-old graduate, told AFP voter disillusionment was to blame.  ""People did not turn out... as compared to the past because there have been fake promises"" over the years, he said.  According to the latest IEBC figures, turnout was just over 65 percent, with voting still under way in Wajir county, where a gunfight forced officials to postpone the poll until Wednesday.  That compares with a final turnout of 78 percent in the disputed August 2017 election.  In the lakeside city of Kisumu -- Odinga's bastion -- retired civil servant Koga Edward said younger Kenyans had simply failed to show up.  ""Most of our youth, they are only good at participating in political rallies, but they don't participate in the actual voting process,"" the 65-year-old told AFP.    - 'No longer care' -    ""Personally, I did not even vote because I no longer care,"" said Caroline Mwangi, a 31-year-old waitress in Kenya's capital Nairobi.  Politicians ""tell the same old stories and they do nothing for us,"" she told AFP.  Others said they just wanted the election cycle to end so they could focus on putting food on the table in a country hit by skyrocketing inflation and an unemployment crisis.   ""The election was done yesterday, I am not interested in wasting more time on it,"" Celestine Muoki, a 28-year-old IT specialist, told AFP.  ""Let us move on.""  Gabrielle Lynch, professor of comparative politics at the University of Warwick in England, said the shrinking turnout was a consequence of politicians' tendency to ""promise a lot and then under-deliver"".  ""Many Kenyans are... becoming unfortunately increasingly sceptical about the political class,"" she told AFP.  Few Kenyans expect either Ruto or Odinga to accept the result without a challenge in a country where no presidential election outcome has gone uncontested since 2002.  Once the heir-apparent, Ruto, 55, found himself banished to the sidelines after President Uhuru Kenyatta -- who cannot run again -- joined hands with his former foe Odinga, 77, in a move that stunned the country.  Ruto has since cast himself as the champion of ""hustlers"" trying to survive in a country ruled by ""dynasties"" -- the Kenyatta and Odinga families that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence from Britain in 1963.    - 'Life is very hard' -    With a third of Kenya's population living in poverty, economic pressures weighed on voters even before the war in Ukraine sent the prices of essential goods soaring.  Some observers surmised that the economy could even surpass tribal affiliations as a key motivator for Kenya's 22 million registered voters.  With two other candidates also in the race, Kenya could stage a run-off for the first time in its history, if neither Ruto nor Odinga wins more than 50 percent of the vote.  Kenya's international partners are closely watching the election as a test of its stability in a region blighted by conflict.  Security is tight nationwide, with a view to preventing a repeat of the post-election violence that roiled Kenya after the 2007 and 2017 polls, and schools have been ordered to remain closed until Monday.  In deserted downtown Nairobi, Japeth Kigongi, a 25-year-old shoe shiner, told AFP he couldn't even afford to travel to his home constituency to vote.  ""Life has become very hard,"" he said.  ""Whoever will be chosen, I will back him so long as there's peace.""","['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84034298', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104852988']"

The two-metre-long (six-feet) artwork on the sloped ceiling of a rock shelter in Western Australia's Kimberley region was painted in an early naturalistic style, which often features life-sized renderings of animals, according to research published Monday.   Scientists worked with the local Aboriginal community, who can trace their heritage in the region back tens of thousands of years, to establish the age of original rock artworks, many of them worked and reworked over millennia.       ""The main challenge, globally, in dating ancient paintings is that they very rarely employed a pigment that can be dated with any of the current, quantitative dating techniques,"" lead author Damien Finch, a geochronologist at the University of Melbourne, told AFP.   To get around this the researchers identified a way to work out the age of the painting using ancient mud wasp nests.   Finch and his colleagues found that some of the rock paintings had the remains of these nests -- which can be radiocarbon dated -- above and below the images.  They estimated that the kangaroo painting was between 17,500 and 17,100 years old, the oldest discovered to date.  ""It's important that Indigenous knowledge and stories are not lost and continue to be shared for generations to come,"" said Cissy Gore-Birch, head of the Balanggarra Aboriginal Corporation, in a statement from the University of Western Australia.    - 600 generations ago -    She said partnerships could weave together traditional knowledge with western science, adding that the dating of the oldest known rock shelter painting ""holds a great deal of significance for Aboriginal people and Australians and is an important part of Australia's history.""  In total, the team dated 27 mud wasp nests around 16 different paintings from eight rock shelters, and found that the artworks in this same naturalistic style were produced between around 17,000 and 13,000 years ago.  The images were mostly depictions of animals, including a snake, a lizard-like figure, and three macropods -- marsupials including kangaroos, wallabies and quokkas.   ""This is a significant find as through these initial estimates, we can understand something of the world these ancient artists lived in,"" said Finch in a statement, adding that the environment would have been cooler and drier than today.   ""We can never know what was in the mind of the artist when he/she painted this piece of work more than 600 generations ago, but we do know that the Naturalistic period extended back into the Last Ice Age.""

Officers conducted dawn raids in 13 districts in the city, Istanbul police said in a statement, while operations were continuing to catch 11 other suspects.  At least 1,000 people demonstrated outside Bogazici University's campus on Monday in response to a January 1 presidential decree in which Erdogan appointed Melih Bulu as the public institution's rector.  Bulu ran as a candidate in the 2015 election for Erdogan's ruling party.  Critics claim the appointment was another example of political interference in Turkey's education sector by Erdogan, who assumed the power to appoint rectors after surviving a failed coup in 2016.  Before July 2016, university rectors were appointed through elections.  This is the second time Erdogan has appointed a trustee after his decision in November 2016 also attracted angry reactions and created tensions.   The police accuse the 28 suspects of violating a law on demonstrations and marches, and ""resisting an officer on duty"".  A official at the Istanbul police headquarters said those detained were not students but members of ""extremely marginal leftist"" groups who supported the protests.  The university was known as Robert College when it was established in 1863.  It was handed to Turkey in 1971 and was renamed after the campus location by the Bosphorus river -- ""Bogazici"" in Turkish.

Overnight strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine killed 13 people and injured 11, with five reported to be in a serious condition, regional governor Valentin Reznichenko wrote on Telegram.  ""It was a terrible night,"" he said, urging residents to shelter when they hear air raid sirens.  ""I am asking and begging you... Don't let the Russians kill you,"" he wrote.  A woman died after Russian missiles slammed into a village in the Zaporizhzhia region on Wednesday morning, local governor Oleksandr Starukh wrote on Telegram.  Most of the casualties were in the town of Marganets, just across the Dnipro River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest.  Regional council head Mykola Lukashuk said the strikes had hit a local power line, leaving thousands of people without electricity.    - G7 call over nuclear plant -    Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of recent shelling around the plant, which has six reactors.  Ukraine says Russia has stationed hundreds of troops and stored ammunition at the facility since taking it over on March 4, shortly after starting its invasion.  The tensions have revived memories of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Soviet Ukraine, which killed hundreds of people and spread radioactive contamination over much of Europe.  The Group of Seven industrialised nations condemned Russia's occupation and called on Moscow to immediately hand back full control of the plant.  Ukrainian staff operating the plant must be able to work ""without threats or pressure"" and Russia's control of the plant ""endangers the region"", the G7 foreign ministers said in a statement.  The strikes came a day after major blasts at the Saki airfield, a key military base on the Russian-annexed Crimea peninsula.  Moscow insisted that the explosions were caused by detonating ammunition rather than Ukrainian fire and Ukraine has not claimed responsibility.    - 'There is a lot of shooting' -    Fighting also ground on in eastern Ukraine, where Russian troops are gradually advancing.  Strikes on the city of Bakhmut killed at least six people and injured three others, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram, adding that 12 residential buildings were damaged.  The city of Soledar was under constant shelling, AFP reporters saw, as Russian troops attempted to drive out Ukrainian forces and seize a foothold towards Bakhmut.  The echoes of cluster bombs and artillery bounced off apartment buildings with their windows shattered, while roads were cratered and shops boarded up or destroyed.  The city was shrouded with black and white smoke arising from artillery and air strikes.  Some of those who remain now live underground in cellars ill-suited as bomb shelters.  ""Most have left. It's very scary. There is a lot of shooting,"" said 62-year-old Svitlana Klymenko.  ""I just want to leave to grow old in a normal way, die a normal death, not be killed by a missile.""    - EU ban on Russian coal -    The war has severely hampered grain supply from Ukraine, leading to an international food crisis as it is one of the world's biggest producers.  Some ships have been able to leave Ukrainian ports in recent days after a deal with Russia brokered by the United Nations and Turkey.  The first exports of wheat should start next week under the agreement, top UN official Frederick Kenney said on Wednesday.  The first grain shipment to leave on the Sierra Leone-flagged vessel Razoni departed the Ukrainian port of Odessa on August 1 and had been expected to dock in the Lebanese port of Tripoli at the weekend.  But the Ukrainian embassy said a new buyer for the shipment was being sought after the original Lebanese buyer cancelled the order.  Marine traffic sites showed the Razoni docked in Turkey's Mediterranean port of Mersin, following reports a new buyer had been found for its cargo.  Spain on Wednesday launched a pilot project to import Ukrainian grain by train to avoid blocked maritime routes, with a freight train leaving Madrid for the Polish town of Chelm late on Tuesday.  Western countries have meanwhile imposed increasingly stringent sanctions on Moscow, raising fears that Russia may cut off gas supplies.  EU countries have started putting into place different measures to save energy, with air conditioning curbs coming into force in Spain on Wednesday and Vienna dimming street lighting.  A total EU ban on imports of Russian coal was due to come into force overnight.   bur-imm/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113482948']

The European Union shut its airspace to Russian planes after Moscow invaded Ukraine, forcing anyone who wants to travel to Europe to drive across the border or take a circuitous route using non-Western airlines.  Since Russia's Covid-19 restrictions expired in July, there has been a boom in Russian travellers and a rising backlash in Europe against allowing in Russian tourists while the war continues.  A quick stroll through the carpark at the Helsinki airport revealed dozens if not hundreds of high-end cars with Russian licence plates, including a new Mercedes-Benz S-class sedan and Porsche 911 Turbo S.  ""It boggles me,"" Finnish traveller Jussi Hirvonen said after leaving the garage. ""I wish they weren't here before Ukraine's situation is solved.""   Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told AFP that the Nordic nation has become a ""transit country"" for Russian tourists.  ""Helsinki airport is seeing a lot of Russian tourism at the moment.""    - Finland wants EU decision -    Finland said last week it would limit Russian tourist visas to 10 percent of current volumes as of September 1 due to rising discontent over Russian tourism amid the war in Ukraine.  But Russians continue to enter Finland with visas issued by other EU countries in the Schengen borderless travel area for their journeys.  ""They come here on Schengen visas issued by various different countries and then continue further via Helsinki airport,"" Haavisto said.  According to a survey conducted by the Finnish border guard in August, around two-thirds of Russians crossing Finland's eastern border do so with a Schengen visa issued by a country other than Finland.  ""Hungary, Spain, Italy, Austria, Greece and Spain normally issue visas to Russians, and are generally among the top issuing countries each year,"" border guard official Mert Sasioglu told AFP.  Schengen rules do not allow Finland to close the border to specific nationalities, Haavisto said. Such sanctions can only be decided jointly by the EU.  ""As Finland and the Baltic countries are planning to restrict these visas, it would be good if all EU countries took similar decisions,"" Haavisto said.  This sentiment was shared by many Finns at the airport.  ""There should be an EU decision to close the border,"" said Finnish traveller Jussi Hirvonen.  Finland intends to raise the issue at the next meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers in the Czech Republic on August 30.    - 'Everybody should travel' -    After Russia lifted its Covid travel restrictions on July 15, the number of Russian tourists heading to Finland has surged.  While the numbers are still well below pre-Covid levels, there were more than 230,000 border crossings in July -- up from 125,000 in June.  For many Russian travellers, the idea of not being able to travel to Europe is met with disappointment.  ""Everybody should travel, because when you see how other peaceful countries live then you become more peaceful too,"" said Pavel Alekhin, a 32-year-old Russian professional athlete on his way to a bike festival in Basel.  Russian traveller Vadim wan der Berg said the situation is ""very difficult"" for normal Russians, as many now lack the opportunity to fly for work or studies.  ""We're all waiting for this to stop and want a normal situation in the whole world, in our country and Ukraine too.""    - Europe divided -    The European Commission acknowledged last week that discussions were underway to see if a ""coordinated approach"" on Russian visas could be reached.  Eastern EU countries Latvia, Lithuania and Poland stopped issuing new tourist visas to Russians shortly after the war started.  Estonia has gone a step further and is looking at stopping Russians who have visas delivered by other EU states.  But German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed reservations about such restrictions.  ""This is not the Russian people's war, it is Putin's war,"" Scholz noted.  He said limiting tourist visas would also penalise ""all the people who flee Russia because they disagree with the Russian regime"".  ehu/po/rl/lth",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113990504']

Six children are among the dead since the conflict began Friday, while 275 people have been wounded, said health authorities in the enclave where several buildings were reduced to rubble.  The fighting is the worst in Gaza since an 11-day war last year devastated the impoverished coastal territory, home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, and forced Israelis to seek shelter from rockets.  Israel pressed on with an intense aerial and artillery bombardment of positions of Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed group designated as a terrorist organisation by several Western nations, with the group firing hundreds of rockets in return since Friday.  ""I hear the bombing now,"" Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director general of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, told AFP. ""Every minute we receive injured people.""  Salmiya said that medics were treating wounded people in a ""very bad condition"", warning of dire shortages of drugs and fuel to run power generators.

In Gaza, run by the Islamist group Hamas, the health ministry said 31 people had been killed.  Israel said it had ""irrefutable"" evidence that a stray rocket fired by Islamic Jihad was responsible for the deaths of several children in Gaza's northern Jabalia area on Saturday.  It was not immediately clear how many children were killed there, but an AFP photographer saw six dead bodies at the local hospital including three minors.  ""We came running to the place and found body parts lying on the ground... they were torn-apart children,"" said Muhammad Abu Sadaa, describing the devastation in Jabalia.   The army said it had struck 139 Islamic Jihad positions, with the militants firing 470 rockets that had crossed into Israel, while another 115 rockets fired from Gaza fell inside the enclave.  Al Quds Brigades, the Islamic Jihad's military wing, said it had ""fired rockets"" at Jerusalem for the first time in this round of violence.  Sirens wailed and explosions were heard as the army shot the projectiles down.  Amid the high tensions, Jews in Israel-annexed east Jerusalem marked the Tisha Be'av fasting day Sunday at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, known in Judaism as the Temple Mount.

Israel's Lapid called the killing of Mansour an ""extraordinary achievement"".    - 'Killing and wounding' -    Daily life in the Gaza Strip has come to a standstill, with the sole power station shut down due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings.  Gaza's health ministry said Sunday it only had enough fuel for its power generators to last two days before vital services would be cut.  The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA has warned of the ""severe risk"" to the ""continuation of basic essential services"".  ""Each day we wake up to child and women martyrs... there is killing and wounding and people displaced,"" said Gaza City resident Abu Mohammed al-Madhoun, 56. ""We hope that Israeli aggression will end"".  Civilians in southern and central Israel, meanwhile, were forced into air raid shelters, with two people hospitalised with shrapnel wounds and 13 others lightly hurt while running for safety, the Magen David Adom emergency service said.  ""It's tense, it's frightening,"" said Beverly Jamil, a resident of Ashkelon close to Gaza.  ""Ashkelon's a ghost town -- it's a holiday, kids should be out playing.""  Meanwhile, Hamas's response to the violence remains critical, with spokesman Fawzi Barhoum offering the group's support to Islamic Jihad on Sunday, but stopping short of saying they would take part.  ""The resistance in all its military wings and factions are united in this battle,"" Barhoum said.  Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas but often acts independently. Hamas has fought four wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007, including the conflict last May.  bur-pjm/fz",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

An Egyptian security source told AFP in Gaza that Cairo's mediation efforts had been ongoing since Friday when Israel launched attacks on what it described as Islamic Jihad targets.   ""We hope to reach a consensus to return to calm as soon as possible,"" the source said.   Israeli army spokesman Richard Hecht had earlier referred to Egyptian mediation when briefing reporters about the bombardment, without providing specifics.   An Egyptian source separately said that a delegation from Islamic Jihad may head to Cairo later Saturday.   Hamas, the Islamist group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, has so far stayed clear of the latest round of Gaza violence, but was also in talks with Egypt.   Its Doha-based leader Ismail Haniyeh has held talks with ""Egyptian intelligence"" over the violence, a Hamas statement said.   Egypt, a historic broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, negotiated the ceasefire that ended an 11-day conflict in May of last year.  az-gb/bs/gw",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113453221']

At his confirmation hearing, Blinken said he would ""immediately"" review the outgoing Trump administration's labeling of the Iranian-linked insurgents, fearing the move was worsening a humanitarian crisis.  ""At least on its surface, (the designation) seems to achieve nothing particularly practical in advancing the efforts against the Huthis and to bring them back to the negotiating table while making it even more difficult than it already is to provide humanitarian assistance to people who desperately need it,"" Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Donald Trump's administration announced the move on January 11, nine days before Biden takes over on Wednesday.  Trump has been a staunch ally of Saudi Arabia, offering US logistical help and military sales for its more than six-year campaign to dislodge the rebels who have taken over much of the country.  Blinken said that the Saudis have ""contributed to what is by most accounts the worst humanitarian situation anywhere in the world.""  ""The Huthis bear significant responsibility for what's happened in Yemen, but the way the campaign has been conducted has also contributed significantly to that situation. And so our support should end,"" Blinken said.    - Warnings from Huthis -    The United Nations and aid groups have warned the terrorist designation risks worsening the plight of a country where millions depend on aid to survive.  The designation took effect Tuesday, with the Huthis warning they would respond to any action against them.  ""We are ready to take all necessary measures against any hostile act,"" they said in a statement.  The designation is expected to halt many transactions with Huthi authorities, including bank transfers and payments to medical personnel and for food and fuel, due to fears of US prosecution.  Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, called on the United States to reverse the move.  ""Our position on this has not changed,"" Dujarric said. ""We call on the government to reverse that decision.""  ""Our concern from the beginning, that we expressed very clearly, is the impact on the commercial sector,"" he said.  ""The vast majority of food and other basic supplies that comes into Yemen comes in through the commercial sector.""  Outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in announcing the designation, pointed to an attack on the airport on Yemen's second city Aden in late December that apparently targeted Yemen's new government.  Blinken said the United States remained ""clear-eyed about the Huthis.""  ""They overthrew a government in Yemen, they engaged in a path of aggression through the country, they directed aggression toward Saudi Arabia and committed atrocities and human rights abuses,"" he said. ""And that is a fact.""  But he said that efforts by Pompeo to exempt aid groups were insufficient as they concerned US rather than international groups.  Aid groups fear that they will face legal problems in the United States by interacting with the Huthis, which they say is unavoidable as they are the de facto government in much of Yemen.  bur-sct/ft",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105046769']

The strike targeted a station in the city of Chaplyne in the region of Dnipropetrovsk, on Wednesday.  ""As of this morning, we have 25 dead, including two children, and 31 people injured, including two children,"" Ukrainian Railways said on Telegram on Thursday.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky first announced the strike in the evening on Wednesday -- as the nation marked the grim milestone of six months of war, and its annual Independence Day.  ""Chaplyne is our pain today,"" Zelensky said.  Since the war started in February, Ukraine's railways have been vital in the effort to evacuate vast swathes of the country.  In April, a rocket attack on a station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk killed at least 57 civilians as they waited on the platform to be transported west to safety.  As the war enters its seventh month most of the fighting between Russia and Ukraine is taking place in the south and east, with neither side conceding much territory.  Nonetheless Kyiv accuses Moscow of regularly striking Ukrainian cities with long-range missiles.  bur-brw/jts/ach",['http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q113612174']

A report from the Institute for Supply Management showed surprising strength in the massive US services sector, thanks to a jump in business activity and new orders even as some companies expressed recession fears.  A note from Oxford Economics described the ISM data as ""encouraging,"" but pointed to lingering questions about the direction of the economy.  ""The recovery's best days are clearly in the rearview mirror, but this doesn't mean a downturn has begun,"" Oxford said. ""We think fundamentals are strong enough to prevent a recession this year, though the window to achieving a softish landing is narrowing.""
